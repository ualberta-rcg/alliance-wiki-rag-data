[https://www.firedrakeproject.org/ Firedrake] is an automated system for the solution of partial differential equations using the finite element method (FEM). 

Please note that every release of Firedrake requires a specific version of PETSc and several other modules or Python wheels.

= Installation =

Please note that all modules must be loaded before creating and/or activating the Python virtualenv.

== Firedrake 2025.4.2 ==

{{Commands
|module load StdEnv/2023  gcc/12.3  openmpi/4.1.5  python/3.13  mpi4py/4.0.3  symengine/0.14.0  libspatialindex/1.9.3  petsc/3.23.4
|virtualenv venv-firedrake
|source venv-firedrake/bin/activate
|pip install -U pip
|pip install --no-index  firedrake[check]{{=}}{{=}}2025.4.2
}}

The above has been tested with both <code>python/3.13</code> as well as <code>python/3.12</code>.

= Optional dependencies =
Firedrake has a number of [https://www.firedrakeproject.org/install.html#optional-dependencies optional dependencies] that can be installed into the virtualenv:

* '''SLEPc''' and slepc4py are part of the petsc module and always available.
* '''netgen''': we provide [[Python#Available_wheels|precompiled wheels]] for <code>ngsPETSc</code> and <code>netgen_mesher</code>.
* '''PyTorch''': since we provide precompiled [[Python#Available_wheels|precompiled wheels]] for <code>torch</code>.
* '''Jax''': since we provide precompiled [[Python#Available_wheels|precompiled wheels]] for <code>jax</code>.
* '''VTK''': currently we don't have a module for VTK that supports recent enough versions of Python for Firedrake (Python 3.12 and newer).<br>As a temporary workaround VTK can be installed into the virtualenv with: <code>pip install --no-index --find-links ~stuekero/wheels/vtk vtk==9.4.2</code> until we install a new VTK module.
