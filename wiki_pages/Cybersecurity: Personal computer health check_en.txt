{What is the software update setting on your personal computer?
|type="()"}
- 	The software on my personal computer is out of support; there is no software update.
||Out of support software does not have security updates, which leaves your computer with a number of severe security weaknesses.  You should consider upgrading your computer to a supported version.
- 	I check and install software updates and security patches manually.
||There is a high chance that you may miss checking and installing software updates on your computer.  You should consider installing software updates automatically.
- 	I receive notifications about software updates but don't automatically install them.
||Installing software updates manually may leave security weaknesses on your computer for a significant timeframe.  You should consider installing software updates automatically.
- 	Software updates of the operating system are automatically downloaded and installed.
||Well done!  You have done a great job in updating your operating system, now it’s time to check the software update setting for other software applications.
+ 	In addition to the software updates of the operating system, other software applications are also set to install updates automatically.
||Awesome!  You have done a great job in updating your computer, keep up the good work!


{How do you manage your passwords for accessing Internet services such as emails, Internet banking, online shopping, etc.?
|type="()"}
- 	I use the same password on multiple Internet services and never change it.
||Having the same password on multiple Internet services means that a single compromised password will affect all of the services.  You should set unique passwords on Internet services.
- 	I follow a pattern (e.g. Tech0001, Tech0002, Tech0003) to create passwords and use them on multiple Internet services.
||Using a pattern to create passwords is not a secure way as attackers can guess other passwords from a single compromised password.
- 	I create unique passwords for accessing Internet services and record them in a text file, sticky notes, etc.
||It’s generally not a good idea to record passwords in a text file or sticky notes as others may be able to read your passwords.  If you really need to have something written down to memorize your passwords, try writing hints that only make sense to yourself.
- 	I create unique passphrases for accessing Internet services.
||Good job!  Passphrases have a good length and make it difficult to break.
+ 	I use a reputable password manager to create, store and change my passwords regularly.
||Well done!  Password managers create random and complex passwords which are strong enough to withstand password breaking.

{Is there any antivirus software installed on your personal computer?
|type="()"}
- 	No, there is no antivirus software installed on my personal computer
||You should check the availability of antivirus software for your operating system and consider installing one if it is available.  The most popular operating system needs an antivirus software to keep it safe from malware attacks.
- 	Yes, an antivirus software is installed on my personal computer, but I'm not sure whether it’s trustworthy.
||Installing a questionable antivirus software is as bad as having no antivirus installed.  Some are not effective in catching malwares and others are developed by hackers and act as a malware.  You should uninstall the questionable antivirus software and install a reputable one.
- 	Yes, a reputable antivirus software is installed on my personal computer.
||It’s nice to have a reputable antivirus software installed.  The next step is to set it to update automatically.
+ 	Yes, a reputable antivirus software is installed on my personal computer and it’s configured to update automatically.
||Excellent!  The antivirus software will significantly reduce the risk of malware infection on your computer.

{How do you configure the Wi-Fi router at your home?
|type="()"}
- 	I haven’t changed the default password on my home’s Wi-Fi router.
||Using default password on a Wi-Fi router may leave your home network wide open to attackers.  You should change the default password at your earliest.
- 	The default password has been modified on my home’s Wi-Fi router.
||Good work!  Changing the default password is the first step to protect your home network.  Now you can check and update the router’s firmware to the latest version to make it more secure.
+ 	The default password has been modified and firmware updates are installed on my home’s Wi-Fi router regularly.
||Excellent!  You have done a great job in protecting your home network.

{How do you connect your computer to public Wi-Fi spots?
|type="()"}
-	I connect my personal computer to public Wi-Fi spots whenever there's one available.
||Public Wi-Fi spots are open to everyone, including attackers.  As a result, the network traffic via public Wi-Fi spots is subject to eavesdropping attacks.  You should consider using a trustworthy VPN solution to protect your network connection while using public Wi-Fi spots.
- 	I would not connect my personal computer to public Wi-Fi spots without using a trustworthy VPN connection.
||Awesome!  Your network traffic is well protected by the VPN solution.  You may refer to [https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/secure-your-connections/public-wi-fi Public Wi-Fi] for other tips on using public Wi-Fi spots.
+	I do not connect my personal computer to public Wi-Fi spots.
||Nice!  It’s a good practice to avoid connecting Wi-Fi spots that may not be secure.
