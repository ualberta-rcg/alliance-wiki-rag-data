We offer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29 Infrastructure as a Service] that supports [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_virtualization virtualization].

A user of the cloud will typically create or <i>spin up</i> one or more virtual machines (VMs or <i>instances</i>). He or she then logs into the VM with administrative privileges, installs any desired software, and runs the software applications needed. These applications could be as diverse as a CPU-intensive analysis of particle physics data, or a web service directed towards scholars of literature and the humanities. The advantage is that the user has complete control over the collection of installed software (the <i>software stack</i>). The disadvantage is that the user must have some degree of experience in installing software and otherwise managing a computer.

Virtual machines can be easily replicated. One can take a <i>snapshot</i> of a VM which can then be started again elsewhere. This makes it easy to replicate or scale up a service, and to recover from (for example) a power interruption.

If you can fit your work easily into the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer HPC] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing batch] submission workflow and environment (see [[What is a scheduler?]]) it is preferable to work outside the cloud, as there are more [[National systems|resources available]] for HPC and software is already configured and installed for many common needs. There are also tools like [[Apptainer]] to run custom software stacks inside containers within our HPC clusters.
If your need isn't served by Apptainer or HPC batch, then the cloud is your solution.

==Getting a cloud project==
* Review and understand the [[Cloud shared security responsibility model|important role]] you are about to take on to [https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/safeguarding-your-research safeguard your research] and the shared cloud infrastructure.
* If you do not have an account with us, create one with [https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/account-management/apply-account these instructions].
* A [[Managing_your_cloud_resources_with_OpenStack#Projects|project]] is an allocation of resources for creating VMs within a cloud.
* If you are a primary investigator (PI) with an active cloud resource allocation (see [https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/research-portal/accessing-resources/resource-allocation-competitions RAC]) you should already have a project. See the sections below on using the cloud to get started. If not or if you are not sure please contact [[Technical support|technical support]].
* Otherwise go to the [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU_BoRk5cEz3AvVLf3e9yZJq-OvcFCQ-mg7p4AWXmUkd5rTw/viewform Alliance cloud project and RAS request form] to
** request access to an existing project (see the section below for information you will need to supply)
** and if you are a PI you may also
*** request a new project with our Rapid Access Service ([[Cloud_RAS_Allocations|RAS]]),
*** or request an increase in quota of an existing project.

* Requests are typically processed within two business days.

===Preparing your request===
* When requesting access to an existing project, you will need to know the project name and which cloud it is on. See the section on [[Managing_your_cloud_resources_with_OpenStack#Projects|projects]] for guidance on how to find the project name and the section about [[Cloud#Cloud_systems|cloud systems]] for a list of our clouds. Requests for access must be confirmed by the PI owning the project.
* When requesting either a new project or an increase in quota for an existing project some justification, in the form of a few sentences, is required:
**why you need cloud resources,
**why an HPC cluster is not suitable,
**your plans for efficient usage of your resources,
**your plans for maintenance and security ([[Security_considerations_when_running_a_VM|refer to this page]]).
*A PI may own up to 3 projects, but the sum of all project quotas must be within the [[Cloud_RAS_Allocations|RAS]] allocation limits. A PI may have both compute and persistent cloud RAS allocations.

==Creating a virtual machine on the cloud infrastructure==
* The [[Cloud Quick Start|cloud quick start guide]] describes how to manually create your first VM.
* Review the [[Cloud_Technical_Glossary|glossary]] to learn definitions of common topics.
* Consider [[Cloud_storage_options|storage options]] best suited to your use case.
* See the [[Cloud troubleshooting guide|troubleshooting guide]] for steps to deal with common issues in cloud computing.

==User responsibilities==
For each cloud project, you are responsible for
*[[Managing_your_cloud_resources_with_OpenStack | Creating and managing your virtual machines ]]
*[[Cloud_shared_security_responsibility_model|Securing and patching software on your VM]]
*[[Managing_your_cloud_resources_with_OpenStack#Security_groups|Defining security groups to allow access to your network]]
*[[Managing_your_Linux_VM|Creating user accounts]]
*[[VM Best Practices|Following best practices]]
*[[Security_considerations_when_running_a_VM|Considering security issues]]
*[[Backing_up_your_VM|Backing up your VMs]]

==Advanced topics==
More experienced users can
*[[Automating_VM_creation|Automatically create VMs]],
*Describe your VM infrastructure as code using [[Terraform]].
==Use cases==
More detailed instructions are available for some of the common cloud use cases, including
*[[Configuring a data or web server|Configure a data or web server]]
*[[Using cloud vGPUs|Using vGPUs (standard shared GPU allocation) in the cloud]]
*[[Using cloud gpu|Using PCI-e passthrough GPUs in the cloud]]
*[[Setting up GUI Desktop on a VM]]
*[[Using ipv6 in cloud|Using IPv6 in Arbutus cloud]]

==Cloud systems==
Your project will be on one of the following clouds:
* [https://beluga.cloud.computecanada.ca Béluga]
* [https://arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca Arbutus]
* [https://graham.cloud.computecanada.ca Graham]
* [http://cedar.cloud.computecanada.ca Cedar]
The details of the underlying hardware and OpenStack versions are described on the [[cloud resources]] page. The [[System status]] wiki page contains information about the current cloud status and future planned maintenance and upgrade activities.
