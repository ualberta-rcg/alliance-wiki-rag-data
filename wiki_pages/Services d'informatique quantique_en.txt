== Summary ==

Our team of quantum computing analysts provides expertise, support and training on quantum computing and hybrid classical-quantum computing. As of January, Calcul Québec offers access to a 24 qubit superconducting quantum computer called [[MonarQ/en|MonarQ]], available via the [[Narval/en|Narval]] cluster. See our page [[MonarQ]] for more details. 

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
See [[MonarQ/en#Getting_started|Getting started]] on the [[MonarQ]] page to get access to MonarQ.

<b>What is quantum computing?</b>

A quantum computer takes advantage of the characteristics of quantum particles (<i>qubits</i>), including superposition of states; constructive and destructive interference; and entanglement. With these properties, a new computational paradigm promises greater parallelization to solve complex problems that cannot be managed by classical computing systems.

== Applications ==
Optimization of complex problems is one of the most promising areas for quantum computing in several research areas:
* Machine learning: quantum computing could reduce training and processing times.
* Finance: quantum computing could speed up portfolio risk assessment and fraud detection.
* Molecular modelling: quantum computing could simulate more complex chemical systems and simulate reactions in real time.
* Meteorology: quantum computing could increase the number of variables for weather forecasting.
* Logistics: quantum computing could optimize logistics and workflow planning associated with supply chain management.

== Software ==

There are several specialized software libraries for performing quantum computing and developing quantum algorithms. You can use these libraries to build circuits that are run on simulators mimicking the performance and results obtained on a quantum computer. These libraries can be used on all of our clusters.  

* [[PennyLane/en|PennyLane]], Python library
* [[Snowflurry/en|Snowflurry]], Julia library
* [[Qiskit/fr|Qiskit]], Python library

== Training ==

Our team of analysts offers theoretical and practical training sessions at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. They are offered online or in person at one of our university sites, in French or English.

Sessions currently offered are:
* CIQ101, Introduction to quantum computing theory
* CIQ102, Introduction to quantum computing with PennyLane
* MNQ101, Getting started on MonarQ, Calcul Québec's superconducting quantum computer
