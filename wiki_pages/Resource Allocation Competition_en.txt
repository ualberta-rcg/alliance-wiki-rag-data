The Resource Allocation Competition (RAC) enables faculty members and their research groups to access compute, storage and cloud resources beyond what can be obtained via the [[Rapid Access Service]] (RAS). 

If you are not sure about which application process is best for your project, please email [mailto:allocations@tech.alliancecan.ca allocations@tech.alliancecan.ca].

You may also wish to consult the RAC [[RAC FAQ|Frequently Asked Questions]] and [https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Technical_glossary_for_the_resource_allocation_competitions Technical Glossary].
