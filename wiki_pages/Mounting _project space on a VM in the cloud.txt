===Introduction=== <!--T:1-->

<!--T:2-->
This document describes how to let a virtual machine (VM) access [[Project layout|/project]] filesystems on the national systems. VMs hosted on our [[Cloud]] do not have direct access to the filesystems on the national HPC clusters. In order to access files stored on /project from a VM, please use SSHFS and observe the requirements mentioned below.

===SSHFS=== <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
SSHFS enables mounting your /project folder inside your VM. 
SSHFS mounts appear like regular folders in your VM and can be accessed via regular Linux commands.

<!--T:5-->
A reference can be found at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSHFS

===Requirements=== <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
In order to avoid security issues, the following requirements are needed if you choose to mount /project inside your VM:

<!--T:8-->
* Do ''not'' store your password in plain text on the VM.
* Create an SSH key specifically for use with SSHFS, and ''only'' use it for that.  Do ''not'' use the same SSH key that you use for logging in.
* Keep your VM up to date and only open ports that are required and secured.
