Rorqual is a heterogeneous and versatile cluster designed for a wide variety of scientific calculations. Built by Dell Canada and CDW Canada, the cluster is located at the [https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/ École de technologie supérieure] in Montreal. Its name recalls the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorqual rorqual], a marine mammal of which several species can be observed in the St. Lawrence River.

==Access==
Each researcher must [https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_systems request access in CCDB], via <i>Resources--> Access Systems</i>.

==Site-specific policies==

Rorqual's compute nodes cannot access the internet. If you need an exception to this rule, contact [[Technical_support|technical support]] explaining what you need and why. 

The <code>crontab</code> tool is not offered.

Each job should have a duration of at least one hour (at least five minutes for test jobs) and you cannot have more than 1000 jobs, running or queued, at any given moment. The maximum duration is 7 days (168 hours).

* To get a larger <code>$SLURM_TMPDIR</code> space, a job can be submitted with <code>--tmp=xG</code>, where <code>x</code> is a value between 370 and 3360.

===CPU nodes===
The 192 cores and the different memory spaces are not equidistant, which causes variable delays (of the order of nanoseconds) to access data. In each node, there are

* 2 sockets, each with 12 system memory channels
** 4 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access NUMA] nodes per socket, each connected to 3 system memory channels
*** 3 chiplets per NUMA node, each with its own 32 MiB [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache L3 cache memory]
**** 8 cores per chiplet, each with its own 1 MiB L2 cache memory and 32+32 KiB L1 cache memory

In other words, we have
* groups of 8 closely spaced cores sharing a single L3 cache, which is ideal for [[Running_jobs#Threaded_or_OpenMP_job|multithreaded parallel programs]] (for example, with the <code>--cpus-per-task=8</code> option)
* NUMA nodes of 3x8 = 24 cores sharing a trio of system memory channels
* a total of 2x4x3x8 = 192 cores per node

To fully benefit from this topology, full nodes must be reserved (e.g., with <code>--ntasks-per-node=24 --cpus-per-task=8</code>) and the place of processes and threads must be explicitly controlled. Depending on the parallel program and the number of cores used, gains can be marginal or significant.

=== GPU nodes ===
The architecture is not as hierarchical.

* 2 sockets, each with
** 8 system memory channels
** 60 MiB L3 cache memory
** 32 equidistant cores, each each with its own 2 MiB L2 cache memory and 32+48 KiB L1 cache memory
** 2 NVidia H100 accelerators

The 4 node accelerators are interconnected by  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SXM_(socket) SXM5].

===GPU instances===

Available GPU instance names are:

|}

To request one or more full H100 GPUs, you need to use one of the following Slurm options:
* <b>One H100-80gb</b> : <code>--gpus=h100:1</code> or <code>--gpus=h100_80gb:1</code>
* <b>Multiple H100-80gb</b> per node :
** <code>--gpus-per-node=h100:2</code>
** <code>--gpus-per-node=h100:3</code>
** <code>--gpus-per-node=h100:4</code>
* <b> For multiple full H100 GPUs</b> spread anywhere: <code>--gpus=h100:n</code> (replace <code>n</code> with the number of GPUs you want)

Approximately half of the GPU nodes are configured with [[Multi-Instance GPU|MIG technology]], and only 3 GPU instance sizes are available:

* <b>H100-1g.10gb</b>: 1/8<sup>th</sup> of the computing power with 10GB GPU memory
* <b>H100-2g.20gb</b>: 2/8<sup>th</sup> of the computing power with 20GB GPU memory
* <b>H100-3g.40gb</b>: 3/8<sup>th</sup> of the computing power with 40GB GPU memory

To request <b>one and only one GPU instance</b> for your compute job, use the corresponding option:

* <b>H100-1g.10gb</b> : <code>--gpus=h100_1g.10gb:1</code>
* <b>H100-2g.20gb</b> : <code>--gpus=h100_2g.20gb:1</code>
* <b>H100-3g.40gb</b> : <code>--gpus=h100_3g.40gb:1</code>

The maximum recommended number of <b>CPU cores and system memory</b> per GPU instance is listed in [[Allocations and compute scheduling#Ratios_in_bundles|this table]].
