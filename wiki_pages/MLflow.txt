MLflow is an open-source '''experiment tracking''' and '''observability''' platform for AI and Machine Learning development. Contrary to to other similar platforms such as [[Weights & Biases (wandb)|WandB]] and [[Comet.ml]], it is possible to run MLflow locally on our systems and track experiments without internet connection and without any data ever leaving the cluster.
