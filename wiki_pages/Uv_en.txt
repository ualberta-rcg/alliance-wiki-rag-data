uv is an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.
You may be able to use it successfully, but will likely run into issues.

Some issues and pitfalls you may encounter:
* installation of not supported packages
* not finding packages available from modules
* filling your storage quotas


=Installing Python packages=
You can use <code>pip</code> on the systems; please see [[Python]].

Please make sure to use at least <code>pip>=25.0</code>:
{{Command|prompt=(ENV) [name@server ~]|pip install --no-index --upgrade pip}}

=Troubleshooting=

==Clean cache==
To remove the cache, use
{{Command|uv cache clean}}
then specify <code>--no-cache</code> to avoid using the cache.
