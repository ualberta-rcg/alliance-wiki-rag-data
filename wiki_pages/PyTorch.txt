[http://pytorch.org/ PyTorch] is a Python package that provides two high-level features:
* Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
* Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

<!--T:61-->
If you are porting a PyTorch program to one of our clusters, you should follow [[Tutoriel Apprentissage machine/en|our tutorial on the subject]].

= Disambiguation = <!--T:62-->

<!--T:19-->
PyTorch has a distant connection with [[Torch]], but for all practical purposes you can treat them as separate projects.

<!--T:37-->
PyTorch developers also offer [[#LibTorch|LibTorch]], which allows one to implement extensions to PyTorch using C++, and to implement pure C++ machine learning applications. Models written in Python using PyTorch can be converted and used in pure C++ through [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html TorchScript].

= Installation = <!--T:1-->

<!--T:20-->
==Latest available wheels==
To see the latest version of PyTorch that we have built:
{{Command|avail_wheels torch}}
For more information, see [[Python#Available_wheels |Available wheels]].

==Installing our wheel== <!--T:15-->

<!--T:25-->
The preferred option is to install it using the Python [https://pythonwheels.com/ wheel] as follows: 
:1. Load a Python [[Utiliser_des_modules/en#Sub-command_load|module]], thus <code>module load python</code>
:2. Create and start a [[Python#Creating_and_using_a_virtual_environment|virtual environment]].
:3. Install PyTorch in the virtual environment with <code>pip install</code>. 

<!--T:18-->
==== GPU and CPU ====
:{{Command|prompt=(venv) [name@server ~]|pip install --no-index torch }}

<!--T:672-->
{{Note|With H100 GPUs, Torch 2.5.1 and higher is required.}}

<!--T:21-->
====Extra====
In addition to <code>torch</code>, you can install <code>torchvision</code>, <code>torchtext</code> and <code>torchaudio</code>:
{{Command|prompt=(venv) [name@server ~]|pip install --no-index torch torchvision torchtext torchaudio }}

= Job submission = <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->
Here is an example of a job submission script using the python wheel, with a virtual environment inside a job:

= High performance with PyTorch = <!--T:164-->

== TF32: Performance vs numerical accuracy == <!--T:547-->

<!--T:548-->
On version 1.7.0 PyTorch has introduced support for [https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/ Nvidia's TensorFloat-32 (TF32) Mode], which in turn is available only on Ampere and later Nvidia GPU architectures. This mode of executing tensor operations has been shown to yield up to 20x speed-ups compared to equivalent single precision (FP32) operations and is enabled by default in PyTorch versions 1.7.x up to 1.11.x. However, such gains in performance come at the cost of potentially decreased accuracy in the results of operations, which may become problematic in cases such as when dealing with ill-conditioned matrices, or when performing long sequences of tensor operations as is common in deep learning models. Following calls from its user community, TF32 is now <b>disabled by default for matrix multiplications</b>, but still <b>enabled by default for convolutions</b> starting with PyTorch version 1.12.0.

<!--T:549-->
On clusters equipped with A100, H100, or newer Nvidia GPUs, users should be cognizant of the following:
# You may notice a significant slowdown when running the exact same GPU-enabled code with <code>torch < 1.12.0</code> and <code>torch >= 1.12.0</code>.
# You may get different results when running the exact same GPU-enabled code with <code>torch < 1.12.0</code> and <code>torch >= 1.12.0</code>.

<!--T:550-->
To enable or disable TF32 on <code>torch >= 1.12.0</code> set the following flags to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> accordingly:

<!--T:551-->
 torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = False # Enable/disable TF32 for matrix multiplications
 torch.backends.cudnn.allow_tf32 = False # Enable/disable TF32 for convolutions

<!--T:552-->
For more information, see [https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#tf32-on-ampere PyTorch's official documentation]

== Running on CPU == <!--T:165-->

<!--T:166-->
PyTorch natively supports parallelizing work across multiple CPUs in two ways: intra-op parallelism and inter-op parallelism.
* <b>intra-op</b> refers to PyTorch's parallel implementations of operators commonly used in Deep Learning, such as matrix multiplication and convolution, using [https://www.openmp.org OpenMP] directly or through low-level libraries like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_Kernel_Library MKL] and [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/api-based-programming/intel-oneapi-deep-neural-network-library-onednn.html OneDNN]. Whenever you run PyTorch code that performs such operations, they will automatically leverage multi-threading over as many CPU cores as are available to your job.
* <b>inter-op</b> parallelism on the other hand refers to PyTorch's ability to execute different parts of your code concurrently. This modality of parallelism typically requires that you explicitly design your program such that different parts can run in parallel. Examples include code that leverages PyTorch's Just-In-Time compiler <code>torch.jit</code> to run asynchronous tasks in a [https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#built-in-functions-and-modules TorchScript] program.

<!--T:167-->
With small scale models, we strongly recommend using <b>multiple CPUs instead of using a GPU</b>. While training will almost certainly run faster on a GPU (except in cases where the model is very small), if your model and your dataset are not large enough, the speed up relative to CPU will likely not be very significant and your job will end up using only a small portion of the GPU's compute capabilities. This might not be an issue on your own workstation, but in a shared environment like our HPC clusters, this means you are unnecessarily blocking a resource that another user may need to run actual large scale computations! Furthermore, you would be unnecessarily using up your group's allocation and affecting the priority of your colleagues' jobs.

<!--T:168-->
The code example below contains many opportunities for intra-op parallelism.

== Running on GPU == <!--T:205-->

<!--T:206-->
There is a common misconception that you should definitely use a GPU for model training if one is available. While this may ''almost always''  hold true (training very small models is often faster on one or more CPUs) on your own local workstation equipped with a GPU, it is not the case on our HPC clusters.

<!--T:207-->
Simply put, '''you should not ask for a GPU''' if your code is not capable of making a reasonable use of its compute capacity.

<!--T:208-->
GPUs draw their performance advantage in Deep Learning tasks mainly from two sources: 
 
# Their ability to parallelize the execution of certain key numerical operations, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply–accumulate_operation multiply-accumulate], over many thousands of compute cores compared to the single-digit count of cores available in most common CPUs.
# A much higher memory bandwidth than CPUs, which allows GPUs to efficiently use their massive number of cores to process much larger amounts of data per compute cycle.

<!--T:209-->
Like in the multi-cpu case, PyTorch contains parallel implementations of operators commonly used in Deep Learning, such as matrix multiplication and convolution, using GPU-specific libraries like [https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn CUDNN] or [https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen MIOpen], depending on the hardware platform. This means that for a learning task to be worth running on a GPU, it must be composed of elements that scale out with massive parallelism in terms of the number of operations that can be performed in parallel, the amount of data they require, or, ideally, both. Concretely this means, for example, large models (with large numbers of units and layers), large inputs, or, ideally, both.

<!--T:210-->
In the example below, we adapt the multi-cpu code from the previous section to run on one GPU and examine its performance. We can observe that two parameters play an important role: <code>batch_size</code> and <code>num_workers</code>. The first influences performance by increasing the size of our inputs at each iteration, thus putting more of the GPU's capacity to use. The second influences performance by streamlining the movement of our inputs from the Host's (or the CPU's) memory to the GPU's memory, thus reducing the amount of time the GPU sits idle waiting for data to process.

<!--T:211-->
Two takeaways emerge from this:

<!--T:212-->
# Increase your <code>batch_size</code> to as much as you can fit in the GPU's memory to optimize your compute performance.
# Use a <code>DataLoader</code> with as many workers as you have <code>cpus-per-task</code> to streamline feeding data to the GPU.

<!--T:213-->
Of course, <code>batch_size</code> is also an important parameter with respect to a model's performance on a given task (accuracy, error, etc.) and different schools of thought have different views on the impact of using large batches. This page will not go into this subject, but if you have reason to believe that a small (relative to space in GPU memory) batch size is best for your application, skip to [[PyTorch#Single_GPU_Data_Parallelism|Single GPU Data Parallelism]] to see how to maximize GPU utilization with small inputs.

== Data Parallelism == <!--T:63-->

<!--T:678-->
Data Parallelism, in this context, refers to methods to perform training over multiple replicas of a model in parallel, where each replica receives a different chunk of training data at each iteration. Gradients are then aggregated at the end of an iteration and the parameters of all replicas are updated in a synchronous or asynchronous fashion, depending on the method.

<!--T:679-->
Using this approach may provide a significant speed-up by iterating through all examples in a large dataset approximately N times faster, where N is the number of model replicas. 

<!--T:680-->
An important caveat of this approach, is that in order to get a trained model that is equivalent to the same model trained without Data Parallelism, the user must scale either the learning rate or the desired batch size in function of the number of replicas. See [https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/should-we-split-batch-size-according-to-ngpu-per-node-when-distributeddataparallel/72769/13 this discussion] for more information. 

<!--T:681-->
In the multiple-GPU case, each GPU hosts a replica of your model. Consequently, the model must be '''small enough to fit inside the memory of a single GPU'''.

<!--T:315-->
There are several ways to perform Data Parallelism using PyTorch. This section features tutorials on three of them: using the '''DistributedDataParallel''' class directly with one or multiple GPUs, and using the '''PyTorch Lightning''' package.

===Multi-GPU Data Parallelism=== <!--T:65-->

<!--T:66-->
The '''DistributedDataParallel''' class is the way [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html#comparison-between-dataparallel-and-distributeddataparallel recommended by PyTorch maintainers] to use multiple GPUs, whether they are all on a single node, or distributed across multiple nodes.

===Using PyTorch Lightning===
'''PyTorch Lightning''' is a Python package that provides interfaces to PyTorch to make many common, but otherwise code-heavy tasks, more straightforward. This includes training on multiple GPUs. The following is the same tutorial from the section above, but using PyTorch Lightning instead of explicitly leveraging the DistributedDataParallel class:

=== Single GPU Data Parallelism === <!--T:683-->

<!--T:684-->
In cases where a model is fairly small, such that it does not take up a large portion of GPU memory and it cannot use a reasonable amount of its compute capacity, it is <b>not advisable to use a GPU</b>. Use [[PyTorch#PyTorch_with_Multiple_CPUs|one or more CPUs]] instead. However, in a scenario where you have such a model, but have a very large dataset and wish to perform training with a small batch size, taking advantage of Data parallelism on a GPU becomes a viable option. 

<!--T:685-->
In the example that follows, we adapt the code from the previous section to run on a single GPU. This task is fairly small - with a batch size of 512 images, our model takes up about 1GB of GPU memory space, and it uses only about 6% of its compute capacity during training. This is a model that '''should not''' be trained on a GPU on our clusters. However, using Data Parallelism, we can fit several replicas of this model on a single GPU and increase our resource usage, while getting a nice speed-up. We use Nvidia's [https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/mps/index.html Multi-Process Service (MPS)], along with [https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/MPI MPI] to efficiently place multiple model replicas on one GPU:

==Fully Sharded Data Parallelism== <!--T:686-->
</translate>
Similar to [[Deepspeed]], Fully Sharded Data Parallelism ([https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html FSDP]) enables distributed storage and computing of different elements of a training task - such as optimizer states, model weights, model gradients and model activations - across multiple devices, including GPU, CPU, local hard disk, and/or combinations of these devices. This "pooling" of resources, notably for storage, allows models with massive amounts of parameters to be trained efficiently, across multiple nodes.

Note that, with FSDP, a model layer that gets sharded across devices may be collected inside a single device during a forward or backward pass. You should not use FSDP if your model has layers that do not fit entirely in the memory of a single GPU. See the section on [[PyTorch#Tensor_Parallelism|Tensor Parallelism]] to see how to deal with this case.
<translate>

==Tensor Parallelism== <!--T:687-->
</translate>
Tensor Parallelism (TP) is a model sharding approach that differs from FSDP in that the computation of a forward or backward pass through a model layer is split along with the layers' weights across multiple devices. In other words, while FSDP shards model weights across devices, it must still collect  shards together in the same device during certain computation steps. This introduces overhead from having to move model shards across devices, and it implies that individual FSDP layers, or sharded model blocks, must fit entirely in the memory of a single device. With TP on the other hand, computation steps are done locally in the device where a model shard is placed. 
 
<translate>

==Pipeline Parallelism== <!--T:688-->
</translate>
Pipeline Parallelism (PP) is a model sharding approach where the shards are groups of consecutive of layers of a model. Each shard, or block of sequential layers, gets placed on a different device, thus a forward or backward pass through the model means performing computations on each device ''in sequence''. This means that the farther away a block of layers is from the current block being used in a computation at any given time, the longer the device hosting it will have to wait for its turn to perform any computations. To mitigate this, in PP, every input batch is broken into ''"micro-batches"'', which are fed to the model in sequence. This ensures all devices stay busy as the first micro-batch reaches the last model block.
<translate>

<!--T:689-->
=Creating model checkpoints=
Whether or not you expect your code to run for long time periods, it is a good habit to create Checkpoints during training. A checkpoint is a snapshot of your model at a given point during the training process (after a certain number of iterations or after a number of epochs) that is saved to disk and can be loaded at a later time. It is a handy way of breaking up jobs that are expected to run for a very long time, into multiple shorter jobs that may get allocated on the cluster more quickly. It is also a good way of avoiding losing progress in case of unexpected errors in your code or node failures.

==With PyTorch Lightning== <!--T:157-->

<!--T:158-->
To create a checkpoint when training with <code>pytorch-lightning</code>, we recommend using the callbacks parameter of the <code>Trainer()</code> class. The following example shows how to instruct PyTorch to create a checkpoint at the end of every training epoch.  Make sure the path where you want to create the checkpoint exists.

</translate>
 callbacks = [pl.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(dirpath="./ckpt",every_n_epochs=1)]
 trainer = pl.Trainer(callbacks=callbacks) 
 trainer.fit(model)
<translate>

<!--T:160-->
This code snippet will also load a checkpoint from <code>./ckpt</code>, if there is one, and continue training from that point. For more information, please refer to the [https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pytorch_lightning.callbacks.model_checkpoint.html official PyTorch Lightning documentation].

==With custom training loops== <!--T:161-->

<!--T:162-->
Please refer to the [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/saving_and_loading_a_general_checkpoint.html official PyTorch documentation] for examples on how to create and load checkpoints inside of a training loop.

== During distributed training == <!--T:309-->

<!--T:310-->
Checkpointing can also be done while running a distributed training program. With PyTorch Lightning, no extra code is required other than using the checkpoint callback as described above. If you are using DistributedDataParallel or Horovod however, checkpointing should be done only by one process (one of the ranks) of your program, since all ranks will have the same state at the end of each iteration. The following example uses the first process (rank 0) to create a checkpoint:

<!--T:311-->
 if global_rank == 0:
        torch.save(ddp_model.state_dict(), "./checkpoint_path")

<!--T:314-->
You must be careful when loading a checkpoint created in this manner. If a process tries to load a checkpoint that has not yet been saved by another, you may see errors or get wrong results. To avoid this, you can add a barrier to your code to make sure the process that will create the checkpoint finishes writing it to disk before other processes attempt to load it. Also note that <code>torch.load</code> will attempt to load tensors to the GPU that saved them originally (<code>cuda:0</code> in this case) by default. To avoid issues, pass <code>map_location</code> to <code>torch.load</code> to load tensors on the correct GPU for each rank.

<!--T:313-->
 torch.distributed.barrier()
 map_location = f"cuda:{local_rank}"  
 ddp_model.load_state_dict(
 torch.load("./checkpoint_path", map_location=map_location))

<!--T:553-->
LibTorch allows one to implement both C++ extensions to PyTorch and '''pure C++ machine learning applications'''. It contains "all headers, libraries and CMake configuration files required to depend on PyTorch", as described in the [https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html documentation].

=== How to use LibTorch === <!--T:39-->

==== Setting up the environment ==== <!--T:40-->

<!--T:554-->
Load the modules required by Libtorch, then install PyTorch in a Python virtual environment:

<!--T:669-->
<tabs>
<tab name="StdEnv/2023">
 module load StdEnv/2023 gcc cuda/12.2 cmake protobuf cudnn python/3.11 abseil  cusparselt  opencv/4.8.1
 virtualenv --no-download --clear ~/ENV && source ~/ENV/bin/activate 
 pip install --no-index torch numpy 

<!--T:670-->
Note that the versions for the abseil, cusparselt and opencv modules may need to be adjusted,
depending on the version of the torch package.  In order to find out which version of those
modules was used to compile the Python wheel for torch, use the following command:

<!--T:671-->
{{Command
|prompt=$
|ldd $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/lib/libtorch_cuda.so {{!}} sed -n 's&^.*/\(\(opencv\{{!}}abseil\{{!}}cusparselt\)/[^/]*\).*&\1&p' {{!}} sort -u
|result=
abseil/20230125.3

}}
</tab>

 virtualenv --no-download --clear ~/ENV && source ~/ENV/bin/activate 
 pip install --no-index torch numpy 
</tab>
