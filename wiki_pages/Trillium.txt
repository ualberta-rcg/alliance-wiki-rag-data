<!--T:2-->
Trillium is a large parallel cluster built by Lenovo Canada and hosted by SciNet at the University of Toronto.

<!--T:4-->
The [[Trillium Quickstart]] has specific instructions for Trillium, where the user experience is similar to that on the other national clusters, but still slightly different.

<!--T:13-->
Current users transitioning from Niagara are strongly encouraged to peruse the documentation on the [[Transition from Niagara to Trillium]].

<!--T:11-->
=Installation and transition=
Due to limits on available power and cooling capacity there will be an interim period in which a significant portion of the old Niagara will be shut down in order to provide power for the new system's acceptance testing and transition. We'll update you when we have a better idea of Trillium's installation schedule.

<!--T:12-->
=Storage=
Parallel storage: 29 petabytes, NVMe SSD based storage from VAST Data.

<!--T:3-->
=High-performance network=
* Nvidia “NDR” Infiniband network
** 400 Gbit/s network bandwidth for CPU nodes
** 800 Gbit/s network bandwidth for GPU nodes
** Fully non-blocking, meaning every node can talk to every other node at full bandwidth simultaneously.

= Technical details = <!--T:14-->

== Cooling and energy efficiency == <!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
Trillium is fully direct liquid cooled using warm water (35–40 °C input), resulting in:

<!--T:17-->
* PUE below 1.03 (high energy efficiency)
* Use of closed-loop dry fluid coolers, avoiding evaporative towers and new water usage
* Heat reuse: Trillium supplies excess heat to nearby facilities to minimize climate impact

== Storage system == <!--T:18-->

<!--T:19-->
The VAST high-performance file system is comprised of a unified 29 PB NVMe-backed storage pool, with:

<!--T:20-->
* 29 PB effective capacity (deduplicated via VAST)
* 16.7 PB raw flash capacity
* 714 GB/s read bandwidth, 275 GB/s write bandwidth
* 10 million read IOPS, 2 million write IOPS
* POSIX and S3 access protocols under a unified namespace
* 48 C-Boxes and 14 D-Boxes for data services

== Backup and archive storage == <!--T:21-->

<!--T:22-->
An additional 114 PB HPSS tape-based archive is available for nearline storage:

<!--T:23-->
* Dual-copy archive across geographically separate libraries
* Used for both backup and archival purposes
* Backups are managed using Atempo backup software
