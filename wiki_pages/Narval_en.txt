Narval is a general purpose cluster designed for a variety of workloads; it is located at the [https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/home École de technologie supérieure] in Montreal. The cluster is named in honour of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narwhal narwhal], a species of whale which has occasionally been observed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

==Site-specific policies==

By policy, Narval's compute nodes cannot access the internet. If you need an exception to this rule, contact [[Technical_support|technical support]] explaining what you need and why. 

Crontab is not offered on Narval.

Each job on Narval should have a duration of at least one hour (five minutes for test jobs) and you cannot have more than 1000 jobs, running or queued, at any given moment. The maximum duration for a job on Narval is 7 days (168 hours).

==High-performance interconnect==

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand InfiniBand] [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/infiniband/qm8700/ Mellanox HDR] network links together all of the nodes of the cluster. Each hub of 40 HDR ports (200 Gb/s) can connect up to 66 nodes with HDR100 (100 Gb/s) with 33 HDR links divided in two (2) by special cables. The seven (7) remaining HDR links allow the hub to be connected to a rack containing the seven (7) central HDR InfiniBand hubs. The islands of nodes are therefore connected by a maximum blocking factor of 33:7 (4.7:1). In contrast, the storage servers are connected by a much lower blocking factor in order to maximize the performance.

In practice the Narval racks contain islands of 48 or 56 regular CPU nodes. It is therefore possible to run parallel jobs using up to 3584 cores with a non-blocking network. For larger jobs or ones which are distributed in a fragmented manner across the network, the blocking factor is 4.7:1. The interconnect remains a high-performance one nonetheless.

===AMD processors===
==== Supported instructions sets ====
Narval is equipped with 2nd and 3rd generation AMD EPYC processors which support the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#Advanced_Vector_Extensions_2 AVX2 instruction set]. This instruction set is the same as that found on the Intel processors on the nodes at [[Béluga/en#Node_characteristics|Béluga]], [[Cedar#Node_characteristics|Cedar]], [[Graham#Node_characteristics|Graham]] and [[Niagara#Node_characteristics|Niagara]].

Narval does not however support the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512 AVX512] instruction set, in contrast to the nodes of Béluga and Niagara as well as certain nodes of Cedar and Graham.

AVX2 is supported on nodes which have Broadwell type CPUs, while both instruction sets (AVX2 and AVX512) are on nodes with CPUs of type [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylake Skylake] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Lake_(microarchitecture Cascade Lake]. Consequently, an application compiled on the Broadwell nodes of Cedar and Graham, including their login nodes, will run on Narval, but it  will not be executable if it is compiled on Béluga or Niagara or on a Skylake or Cascade Lake node of Cedar or Graham. Such an application must be recompiled (see ''Intel compilers'' below)

====Intel compilers====
Intel compilers can compile applications for Narval's AMD processors with AVX2 and earlier instruction sets. Use the <tt>-march=core-avx2</tt> option to produce executables which are compatible with both Intel and AMD processors.

However, if you have compiled a program on a system which uses Intel processors and you have used one or more options like <tt>-xXXXX</tt>, such as <tt>-xCORE-AVX2</tt>, the compiled program will not work on Narval because the Intel compilers add additional instructions in order to verify that processor used is an Intel product. On Narval, the options <tt>-xHOST</tt> and <tt>-march=native</tt> are equivalent to <tt>-march=pentium</tt> (the old 1993 Pentium) and should <b>not</b> be used.

====Software environments====
[[Standard software environments|StdEnv/2023]] is the standard software environment on Narval; previous versions (2016 and 2018) have been blocked intentionally. If you need an application only available with an older standard environment, please write to [[Technical support]].

====BLAS and LAPACK libraries====
The Intel MKL library works with AMD processors, although not in an optimal way. We now favour the use of the FlexiBLAS library. For more details, please consult the page on [[BLAS and LAPACK]].

===GPU instances===

To request one or more full A100 GPUs, you need to use one of the following Slurm options:
* <b>One A100-40gb</b> : <code>--gpus=a100:1</code>
* <b>Multiple A100-40gb</b> per node:
** <code>--gpus-per-node=a100:2</code>
** <code>--gpus-per-node=a100:3</code>
** <code>--gpus-per-node=a100:4</code>
* <b> For multiple full A100 GPUs</b> spread anywhere: <code>--gpus=a100:n</code> (replace <code>n</code> with the number of GPUs you want)

Several GPU nodes are configured with [[Multi-Instance GPU|Multi-Instance GPU technology]]. Four sizes are available:

* <b>1g.5gb</b> : 1/8 compute capacity, GPU memory 5 GB
* <b>2g.10gb</b> : 2/8 compute capacity, GPU memory 10 GB
* <b>3g.20gb</b> : 3/8 compute capacity, GPU memory 20 GB
* <b>4g.20gb</b> : 4/8 compute capacity, GPU memory 20 GB (fewer of this version are available)

To request <b>one and only one</b> GPU instance for your compute job, options are :

* <b>1g.5gb</b> : <code>--gpus=a100_1g.5gb:1</code>
* <b>2g.10gb</b> : <code>--gpus=a100_2g.10gb:1</code>
* <b>3g.20gb</b> : <code>--gpus=a100_3g.20gb:1</code>
* <b>4g.20gb</b> : <code>--gpus=a100_4g.20gb:1</code>

The maximum recommended number of <b>CPU cores and system memory</b> per GPU instance is listed in [[Allocations and compute scheduling#Ratios_in_bundles|this table]].

<span id="Suivi_de_vos_tâches"></span>
==Monitoring jobs==

From the [https://portail.narval.calculquebec.ca/ Narval portal], you can monitor your jobs using CPUs and GPUs <b>in real time</b> or examine jobs that have run in the past. This can help you to optimize resource usage and shorten wait time in the queue.

You can monitor your usage of
* compute nodes,
* memory,
* GPU.

It is important that you use the allocated resources and to correct your requests when compute resources are less used or not used at all. For example, if you request 4 cores (CPUs) but use only one, you should adjust the script file accordingly.
