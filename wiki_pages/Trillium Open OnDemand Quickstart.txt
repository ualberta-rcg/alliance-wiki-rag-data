= Porting existing virtual environments to Open OnDemand = <!--T:123-->

<!--T:124-->
'''IMPORTANT: Because of the change of operating system and software stack, your existing virtual environment kernels for Python may not work right away in the OnDemand site. You should be able to activate your Python environments in a Trillium terminal (see below [[Trillium Open OnDemand Quickstart#Terminal access|Terminal access]]), with all required Trillium modules loaded, and then issue the command <b><code>venv2jup</code></b> to get them working correctly.'''

=Introduction= <!--T:125-->

<!--T:126-->
This guide will walk you through the basic steps to get started with the SciNet Open OnDemand portal.
Open OnDemand (OOD) is a web-based platform that provides access to a wide range of scientific applications and computing resources, such as Jupyter Lab, R Studio, and Visual Studio Code. It allows you to interact with Trillium through a web browser instead of via a terminal, without the need to install any software on your local machine. You will be able to perform file management, submit/monitor jobs and run applications interactively. More information on this project can be found at [https://openondemand.org https://openondemand.org].

=Logging into the Open OnDemand portal= <!--T:127-->

<!--T:128-->
[[Image:ood-dashboard.png|thumb|right|600px|link=Special:FilePath/ood-dashboard.png|Figure 1: Dashboard.]]

<!--T:129-->
To access the Open OnDemand portal, open a web browser and navigate to the following page: https://ondemand.scinet.utoronto.ca. You will be prompted to enter your Alliance username and password, followed by a second factor authentication via Duo or Yubikey. Once you have logged in, you will be taken to the Open OnDemand dashboard. From here you can access the various tools and applications available on the platform.

=File management= <!--T:130-->

<!--T:131-->
[[Image:ood-file-browser.png|thumb|right|600px|link=Special:FilePath/ood-file-browser.png|Figure 2: File browser.]]

<!--T:132-->
The Open OnDemand platform provides a file browser that allows you to manage your files and directories on the filesystem. To access the file browser, click on the '''Files''' tab and select which directory you want to manage from the drop-down (<code>HOME</code>, <code>SCRATCH</code> or <code>PROJECT</code>). You will be taken to the file browser interface, where you can:

<!--T:133-->
* Navigate through your directories
* Upload/download files
* Create new files/directories
* Delete files/directories
* Edit existing files

==Uploading files== <!--T:134-->

<!--T:135-->
The current file size upload limit is 10GB, if you need to upload a file larger than this or are facing upload issues due to a bad internet connection for example please try using [https://docs.scinet.utoronto.ca/index.php/Globus Globus]. There is a Globus button in the file browser at the top right, [[File:Globus_button.png|300px|link=Special:FilePath/Globus_button.png]], which will take you to the Globus web interface where you can log in with your Alliance username and password. The path navigated to in the Open OnDemand file browser will be the same path opened in Globus.

=Job submission= <!--T:136-->

<!--T:137-->
Open OnDemand also provides a job submission interface that allows you to submit batch jobs to Trillium. This can be useful when you need more resources than the interactive jobs provide, i.e. exclusive access to 192 cores and 755GB of memory on a Trillium compute node.

<!--T:138-->
The [https://github.com/RIKEN-RCCS/OpenComposer Open Composer] app provides a suite of Slurm job template scripts that can be submitted directly to the Trillium scheduler. It also provides an interface to monitor your submitted jobs, via the '''History''' tab. You can access Open Composer by navigating to the '''Jobs''' drop-down menu and selecting '''Open Composer''' or by clicking on one of the Slurm job templates e.g. '''MPI Slurm Job''', '''OpenMP Slurm Job''' and '''Hybrid MPI/OpenMP Slurm Job'''.

<!--T:139-->
[[Image:ood-oc-shortcuts.png|thumb|right|600px|link=Special:FilePath/ood-oc-shortcuts.png|Figure 3: Open Composer shortcuts.]]

<!--T:140-->
Once you have selected a job template, you will be taken to the job submission page. This is split between the job parameters on the left and the job script itself on the right. The job parameters let you control how many resources your job will use, such as the number of nodes, number of tasks per node, wall clock time and output file name. The job script section displays the script that will be submitted to the scheduler. Any changes made to the job parameters will be reflected in the job script automatically. You may also edit the job script directly if you wish.

<!--T:141-->
The extra fields at the top of the page allow you to change how your job is submitted:

<!--T:142-->
* '''Script Location''': specifies the directory where the job script will be saved and where your job will be run from.
* '''Script Name''': specifies the name of the job script file.
* '''Job Name''': specifies the name of the job that will appear in the job queue.
* '''Cluster''': allows you to change which cluster to submit your job to, e.g. Trillium (default) or Trillium-GPU. Selecting Trillium-GPU will provide an additional job parameter to request GPU resources [[File:ood-oc-gpus.png|100px|link=Special:FilePath/ood-oc-gpus.png]].

<!--T:143-->
Once you are happy with your job script, click on the '''Submit''' button to submit the job to the scheduler and save your script to the '''Script Location'''. If your job was submitted successfully, you will see a confirmation message at the top of the page with your job ID: [[File:ood-oc-job-submit.png|400px|link=Special:FilePath/ood-oc-job-submit.png]].

<!--T:144-->
[[Image:ood-oc-job.png|thumb|center|600px|link=Special:FilePath/ood-oc-job.png|Figure 4: Open Composer job script editor.]]

<!--T:145-->
Note: The template scripts provided in Open Composer are basic examples to get you started. You will need to modify the job script further to suit your specific needs, such as loading your required modules and specifying input/output files.

==Monitoring jobs in Open Composer== <!--T:146-->

<!--T:147-->
To monitor your submitted jobs in Open Composer, navigate to the '''History''' tab. This will display a list of all your submitted jobs, along with their status: Queued, Running, Completed, Failed. You can filter the jobs by using the '''Filter''' text box at the top right or by using the checkboxes below. Clicking on different column fields will give different information about the job:

<!--T:148-->
* '''Job ID''': opens the job in [https://my.scinet.utoronto.ca/ my.SciNet], which displays performance statistics and more detailed Slurm information about the job. Note: my.SciNet may show 'Not found or not permitted' if the job hasn't started yet or was cancelled.
* '''Application''': opens the job script editor of the template you used.
* '''Script Location''': opens an OOD file browser window at the location of the job script. Clicking on the small terminal icon will open a terminal in the job script location.
* '''Script Name''': displays the job script that was submitted to the scheduler.

<!--T:149-->
To resubmit or modify a previously run job click on the job script under the '''Script Name''' column and click '''Load Parameters'''. This will take you back to the job submission page where further modifications can be made to the job.

<!--T:150-->

==Supported applications== <!--T:151-->

<!--T:152-->
Open Composer currently supports the following applications:

<!--T:153-->
* MPI Slurm Job
* OpenMP Slurm Job
* Hybrid MPI/OpenMP Slurm Job
* Python Slurm Job
* R Slurm Job

=Job monitoring= <!--T:154-->

<!--T:155-->
To get an overview of all your jobs in the queue you can use the job monitoring interface. Navigate to the '''Jobs''' tab and select '''Active Jobs'''. You can filter the jobs by using the '''Filter''' text box at the top right. Columns can also be sorted by clicking on the column headers, for example you can sort by job status (running, completed, failed, etc.). Clicking on <code>></code> to the left of a job will show you more details about the job, such as the start/end time, node list and account charged etc. You might also want to show all jobs in the queue, you can do this by clicking on the drop-down menu at the top right and selecting '''All Jobs'''. A more detailed view of your jobs can still be found using the [https://my.scinet.utoronto.ca myscinet portal].

<!--T:156-->
[[Image:ood-active-jobs.png|thumb|center|600px|link=Special:FilePath/ood-active-jobs.png|Figure 6: Active Jobs.]]

=Interactive applications= <!--T:157-->

<!--T:158-->
Open OnDemand also features interactive applications that can be run directly from your web browser. To access the applications, navigate to the '''Interactive Apps''' tab and select the application you want to run from the drop-down. This will then bring you to the job submission page where you can choose job parameters such as:

<!--T:159-->
* Length of job in hours
* Number of cores
* Amount of memory to allocate (GB)
* Notify me by email when the job starts

<!--T:160-->
When you have chosen your job parameters click on the '''Launch''' button to submit your job to the queue. You will be taken to the '''My Interactive Sessions''' page where you can see the status of your job, i.e. queued, running or completed. Once the job has been assigned a node and is running, you can click on the '''Connect to ...''' button to launch the application. The application will open in a new tab in your browser, and you can interact with it as if it was running locally.

<!--T:161-->
If you would like terminal access to the node where the application is running, to monitor the performance for example you can click on the button beside '''Host''' starting with <code>>_</code>. This will open a terminal window in your browser where you can run commands on the node directly.

<!--T:162-->
If for whatever reason you would like to kill the job, you can do so by clicking on the red '''Delete''' button in the job panel in the '''My Interactive Sessions''' page.

=Running an application GUI= <!--T:168-->

<!--T:169-->
If you would like to run software that has a graphical user interface (GUI) and is not yet installed as an interactive application, such as Octave or Blender, you can do so using the '''Trillium Desktop''' application. This app provides a remote desktop environment that you can access through your web browser. In the following example, we will run Octave's GUI:

<!--T:170-->
# Navigate to the '''Interactive Apps''' tab and select '''Trillium Desktop''' from the drop-down.
# You will be taken to the job submission page. Choose how many cores and amount of memory you would like to allocate for your session in addition to your job length in hours. Then click on the '''Launch''' button to submit your job to the queue.
# This will take you to the '''My Interactive Sessions''' page. Once your job is running, you have the option to improve the '''Image Quality''' and '''Image Compression''' of the desktop session. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, you may want to set these lower to improve performance and responsiveness of the desktop. Click on the '''Connect to Trillium Desktop''' button to launch the remote desktop environment in a new tab.
# Once the desktop environment has loaded, open a terminal window using the desktop shortcut and load the required modules for Octave:
#:<pre> $ module load StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 openmpi/4.1.5 octave/7.2.0</pre>
# Now launch Octave's GUI by typing <code>octave --gui</code> in the terminal window.

<!--T:171-->
You should now see Octave's GUI appear in the remote desktop environment. You can use this method to run other GUI applications as well, just make sure to load the appropriate modules before launching the application. Applications may have different ways to launch their GUI, so please refer to the application's documentation for more information. You can see the list of binaries installed for a given application by looking at its environment variable, e.g. run <code>ls $EBROOTOCTAVE/bin</code> to see the list of Octave binaries.

<!--T:172-->

=Terminal access= <!--T:173-->

<!--T:174-->
[[Image:ood-terminal.png|thumb|right|600px|link=Special:FilePath/ood-terminal.png|Figure 11: Terminal]]

<!--T:175-->
Sometimes you might prefer to use a terminal to interact with Trillium, Open OnDemand provides a web-based terminal that you can use to access the command-line interface. To access the terminal, navigate to the '''Clusters''' tab and select '''Trillium Shell Access'''. This will open a new tab in your browser with a terminal window where you can run commands as you would in a regular terminal session.

= Debugging errors = <!--T:176-->

<!--T:177-->
[[Image:ood-session-id.png|thumb|right|600px|link=Special:FilePath/ood-session-id.png|Figure 12: Accessing error logs via the session card]]

<!--T:178-->
If you encounter any errors while using an interactive Open OnDemand job, you can check the logs for more information. To access the logs, navigate to the '''My Interactive Sessions''' tab and find your active session. Click on the <code>output.log</code> link (see Figure. 12) to open a separate tab which displays the output of your job. This file contains the standard output and error messages generated by the job, which can help you identify any issues that may have occurred during the session. When submitting a ticket to SciNet support, please include the <code>output.log</code> file, your '''Session ID''', which is displayed as a long string of characters, e.g. ''' 8feb45fa-bc65-4846-8398-2a73c1bf8e5a''', and any other relevant information to help us assist you more effectively.
