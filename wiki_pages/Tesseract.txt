[https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract Tesseract] is an open source text recognition (OCR) Engine with support for over a hundred languages.

== Downloading language models ==
Tesseract needs language models to be able to transcribe images. These can be downloaded from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata. Download the ones that you want and save them in a directory.

Then you need to tell Tesseract where to find the models using the environment variable <code>TESSDATA_PREFIX</code>. For example, if you save the models in <code>~/tessdata</code>, then you would use the follow command:

 export TESSDATA_PREFIX=~/tessdata

== Using from Python ==
Tesseract can be used from Python using the wrapper package "pytesseract". We recommend you install this in a [[Virtualenv]].
