[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git Git] is a distributed, fast and secure source code management tool. The official Git website is [https://git-scm.com/ git-scm.com]. Git was created by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds Linus Torvalds] for the Linux project and is currently maintained by Junio Hamano.

== Operating principle ==
Contrary to older source code management tools, Git works in a distributed way. This means that developers do not depend on a central repository to commit their changes. Each Git repository contains the full history of the project. Each Git object (changeset, file, directory) is the leaf of a tree with multiple branches. Developing a project with Git is based on a model in which one branch corresponds to one feature. Many revisions of the feature may be archived before the branch gets merged with the main trunk. For a detailed explanation of branch development, we recommend reading [http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ this page].

One especially interesting technique is ''cherry-picking'', which is essentially taking part of a branch and merging it with another one. 

== Basic usage ==
Generally, a project developer will:

# configure the global Git environment;
# clone or create a repository;
# make changes;
# commit changes;
# push changes to another repository.

Since Git is distributed, there may not be an authoritative repository.

=== Configuring the global Git environment ===
This section is based on the [https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup.html Software Carpentry - ''Version Control with Git''] lesson. When you start developing on a new system, you want to configure:

* Your name and email address, which will be associated with every commit. Note: this information will become <b>public</b> if you push your revisions to a public repository.
{{Commands
| git config --global user.name "First-name Last-name"
| git config --global user.email "email@address.ca"
}}
* Limit yourself to only four threads, otherwise, your <code>git clone</code> commands may fail if they are using too many threads.
{{Command|git config --global pack.threads 4}}
* If you are not used to <code>vi</code>, you can set a different text editor for your commit messages.
{{Command|git config --global core.editor "nano -w"}}
* Finally, you may want to redefine the default name for the initial branch name. For example, <code>main</code>.
{{Command|git config --global init.defaultBranch main}}

To list all options set in the global environment, run the following command.
{{Command|git config --list --global}}

=== Creating or cloning a repository ===

The first step is usually to create your own repository, or to clone an existing one.

To create a repository:
{{Command|git init my-project}}

To clone a repository:
{{Command|git clone git://github.com/git/git.git}}

=== Committing a change ===
When the repository is ready, you change directory and edit the file.
{{Commands
| cd my-project
| nano file.txt
}}

When work is done, you add the file
{{Command|git add file.txt}}
then commit the change
{{Command|git commit }}

If the repository was cloned, it is now possible to push your changes to the original repository with
{{Command|git push origin main}}

In the above command, ''origin'' is the remote repository and ''main'' is the current branch that will be pushed.

You might have to use <tt>git push origin master</tt> for older git repositories. 
== Hosting Git repositories ==
[http://github.com GitHub] and [http://bitbucket.org Bitbucket] are two of the main Git repository hosting services. They are both available for commercial projects as well as free projects.


== Troubleshooting ==

=== Unable to create thread ===
If you see:

 fatal: unable to create thread: Resource temporarily unavailable
 fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output

This is caused by resource limitations on the cluster login nodes. The solution is to limit the number of threads to 2. Use the following command on each cluster:

{{Command|git config --global pack.threads "2"}}
