<b>Killarney</b> is a cluster dedicated to the needs of the Canadian scientific Artificial Intelligence community. <b>Killarney</b> is located at the [https://www.utoronto.ca/ University of Toronto] and is managed by the [https://vectorinstitute.ai/ Vector Institute]  and [https://www.scinethpc.ca/ SciNet]. It is named after the [https://www.ontarioparks.ca/park/killarney Killarney Ontario Provincial Park], located near Georgian Bay.

<!--T:3-->
This cluster is part of the Pan-Canadian AI Compute Environment (PAICE).

<!--T:13-->
==Site-specific policies==
Killarney is currently open to Vector affiliated PIs with CCAI Chairs. Further access will be announced at a later date.

<!--T:14-->
==Access==
To access Killarney, each researcher must [https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_services request access in the CCDB].

<!--T:15-->
Principal Investigators must be granted an AIP-type RAP (prefix <code>aip-</code> ) by their AI Institution. For the PI to sponsor researchers in their AIP RAP, the PI must:

<!--T:16-->
* Go to the "Resource Allocation Projects" table on the CCDB Home page.
* Locate the RAPI of your AIP project (with the aip- prefix) and click on it to reach the RAP management page.
* At the bottom of the RAP management page, click on "Manage RAP memberships."
* Enter the CCRI of the user you want to add in the "Add Members" section.

|-
| <b>Home space</b>||
* Location of /home directories.
* Each /home directory has a small fixed [[Storage and file management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies|quota]].
* Larger requests go to the /project space.
* Has daily backup
|-
| <b>Scratch space</b>||
* For active or temporary (scratch) storage.
* Large fixed [[Storage and file management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies|quota]] per user.
* Inactive data will be [[Scratch purging policy|purged]].

==Network interconnects== <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
Standard Compute nodes are interconnected with Infiniband HDR100 for 100Gbps throughput, while Performance Compute nodes are connected with 2 x HDR 200 for 400Gbps aggregate throughput.

<!--T:11-->
==Scheduling==
The <b>Killarney</b> cluster uses the Slurm scheduler to run user workloads. The basic scheduling commands are similar to the other national systems.

<!--T:12-->
==Software==
* Module-based software stack.
* Both the standard Alliance software stack as well as cluster-specific software.
