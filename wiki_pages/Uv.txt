{{Warning
|title=Not supported
|content=uv is currently '''not''' supported on our clusters.
}}
uv is an extremely fast Python package and project manager written in Rust. While you may be able to use it to install some packages, it will likely fail for others.

<!--T:2-->
Some issues and pitfalls you may encounter:
* some packages are distributed in a format that is incompatible with our clusters, but uv tries to install them nonetheless;
* uv is unaware of the Python packages provided by loaded modules;
* uv can quickly fill up your /home directory quota since it stores a very large number of files in its cache.

=Installing Python packages=
To install packages on our clusters, use <code>pip</code>; see [[Python]].

<!--T:4-->
Make sure to use at least <code>pip>=25.0</code>.
{{Command|prompt=(ENV) [name@server ~]|pip install --no-index --upgrade pip}}

==Clearing the cache==
To clear the uv cache, use
{{Command|uv cache clean}}
Then, to avoid using the cache, use <code>uv --no-cache</code>.
