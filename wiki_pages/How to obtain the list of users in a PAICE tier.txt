The list of users that have requested Tier3 or Tier 4 access on any PAICE site is available to any PAICE administrator with a Privileged Federation staff role or higher permissions on CCDB.

Note that while Tier 1 and Tier 2 have services that follow the convention aip-[site]-tier1 this is not the case for Tiers 3 and 4, which each have a generic <code>aip-tier3</code> and <code>aip-[site]-tier1</code> services (For more details, read this [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FElUHpJ6ZFBVpP6vH4QSA3YuofszPFyW/edit) document]).

So in oder to see if which users from a particular site (for example, Mila) have requested Tier 3 and/or Tier 4 access, there are two lists that need to be downloaded and some crosscheck needs to be done between the two.

For example, if an administrator at MIla wants to see the list of email addresses of the users that a) have requested Tier 3 access  (which is done in this page https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/paice/general_access_to_paice_systems) and b) have also requested access to Tamia (https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_systems), then follow these steps (the same process applies if the intention is to get a list from a Tier4 service):

1. Go to <code>Browse</code> → <code>Services</code> in the main CCDB menu.

2. Type in “tier3” in the search box of the Generic services table

<br/>
<br/>

3. Click on <code>aip-tier3</code> under the “Name” column.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Once inside the <code>aip-tier3</code> service page, click on the '''Export to CSV''' button. This CSV will provide the list of any active role that has requested access to a Tier3 service (but this list does not specifically show who has also requested access to the Tamia system).
<br/>
<br/>
5. Go to the main Services page again (<code>Browse</code> → <code>Services</code> in the main CCDB menu).

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and in the search box of the System agreements panel, type in “tamia”.[[File:Screenshot 2026-02-18 at 4.18.02 PM.png|left|thumb]]

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

7. Click on the <code>tamia-access</code> link under the “Name” column.
<br/>
<br/>
8. Once inside the tamia-access service page, click on the '''Export to CSV''' button. This CSV will provide the list of any active role that has requested access to the Tamia system (but it does not indicate which service, if any, the role is a member of).


You can now put these two lists in Excel or Google Sheet and use a simple VLOOKUP formula cross check which users show in both: that is the list of users that requested Tier 3 access AND requested access to the Tamia system. 

'''Note:''' To get the list of users that requested access to a tier 1-2 service and to Tamia, follow the same process but simply replace <code>aip-tier3</code> with the appropriate <code>aip-[site]-tier1</code> or <code>aip-[site]-tier2</code>—the rest of the process should be identical.

Important: Note that some users may request access to a Tier 3 service but NOT to the Tamia system (or vice versa), so do not be surprised when you see that your VLOOKUP formula returns some ''#N/A''.
