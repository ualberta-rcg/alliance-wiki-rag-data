    "question": "How can the performance of code compiled with and without managed memory be demonstrated?",
    "answer": "The performance can be demonstrated by benchmarking codes compiled with and without the '-ta=tesla:managed' option, as shown in the 'Benchmark-DM.png' and 'Benchmark2-DM.png' examples."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the benchmark results suggest about data locality?",
    "answer": "The results suggest that data locality indeed works: when most operations are on the GPU and data remains on the GPU for an extended period, data movement does not significantly impact performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might some tests show improved speed using managed memory?",
    "answer": "Some tests might show improved speed using managed memory, possibly due to the use of pinned memory in the data transfers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the challenge presented in the document regarding data directives?",
    "answer": "The challenge is to modify existing code to use explicit data directives (either `kernels` or `parallel loop`), change compiler flags to `-ta=tesla` (not managed), and then verify if the results and performance are consistent with previous runs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find the solution for the challenge of adding data directives?",
    "answer": "The solution for the challenge can be found in the `step2.*` directories of the [https://github.com/calculquebec/cq-formation-openacc Github repository]."
  },
  {
    "question": "What compiler flag change is required for the challenge related to explicit data directives?",
    "answer": "For the challenge, the compiler flags should be changed to `-ta=tesla`, explicitly removing the `:managed` option."
