    "question": "What is the purpose of the Colvars module in GROMACS?",
    "answer": "The Colvars module adds additional capabilities of collective variables to apply biasing potentials, calculate potentials-of-mean-force (PMFs), and use enhanced sampling methods like Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF), metadynamics, steered MD, and umbrella sampling in molecular simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which GROMACS versions required patching for Colvars modifications?",
    "answer": "GROMACS versions prior to v2024 required patching with Colvars modifications to enable the use of collective variables in simulations."

  {
    "question": "What modules are needed to run `gromacs-colvars/2020.6` on CPUs?",
    "answer": "To run `gromacs-colvars/2020.6` on CPUs, you need to load `StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 openmpi/4.0.3 gromacs-colvars/2020.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are needed to run `gromacs-colvars/2020.6` on GPUs with CUDA?",
    "answer": "To run `gromacs-colvars/2020.6` on GPUs with CUDA, you need to load `StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 cuda/11.4 openmpi/4.0.3 gromacs-colvars/2020.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is CP2K?",
    "answer": "CP2K is a quantum chemistry and solid-state physics software package."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did GROMACS start supporting CP2K?",
    "answer": "GROMACS has supported CP2K since version 2022, allowing it to be compiled with CP2K-support for Hybrid Quantum-Classical (QM/MM) simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are `gromacs-cp2k` modules available for GPUs?",
    "answer": "No, `gromacs-cp2k` modules are only available for CPU calculations and not for GPUs (CUDA)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What MPI-enabled executables are included in `gromacs-cp2k` modules?",
    "answer": "The `gromacs-cp2k` modules include `gmx_mpi` for mixed precision GROMACS with OpenMP and MPI, and `gmx_mpi_d` for double precision GROMACS with OpenMP and MPI."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are required to run `gromacs-cp2k/2022.2` on CPUs?",
    "answer": "To run `gromacs-cp2k/2022.2` on CPUs, you need to load `StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 openmpi/4.0.3 gromacs-cp2k/2022.2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find resources for running QM/MM simulations with GROMACS and CP2K?",
    "answer": "Resources can be found in the GROMACS manual on Hybrid Quantum-Classical simulations, the CP2K QM/MM Best Practices Guide by BioExcel, BioExcel's workshop material on QM/MM with GROMACS + CP2K, a GitHub Repository with example files for the BioExcel Tutorial, and the GROMACS-CP2K integration page on the CP2K homepage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is GROMACS-LS used for?",
    "answer": "GROMACS-LS, which includes the MDStress library, enables the calculation of local stress fields from molecular dynamics simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations of GROMACS-LS?",
    "answer": "GROMACS-LS requires compilation in double precision, does not support MPI, SIMD hardware acceleration, or GPUs, and can only use a single CPU core, making it much slower than normal GROMACS."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the `gromacs-ls/2016.3` module?",
    "answer": "The `gromacs-ls/2016.3` module can be loaded using `StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 gromacs-ls/2016.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can `gromacs-ls/2016.3` and `gromacs/2016.6` be loaded simultaneously?",
    "answer": "Yes, unlike other patched GROMACS versions, the modules `gromacs-ls/2016.3` and `gromacs/2016.6` can be loaded at the same time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why would you use the `gromacs/2016.6` module in conjunction with GROMACS-LS?",
    "answer": "The `gromacs/2016.6` module can be used to prepare TPR input files for GROMACS-LS, especially if analyzing trajectories simulated with newer GROMACS versions, as older GROMACS-LS may not read newer TPR files directly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which commands should be used with GROMACS-LS instead of older syntax?",
    "answer": "For GROMACS-LS, commands like `gmx_LS mdrun` and `gmx_LS trjconv` should be used instead of the older `mdrun_LS` and `trjconv_LS`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if a `*.mdp` file used with a newer GROMACS version contains keywords not present in GROMACS-LS 2016.3?",
    "answer": "Keywords or features not present in GROMACS 2016 (e.g., `pcouple = C-rescale`) should either be changed or removed (e.g., to `pcouple = Berendsen`) when preparing a new TPR file with `gmx_LS grompp` or `gmx grompp` from version 2016.6 for use with GROMACS-LS 2016.3."
