    "question": "What is the first step to prepare an Ansys Workbench project file for submission to a cluster queue?",
    "answer": "The first step is to connect to the cluster using TigerVNC and switch to the directory where the project file (e.g., YOURPROJECT.wbpj) is located. Then, start Workbench with the same Ansys module used to create the project."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you clear all generated data within an Ansys Workbench project before submitting it to a cluster?",
    "answer": "After opening the project in Workbench, right-click on 'Setup' in the main window and select 'Clear All Generated Data'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do after clearing generated data in Ansys Workbench and before quitting?",
    "answer": "After clearing generated data, go to the top menu bar, select 'File -> Exit' to exit Workbench. When prompted 'The current project has been modified. Do you want to save it?', click the 'No' button."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you submit an Ansys Workbench project file to the queue using Slurm?",
    "answer": "A project file can be submitted to the queue by customizing one of the provided Slurm scripts and then running the `sbatch script-wbpj-202X.sh` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you prevent the Workbench solution from being overwritten each time a test job completes successfully?",
    "answer": "To prevent overwriting the solution, either remove `;Save(Overwrite=True)` from the last line of your Slurm script, or keep a copy of the initialized `YOURPROJECT.wbpj` file and its corresponding `YOURPROJECT_files` subdirectory and restore them after the solution is written."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `MEMPAR` variable in the Ansys Workbench Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "The `MEMPAR` variable determines the parallel execution type: `MEMPAR=0` is set for SMP (shared memory parallel) when running on a single node, and `MEMPAR=1` is set for DMP (distributed memory parallel) when running on multiple nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `sbatch` parameters are specified in the 'Single node (StdEnv/2023)' Workbench Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The script specifies `#SBATCH --account=def-account`, `#SBATCH --time=00-03:00`, `#SBATCH --mem=16G`, `#SBATCH --ntasks=4`, and `#SBATCH --nodes=1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are multi-node Workbench jobs supported by the provided Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "No, the provided Slurm scripts for Workbench explicitly state `#SBATCH --nodes=1 # Do not change (multi-node not supported)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Ansys and environment modules are loaded in the 'Single node (StdEnv/2023)' Workbench Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The script loads `StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2023R2` (or newer Ansys module versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variables are exported in the Workbench Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "The scripts export `KMP_AFFINITY=disabled` and `I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP=ssh`."
