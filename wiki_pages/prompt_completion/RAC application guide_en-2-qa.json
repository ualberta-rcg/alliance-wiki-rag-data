  {
    "question": "What are the eligibility criteria for a Principal Investigator (PI) to submit a RAC application?",
    "answer": "To be eligible, a PI must be a faculty member at a Canadian academic institution and have an active Alliance account in the CCDB with an Academic PI role (Faculty, Adjunct Faculty or Librarian)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many RRG applications can a PI submit at one time?",
    "answer": "A PI can apply as PI for only one RRG application at a time, either through the full application or the Fast Track process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many RPP applications can a PI lead per competition round?",
    "answer": "A PI can be the PI for one RPP application per competition round."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a PI be involved in multiple RRG or RPP submissions in different roles?",
    "answer": "Yes, a PI can be involved in multiple RRG submissions as a co-PI or a collaborator, and in other RPP applications as a co-PI."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a PI do if they recently moved institutions before submitting a RAC application?",
    "answer": "If a PI recently moved to a different institution and has not yet applied for a new faculty role on the CCDB portal, they must do so before submitting their RAC application."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a PI ensure their most up-to-date position is set as their primary role in the CCDB portal?",
    "answer": "The PI should go to the 'Home' page in the CCDB portal to see which role is primary and, if needed, click on the 'Make this role primary' button next to the new role they want to set as primary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of applications will not be accepted in the RAC competition?",
    "answer": "\"Departmental\" applications, which are submitted on behalf of a group of PIs not collaborating in a common research project with clear goals and outcomes, will not be accepted."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who qualifies as a Co-PI in the context of this competition?",
    "answer": "A Co-PI is any Canadian faculty with an Alliance Academic PI role that is actively involved in the computational project."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the requirements for Co-PIs listed in a RAC application?",
    "answer": "The PI and any Co-PI must upload an updated CCV with the application, and the role and involvement of any Co-PI listed must be justified."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can be considered a Collaborator in a RAC application?",
    "answer": "A Collaborator is any other person actively participating in the project that cannot be listed as a co-PI, including international investigators or colleagues without an Alliance account."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances should a user avoid submitting a RAC application?",
    "answer": "If your need for computational resources can be met with what will be available via the Rapid Access Service (RAS), do not submit a RAC application."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which types of storage are not allocated through the RAC?",
    "answer": "/HOME storage and /SCRATCH storage are not allocated through the RAC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum CPU request for HPC resources to be eligible for a RAC application?",
    "answer": "A CPU request must be equal to or greater than 200 core-years or core-equivalent-years in each of the clusters where these resources are needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is 'core-equivalent-years' calculated for CPU requests with high memory per core?",
    "answer": "Core-equivalent-years are calculated using the formula: MAX(cores, mem requested / 4GB), where Mem requested = CY * mem per core requested. The resulting calculation must be greater than 200."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum GPU request for HPC resources to be eligible for a RAC application?",
    "answer": "A GPU request must be equal to or greater than 25 reference GPU units (RGU) years in each of the clusters where these resources are needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does RGU stand for and what does it represent?",
    "answer": "RGU stands for Reference GPU Unit, and it is a unit measuring the cost of utilizing a particular GPU model, whose RGU value varies based on performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some examples of RGU values for different GPU models?",
    "answer": "For example, 1 GPU A100-40GB = 4.0 RGU, 1 GPU H100_2g.20GB = 3.5 RGU, and 1 GPU H100-80GB = 12.2 RGU."
