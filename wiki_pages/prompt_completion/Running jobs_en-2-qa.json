    "question": "What information does the `squeue` command display by default?",
    "answer": "By default, `squeue` supplies information about all jobs in the system, not just your own."

  {
    "question": "How can a user find the account name that corresponds to a Resource Allocation Project (RAP)?",
    "answer": "To find the account name, log in to CCDB, click on 'My Account -> My Resources and Allocations', and look under the 'Group Name' column for the relevant project."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a Resource Allocation Project (RAP) always be used across different clusters?",
    "answer": "No, a Resource Allocation Project may only apply to a specific cluster (or set of clusters) and therefore may not be transferable from one cluster to another."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the priority order for specifying an account name when submitting a job?",
    "answer": "The environment variable takes priority over the account name inside the job script. To override the environment variable, an account name must be supplied as a command-line argument to `sbatch`."
