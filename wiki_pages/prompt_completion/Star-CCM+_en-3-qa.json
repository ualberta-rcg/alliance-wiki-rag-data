    "question": "How are SSH tunnels established for STAR-CCM+ license access on the Trillium cluster?",
    "answer": "SSH tunnels are established using the command `ssh tri-gw -L $FLEXPORT:$LICSERVER:$FLEXPORT -L $VENDPORT:$LICSERVER:$VENDPORT -N -f`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the workaround for STAR-CCM+ license failures on the Trillium cluster?",
    "answer": "A workaround for license failures on Trillium involves attempting to start STAR-CCM+ up to 5 times in a loop, pausing for 5 seconds after the first attempt, until the exit status is 0."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the `NCORE` variable calculated in the Trillium Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The `NCORE` variable is calculated as the product of `SLURM_NNODES`, `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`, and `SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE` using the command `NCORE=$((SLURM_NNODES * SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK * SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE))`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What initial step is required to set up an account for remote visualization with STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "To set up an account for remote visualization, you must first create the `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file as described in the documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do users with a POD license configure their account for remote visualization?",
    "answer": "Users with a POD license should set the `LM_PROJECT` environment variable to their CD-ADAPCO PROJECT ID (e.g., `export LM_PROJECT='CD-ADAPCO PROJECT ID'`) and add the `-power` option to their STAR-CCM+ command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules should be loaded for remote visualization of STAR-CCM+ 15.04.010 or newer versions on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "For STAR-CCM+ 15.04.010 or newer on compute nodes, you should load `StdEnv/2020` and either `starccm-mixed/17.02.007` or `starccm/17.02.007-R8`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are necessary for running STAR-CCM+ versions 14.06.010, 14.04.013, or 14.02.012 for remote visualization on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "To run STAR-CCM+ versions 14.06.010, 14.04.013, or 14.02.012 on compute nodes for remote visualization, load `StdEnv/2016` and then either `starccm-mixed/14.06.010` or `starccm/14.06.010-R8`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I launch STAR-CCM+ 13.06.012 or older versions for remote visualization on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "For STAR-CCM+ 13.06.012 or older on compute nodes, load `StdEnv/2016`, followed by `starccm-mixed/13.06.012` or `starccm/13.06.012-R8`, and then execute `starccm+ -mesa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I connect to VDI nodes for remote visualization of STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "Connect to `gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca` using TigerVNC. After logging in, open a terminal window by navigating to `Applications -> Systems Tools -> Mate Terminal`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check available STAR-CCM+ versions on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "After loading a `StdEnv` module on VDI nodes, you can use the `module avail starccm-mixed` command to display the available STAR-CCM+ versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the limitation regarding OpenGL implementation for STAR-CCM+ on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "On `gra-vdi` with STAR-CCM+, currently only the MESA implementation of OpenGL is usable due to virtualgl issues that prevent local GPU hardware acceleration for OpenGL-driven graphics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to launch STAR-CCM+ 18.04.008 or newer versions on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "To launch STAR-CCM+ 18.04.008 or newer on VDI nodes, first load `CcEnv` and `StdEnv/2023`, then load `starccm-mixed/18.04.008` or `starccm/18.04.008-R8`, and finally run `starccm+ -rr server`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are required for STAR-CCM+ versions 15.04.010 to 18.02.008 on VDI nodes, and how is it launched?",
    "answer": "For STAR-CCM+ versions 15.04.010 to 18.02.008 on VDI nodes, load `CcEnv` and `StdEnv/2020`, then `starccm-mixed/15.04.010` or `starccm/15.04.010-R8`, and launch with `starccm+ -mesa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the procedure to start STAR-CCM+ 13.06.012 or older versions on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "To start STAR-CCM+ 13.06.012 or older on VDI nodes, load `CcEnv` and `StdEnv/2016`, then `starccm-mixed/13.06.012` or `starccm/13.06.012-R8`, and execute `starccm+ -mesa`."
