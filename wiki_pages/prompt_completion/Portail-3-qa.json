  {
    "question": "What information is provided at the top of a GPU task page?",
    "answer": "At the top of the GPU task page, you'll find the task's name, its number, your username, and its status."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user view the submission script for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The details of your submission script are displayed by clicking on 'Voir le script de la t\u00e2che'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the submission script always available for GPU tasks?",
    "answer": "No, if the task was launched in interactive mode, the submission script is not available."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find the working directory and submission command for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The working directory and submission command are accessible by clicking on 'Voir la commande de soumission'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is available in the scheduler section for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "This section is dedicated to scheduler information, and you can access your GPU account page by clicking on your account number."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Ressources' section for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'Ressources' section provides an initial overview of your task's resource utilization by allowing you to compare 'Allocated' and 'Used' columns for various listed parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'CPU' graph show for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'CPU' graph allows you to visualize the utilization of requested CPU cores over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can users customize the CPU cores displayed in the 'CPU' graph for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "Yes, on the right side of the graph, users can select or deselect different cores according to their needs."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the 'CPU' graph not available for GPU tasks?",
    "answer": "The 'CPU' graph is not available for very short tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'M\u00e9moire' (Memory) graph display for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'M\u00e9moire' graph allows you to visualize the time-based usage of the memory you requested for the CPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What parameters can be observed in the 'Process and threads' graph for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'Process and threads' graph allows you to observe various parameters related to processes and execution threads."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the file system graphs represent for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The file system graphs represent the utilization of the file system for the current task (not the entire node). The left graph shows IOPS, and the right graph illustrates the data transfer rate between the task and the file system over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the right file system graph help identify activity patterns for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The right file system graph, by illustrating the data transfer rate between the task and the file system over time, allows for the identification of periods of intense activity or low file system usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the main GPU graph illustrate?",
    "answer": "The GPU graph represents your utilization of the GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' indicate, and what is its ideal value?",
    "answer": "'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' indicates the percentage of time the GPU executes a warp in the last sampling window. Ideally, this value should be around 80%."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'SM occupancy' and what is its generally expected value?",
    "answer": "'SM occupancy' is defined as the ratio between the number of warps assigned to an SM and the maximum number of warps an SM can manage. A value around 50% is generally expected."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal value for the 'Tensor' parameter in GPU utilization, and why?",
    "answer": "The value for the 'Tensor' parameter should be as high as possible because your code should ideally exploit this part of the GPU, which is optimized for multidimensional matrix multiplications and convolutions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be observed regarding 'Floating Point' operations (FP64, FP32, FP16) in the GPU graph?",
    "answer": "For 'Floating Point' operations FP64, FP32, and FP16, you should observe significant activity on only one of these types, depending on the precision used by your code."
