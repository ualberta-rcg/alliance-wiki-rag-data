    "question": "How do I copy a file from my local computer to a remote cluster using SCP?",
    "answer": "To copy a file like `foo.txt` from your current local directory to the `$HOME/work` directory on a cluster like B\u00e9luga, use the command: `scp foo.txt username@beluga.alliancecan.ca:work/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I copy a file from a remote cluster's project space to my local computer using SCP?",
    "answer": "To copy a file like `output.dat` from your project space on a remote cluster (e.g., Cedar) to your local computer's current directory, use the command: `scp username@cedar.alliancecan.ca:projects/def-jdoe/username/results/output.dat .`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should SCP commands always be executed?",
    "answer": "SCP commands should always be executed on your local computer, regardless of whether you are transferring data to or from a remote cluster."

  {
    "question": "Does SCP support recursive transfers of directories and files?",
    "answer": "Yes, SCP supports the `-r` option for recursively transferring a set of directories and files."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to use `scp -r` to transfer data into the `/project` filesystem?",
    "answer": "No, it is recommended against using `scp -r` to transfer data into `/project` because it can turn off the setgid bit in created directories, potentially leading to 'Disk quota exceeded' errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I use SCP with a custom SSH key name?",
    "answer": "If you have a custom SSH key name (other than the defaults like `id_dsa` or `id_rsa`), you need to use the `-i` option with SCP and specify the path to your private key before the file paths, for example: `scp -i /path/to/key foo.txt username@beluga.alliancecan.ca:work/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default SSH key names recognized by SCP?",
    "answer": "The default SSH key names recognized by SCP are `id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, and `id_rsa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do before initiating any data transfer to prevent 'unable to read data' errors?",
    "answer": "Before initiating any transfer, ensure you can read all the contents of the directories you intend to transfer."

  {
    "question": "How can I list unreadable files on a Linux system before an SCP transfer?",
    "answer": "On a Linux system, you can list all items not readable to you in a directory using the command: `find <directory_name> ! -readable -ls`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are common reasons for 'Unable to write new data' errors during a data transfer?",
    "answer": "Common reasons for 'Unable to write new data' errors include insufficient storage usage (not enough space or files available) and lacking write permissions at the destination location."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I troubleshoot an 'Unable to write new data' error?",
    "answer": "To troubleshoot an 'Unable to write new data' error, double-check storage usage to ensure enough space and files are available, and verify filesystem permissions to confirm you have write permission at the location where you are trying to transfer new files."
