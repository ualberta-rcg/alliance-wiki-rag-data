    "question": "How do you copy a file from a remote cluster's project space to your local computer using SCP?",
    "answer": "You can use a command like `scp username@fir.alliancecan.ca:projects/def-jdoe/username/results/output.dat .` to copy a file from a remote cluster's project space to your local computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which computer should the SCP command always be executed?",
    "answer": "The `scp` command should always be executed on your local computer, not the remote cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to use `scp -r` to transfer data into the `/project` directory?",
    "answer": "No, it is recommended against using `scp -r` to transfer data into `/project` because it can turn off the setgid bit, potentially leading to 'Disk quota exceeded' errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify a custom SSH key when using SCP?",
    "answer": "If you chose a custom SSH key name, you need to use the `-i` option of `scp` and specify the path to your private key before the file paths, for example: `scp -i /path/to/key foo.txt username@rorqual.alliancecan.ca:work/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used on a Linux system to list unreadable items in a directory before a data transfer?",
    "answer": "On a Linux system, the command `find <directory_name> ! -readable -ls` lists all items not readable to you, which is useful before initiating a data transfer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be checked if you are unable to write new data during a transfer?",
    "answer": "You should double-check the storage usage to ensure enough space and files are available, and also verify filesystem permissions to confirm you have write permission at the destination."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might the reported size of data differ between clusters when transferring?",
    "answer": "The reported size might differ because some clusters report space usage based on compressed data, while others report the apparent size of files. This means 1 TB of compressed data on one cluster could appear as 2 TB on another."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you determine the apparent size of a dataset on a cluster?",
    "answer": "You can determine the apparent size of a dataset using the `du -b dataset` command. The `du dataset` command shows the size of the compressed data."
