    "question": "What is PyRETIS?",
    "answer": "PyRETIS is a Python library designed for rare event molecular simulations, specifically focusing on methods like transition interface sampling (TIS) and replica exchange transition interface sampling (RETIS)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can PyRETIS be installed?",
    "answer": "PyRETIS can be installed using pre-compiled Python Wheels available in the Wheelhouse, compatible with various Python versions, and ideally within a virtual Python environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Python versions are compatible with PyRETIS 2.5.0 as of July 2020?",
    "answer": "As of July 2020, PyRETIS 2.5.0 is compatible with Python versions 3.6 and 3.7."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the correct installation order for PyRETIS and its dependency MDTraj?",
    "answer": "According to the PyRETIS installation instructions, the dependency MDTraj must be installed *after* PyRETIS."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to create and activate a Python virtual environment for PyRETIS?",
    "answer": "First, load the desired Python module (e.g., `module load python/3.7`). Then, create the virtual environment using `virtualenv --no-download ~/env_PyRETIS`, and finally activate it with `source ~/env_PyRETIS/bin/activate`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you install PyRETIS and MDTraj within an activated virtual environment?",
    "answer": "After activating the virtual environment, run `pip install --no-index pyretis` to install PyRETIS, and then `pip install --no-index mdtraj` to install MDTraj."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you run PyRETIS from an activated virtual environment?",
    "answer": "To run PyRETIS, first activate the virtual environment using `source ~/env_PyRETIS/bin/activate`, then execute commands like `pyretisrun --help` or `pyretisrun --input INPUT.rst --log_file LOG_FILE.log`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is PyVisA and what does its GUI require?",
    "answer": "PyVisA is an analysis tool offered by PyRETIS, and its graphical user interface (GUI) requires PyQt5 to be executed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should modules be loaded to use PyVisA with a PyRETIS virtual environment?",
    "answer": "To use PyVisA, first load the Python and Qt modules (e.g., `$ module load python/3.7 qt/5.11.3`), and then activate the PyRETIS virtual environment (`$ source ~/env_PyRETIS/bin/activate`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find documentation for PyRETIS?",
    "answer": "The usage of PyRETIS is documented on the PyRETIS website at http://www.pyretis.org/ and in the group's published papers."
  },
  {
