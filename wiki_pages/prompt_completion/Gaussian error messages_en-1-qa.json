    "question": "How does a Gaussian job indicate normal termination?",
    "answer": "A Gaussian job normally terminates with a line stating 'Normal termination of Gaussian 16' (or similar version), along with job cpu time and elapsed time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are common reasons for a Gaussian job not terminating normally without an explicit error message?",
    "answer": "If a Gaussian job does not terminate normally and no error message is produced, it usually means that the disk quota was exceeded, the job exceeded the time requested from the scheduler, the job exceeded the memory requested, or the job produced too much data for the local disk on the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of output indicates an 'Erroneous write' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "An 'Erroneous write' error is indicated by lines such as 'Erroneous write. write 122880 instead of 4239360.' or 'Erroneous write. write -1 instead of 3648000. fd = 4 writwa: No space left on device' or 'Erroneous write during file extend. write -1 instead of 8192 Probably out of disk space.'"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical explanation for an 'Erroneous write' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "The 'Erroneous write' error typically occurs when the job has run out of disk space, which could be due to exceeding a quota, a physically full disk, or a network drive being unavailable."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an 'Erroneous write' error be fixed?",
    "answer": "To fix an 'Erroneous write' error, you should check your disk quota with 'quota' and delete unnecessary files, or consider using a smaller basis set if the job is too large for the current hardware."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the description of the 'Link 9999' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "The 'Link 9999' error is described by output lines like 'Error termination request processed by link 9999.' and 'Error termination via Lnk1e in /disc30/g98/l9999.exe.', often accompanied by optimization details showing non-converged parameters and 'Number of steps exceeded'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the common cause for a 'Link 9999' error?",
    "answer": "The most common cause for a 'Link 9999' error is that a Gaussian job terminated abnormally due to reasons internal to Gaussian, primarily a geometry optimization that has not converged."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the reasons why geometry optimizations fail to converge, leading to a 'Link 9999' error?",
    "answer": "Geometry optimizations usually fail to converge due to a poor initial starting structure, a poor starting force constants matrix (Hessian), issues with the coordinate system (e.g., collinear atoms in a z-matrix), or if the default optimization method is not suitable."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a 'Link 9999' error related to non-converged geometry optimization be fixed?",
    "answer": "To fix a 'Link 9999' error, you can provide a better starting structure (e.g., from a lower level of theory), restart optimization from the last step using 'geom=allcheck', or use 'opt=CalcFC'. If the Hessian is poor, use 'Opt=ReadFC', 'Opt=CalcFC', or 'Opt=CalcAll' in linked jobs. If the coordinate system is at fault, reformulate the z-matrix or use default redundant internal coordinates. Alternatively, change the optimization method to 'opt=ef' or 'opt=gdiis'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'angle Alpha is outside the valid range of 0 to 180' error mean?",
    "answer": "This error means the Gaussian job terminated abnormally because an angle 'x' in the z-matrix changed to a value outside the allowed range of 0 < x < 180 degrees."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'angle Alpha is outside the valid range of 0 to 180' error?",
    "answer": "This error typically occurs if there are large geometry changes in a molecule, especially one composed of interacting fragments."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'angle Alpha is outside the valid range of 0 to 180' error be fixed?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you should re-define the z-matrix or use a different coordinate system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'End of file reading basis center' error signify in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "The 'End of file reading basis center' error is an input error indicating that you attempted to read a general basis set but forgot to include the basis set in the input."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the 'End of file reading basis center' error resolved?",
    "answer": "You can resolve this error by putting in the basis set or by removing 'gen' from the route line and specifying an internal basis set."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the explanation for the 'Operation on file out of range' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error typically occurs when you try to retrieve information from the checkpoint file (e.g., with 'Opt=ReadFC', 'guess=read', or 'geom=allcheck/modify') that was not written to it, either because it was not calculated previously or because the earlier job ran out of disk space or time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'Operation on file out of range' error be fixed?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you need to re-calculate or manually type in the required information."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'End of file in GetChg' error indicate in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "The 'End of file in GetChg' error indicates an input error where the charge/multiplicity line is missing, or 'geom=allcheck' was forgotten when intending to read charge/multiplicity from the checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you fix the 'End of file in GetChg' error?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you need to either put the charge/multiplicity line into the input or add 'geom=allcheck' to the route section."
