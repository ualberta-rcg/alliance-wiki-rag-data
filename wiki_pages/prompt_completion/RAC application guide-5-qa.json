  },
  {
    "question": "How are compute requests handled if there is insufficient capacity?",
    "answer": "A scaling function is applied to compute requests to provide a means by which decisions on RAC allocations can be made in a context of insufficient capacity."

  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key elements considered under the 'Project Justification' criterion for RPP applications?",
