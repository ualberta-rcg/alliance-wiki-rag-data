  {
    "question": "What is Cell Ranger and what is its primary function?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines used to process Chromium single cell 3-RNA-seq output. Its primary function is to align reads, generate gene-cell matrices, and perform clustering and gene expression analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of Chromium Single Cell reagent kits does Cell Ranger support?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger versions 1.2 and later support libraries generated by the Chromium Single Cell 3i-v1 and v2 reagent kits. Versions 1.1 and earlier do not support v2 libraries."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main gene expression pipelines included in Cell Ranger?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger includes four main gene expression pipelines: cellranger mkfastq, cellranger count, cellranger aggr, and cellranger reanalyze."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of output formats does Cell Ranger produce?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger delivers output in standard BAM, MEX, CSV, HDF5, and HTML formats, augmented with cellular information."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of cellsnp-lite?",
    "answer": "cellsnp-lite is designed to pileup expressed alleles in single-cell or bulk RNA-seq data, primarily for applications such as donor deconvolution in multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq data (e.g., with vireo) and doublet detection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of sequencing data can cellsnp-lite be applied to?",
    "answer": "Besides RNA-seq data, cellsnp-lite can also be applied to DNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, for both bulk and single-cell analyses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Centrifuge?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge is a novel microbial classification engine for rapid, accurate, and sensitive taxonomic classification and quantification of species from high-throughput sequencing reads in metagenomic studies."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Centrifuge achieve high speed and sensitivity in classification?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge achieves high speed and sensitivity by using a novel indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized for metagenomic classification, and by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the memory requirements for Centrifuge's index?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge requires a relatively small index, typically 4.7 GB for all complete bacterial and viral genomes plus the human genome."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'cereal' in the context of C++ libraries?",
    "answer": "cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library that takes arbitrary data types and converts them into different representations like compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON, and vice versa."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key features of the cereal library?",
    "answer": "The cereal library is designed to be fast, light-weight, easy to extend, and has no external dependencies. It supports converting data types to compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON formats."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which specific version of Cell Ranger is listed in the document?",
    "answer": "The specific version of Cell Ranger listed in the document is 2.1.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions are available for the 'cereal' library?",
    "answer": "The available versions for the 'cereal' library are 1.3.0 and 1.3.2."
