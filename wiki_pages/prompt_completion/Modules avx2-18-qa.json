  {
    "question": "What is Cell Ranger?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines that process Chromium single cell 3-RNA-seq output to align reads, generate gene-cell matrices, and perform clustering and gene expression analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main gene expression pipelines included in Cell Ranger?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger includes four main gene expression pipelines: cellranger mkfastq, cellranger count, cellranger aggr, and cellranger reanalyze."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the cellranger mkfastq pipeline do?",
    "answer": "The cellranger mkfastq pipeline wraps Illumina's bcl2fastq to correctly demultiplex Chromium-prepared sequencing samples and convert barcode and read data to FASTQ files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of cellranger count?",
    "answer": "The cellranger count pipeline takes FASTQ files from cellranger mkfastq and performs alignment, filtering, and UMI counting."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does cellranger aggr work?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger aggr aggregates outputs from multiple runs of cellranger count, normalizing those runs to the same sequencing depth and then recomputing the gene-barcode matrices and analysis on the combined data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is cellranger reanalyze used for?",
    "answer": "The cellranger reanalyze pipeline takes gene-barcode matrices produced by cellranger count or cellranger aggr and reruns the dimensionality reduction, clustering, and gene expression algorithms using tunable parameter settings."
  },
  {
    "question": "What output formats does Cell Ranger provide?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger delivers output in standard BAM, MEX, CSV, HDF5, and HTML formats, augmented with cellular information."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which libraries are supported by Cell Ranger 1.2 and later?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger 1.2 and later support libraries generated by the Chromium Single Cell 3i-v1 and v2 reagent kits."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the version of Cell Ranger mentioned in the document?",
    "answer": "The version of Cell Ranger mentioned is 2.1.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage for Cell Ranger?",
    "answer": "The homepage for Cell Ranger is https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/overview/welcome."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is cellsnp-lite?",
    "answer": "cellsnp-lite is a computational tool designed to pileup expressed alleles in single-cell or bulk RNA-seq data, used for donor deconvolution and doublet detection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of data can cellsnp-lite be applied to?",
    "answer": "Besides RNA-seq data, cellsnp-lite can also be applied to DNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, in both bulk and single-cell formats."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the version of cellsnp-lite available?",
    "answer": "The version of cellsnp-lite available is 1.2.2."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more information about cellsnp-lite?",
    "answer": "More information about cellsnp-lite can be found on its homepage: https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/cellsnp-lite."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Centrifuge?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge is a novel microbial classification engine for rapid, accurate, and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species on desktop computers."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Centrifuge achieve high speed and sensitivity?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge uses a novel indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized for metagenomic classification, along with exact alignments of k-mers and a novel classification algorithm."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the versions of Centrifuge available?",
    "answer": "The available versions of Centrifuge are 1.0.4-beta and 1.0.4.2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the required index size for Centrifuge?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge requires a relatively small index (4.7 GB for all complete bacterial and viral genomes plus the human genome)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage for Centrifuge?",
    "answer": "The homepage for Centrifuge is https://github.com/infphilo/centrifuge."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is cereal in the context of C++ libraries?",
    "answer": "cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library that converts arbitrary data types into different representations like compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key features of the cereal library?",
    "answer": "cereal is designed to be fast, light-weight, and easy to extend, with no external dependencies, and can be bundled with other code or used standalone."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of cereal are listed?",
    "answer": "Versions 1.3.0 and 1.3.2 of cereal are listed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the homepage for the cereal library?",
    "answer": "The homepage for the cereal library is https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/."
