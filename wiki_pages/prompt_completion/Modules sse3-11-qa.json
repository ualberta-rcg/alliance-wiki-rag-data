    "question": "What is IMPUTE 5?",
    "answer": "IMPUTE 5 is a genotype imputation method capable of scaling to reference panels with millions of samples. It optimizes accuracy by using a custom subset of haplotypes for individual imputation and achieves fast, accurate, and memory-efficient imputation by selecting haplotypes using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT)."
