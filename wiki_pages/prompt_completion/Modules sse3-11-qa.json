    "question": "What is IMPUTE 5 and what are its key features?",
    "answer": "IMPUTE 5 is a genotype imputation method capable of scaling to reference panels with millions of samples. It optimizes accuracy by using a custom subset of haplotypes for individual imputation and achieves fast, accurate, and memory-efficient imputation by selecting haplotypes using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does IMPUTE5 compare in speed to other imputation methods?",
    "answer": "IMPUTE5 is up to 30 times faster than MINIMAC4 and up to 3 times faster than BEAGLE5.1."
