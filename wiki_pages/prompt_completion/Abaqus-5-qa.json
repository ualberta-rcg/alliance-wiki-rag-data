  {
    "question": "What factors influence Abaqus's memory allocation and scratch disk usage?",
    "answer": "The upper limit of memory allocated by Abaqus depends on the 'MEMORY' parameter and the amount of physical memory available on the machine. Actual memory and scratch disk usage depend on this upper limit and the memory required to minimize I/O."
  },
  {
    "question": "When does Abaqus's scratch disk usage become close to zero?",
    "answer": "Scratch disk usage will be close to zero if the memory upper limit is greater than the memory required to minimize I/O."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is Abaqus's scratch disk usage roughly proportional to the difference between estimated and upper memory limits?",
    "answer": "This occurs when the actual memory used is close to the previously mentioned memory limit, meaning the memory upper limit is less than the estimated 'MEMORY TO MINIMIZE I/O'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to get an accurate estimate of scratch disk space for Abaqus?",
    "answer": "No, an accurate estimate of the scratch disk space is not possible."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to run Abaqus in graphical mode on a cluster?",
    "answer": "First, connect to a compute node with TigerVNC (with a 3-hour salloc time limit). Then, open a new terminal, load the `StdEnv/2020` and `abaqus/2021` modules, and start the application with `abaqus cae -mesa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `salloc` time limit when connecting to a compute node for graphical Abaqus use?",
    "answer": "The `salloc` time limit is 3 hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run Abaqus interactively in a GUI desktop using the OnDemand system?",
    "answer": "Connect to `ondemand.sharcnet.ca` from your laptop browser, open a new terminal, load the `StdEnv/2020` and `abaqus/2021` modules, and then start the application in graphical mode with `abaqus cae`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Abaqus module version is currently being installed for the OnDemand system?",
    "answer": "A module for `abaqus/2025` is in the process of being installed and will appear as an option once ready."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the gra-vdi system still recommended for Abaqus graphical use?",
    "answer": "No, gra-vdi will be permanently shut down very soon, and users are advised to use the new OnDemand system instead."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required for Abaqus to start in GUI (cae) mode?",
    "answer": "There must be at least one free cae license available for Abaqus to start in GUI mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many free and reserved CAE licenses does the SHARCNET license have?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET license has 2 free and 2 reserved CAE licenses, totaling 4 licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What error messages occur if all Abaqus CAE licenses are in use?",
    "answer": "If all CAE licenses are in use, an error message such as 'No socket connection to license server manager' and 'FLEXnet Licensing error:-7,96' will occur when attempting to start Abaqus cae."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to check the current usage of Abaqus CAE licenses?",
    "answer": "You can check CAE license usage by running `abaqus licensing lmstat -c $ABAQUSLM_LICENSE_FILE -a | grep \"Users of cae\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When was the SHARCNET Abaqus license renewed and when does it expire?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET license has been renewed until January 17, 2026."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many free CAE and execute tokens does the SHARCNET license provide?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET license provides 2 free CAE tokens and 35 free execute tokens."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the usage limits for SHARCNET free Abaqus tokens per user and per group?",
    "answer": "Usage limits are 10 tokens per user and 15 tokens per group."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are dedicated tokens integrated with free token usage limits for groups using the SHARCNET license?",
    "answer": "For groups that have purchased dedicated tokens, the free token usage limits are added to their reservation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the free SHARCNET Abaqus tokens?",
    "answer": "The free tokens are mainly intended for testing and light usage before users decide whether or not to purchase dedicated tokens."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were the approximate costs for dedicated Abaqus compute and GUI tokens in 2021?",
    "answer": "In 2021, dedicated compute tokens cost approximately CAD$110 each, and GUI tokens cost approximately CAD$400 each."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which hardware can the SHARCNET Abaqus license be used?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET license can only be used on SHARCNET hardware, including gra-vdi (for graphical mode) and Graham or Dusky clusters (for compute batch jobs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are required to gain access to the SHARCNET Abaqus license?",
    "answer": "You must contact technical support, mention it's for SHARCNET systems, and include a copy/paste of the License Agreement statement with your full name and username."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do all users in a group need to individually agree to the SHARCNET Abaqus License Agreement?",
