    "question": "How does Abaqus determine its memory and scratch disk usage?",
    "answer": "Abaqus's actual memory usage and disk space for scratch data depend on the 'MEMORY' parameter, the physical memory available on the machine, and the 'MEMORY REQUIRED TO MINIMIZE I/O' (MRMIO). If the memory upper limit is greater than MRMIO, actual memory usage will be close to MRMIO and scratch disk usage close to zero. Otherwise, memory usage will be near the specified limit, and scratch disk usage will be roughly proportional to the difference between MRMIO and that limit. An accurate estimate of scratch disk space is not possible."

    "question": "How can Abaqus be run in graphical mode?",
    "answer": "Abaqus can be run interactively in graphical mode on a cluster or gra-vdi using VNC, or via the Ondemand system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to run Abaqus in graphical mode on a cluster?",
    "answer": "1. Connect to a compute node (with a 3hr salloc time limit) using TigerVNC. 2. Open a new terminal window and enter 'module load StdEnv/2020 abaqus/2021'. 3. Start the application with 'abaqus cae -mesa'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I run Abaqus interactively in a GUI desktop using Ondemand?",
    "answer": "1. Connect to 'ondemand.sharcnet.ca' from your laptop browser. 2. Open a new terminal window and enter 'module load StdEnv/2020 abaqus/2021'. 3. Start the application in graphical mode using 'abaqus cae'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is gra-vdi still recommended for running Abaqus graphically?",
    "answer": "No, gra-vdi will be permanently shut down soon, and users are advised to use the new Ondemand system instead."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary condition for Abaqus to start in GUI mode?",
    "answer": "There must be at least one free CAE license available."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CAE licenses does the SHARCNET license have?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET license has a total of 4 CAE licenses issued, with 2 free and 2 reserved licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if all Abaqus CAE licenses are in use when trying to start the application?",
    "answer": "If all CAE licenses are in use, Abaqus will fail to start, displaying a 'FLEXnet Licensing error:-7,96' and 'No socket connection to license server manager' message, indicating no available licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "When was the SHARCNET license renewed?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET license was renewed until January 17, 2026."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tokens are provided by the SHARCNET license and what are the usage limits?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET license provides 2 CAE tokens and 35 execute tokens. Usage limits are 10 tokens per user and 15 tokens per group. For groups with dedicated tokens, these free token limits are added to their reservation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the approximate costs for dedicated Abaqus tokens?",
    "answer": "In 2021, dedicated compute tokens were approximately CAD$110 each, and GUI tokens were approximately CAD$400 each. Users should submit a ticket for an official quote."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which hardware can the SHARCNET license be used on?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET license can only be used on SHARCNET hardware, including gra-vdi (for graphical mode) and Graham or Dusky clusters (for compute batch jobs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are required to gain access to the SHARCNET Abaqus license?",
    "answer": "Users must contact technical support and request access. The email should mention it's for SHARCNET systems and include a copy/paste of the 'License Agreement' statement with the user's full name and username. Every user, including PIs, must do this individually."
