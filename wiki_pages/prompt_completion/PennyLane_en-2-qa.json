    "question": "What quantum operations are defined within the `bell_circuit` function in the example?",
    "answer": "The `bell_circuit` function defines a Hadamard gate on wire 0 (`qml.Hadamard(wires=0)`) and a CNOT gate on wires 0 and 1 (`qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which PennyLane device is configured for the quantum circuit simulator in the example?",
    "answer": "The `default.qubit` device with 2 wires is configured as the quantum circuit simulator (`dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=2)`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the `generate_bell_state` function defined as a QNode?",
    "answer": "The `generate_bell_state` function is defined as a QNode using the `@qml.qnode(dev)` decorator."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the first Bell state generated and displayed in the provided code snippet?",
    "answer": "The first Bell state is generated by calling `generate_bell_state()` and then displayed using `print(\"First Bell State :\", bell_state_0)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the output value for the 'First Bell State' as shown in the example?",
