  {
    "question": "What is the OpenCV library specialized in?",
    "answer": "The OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) library is specialized in real-time image processing."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is OpenCV available with CUDA support?",
    "answer": "Yes, OpenCV is also available with CUDA."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load OpenCV with CUDA?",
    "answer": "You can load it using the command `module load gcc cuda opencv/X.Y.Z`, replacing `X.Y.Z` with the desired version."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the OpenCV module include additional `contrib` modules?",
    "answer": "Yes, the module contains the `contrib` modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the OpenCV module provide Python interfaces?",
    "answer": "Yes, the module contains interfaces for several versions of Python."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you find out which Python interfaces are compatible with your version of OpenCV?",
    "answer": "You can launch `module spider opencv/X.Y.Z` or search directly for `opencv_python` with `module spider opencv_python/X.Y.Z`, substituting `X.Y.Z` with the chosen version."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to use OpenCV with Python?",
    "answer": "First, load the required modules using `module load gcc opencv/X.Y.Z python scipy-stack`. Then, import OpenCV by running `python -c \"import cv2\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you confirm a successful OpenCV import in Python?",
    "answer": "The importation is successful if nothing is displayed after running `python -c \"import cv2\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which OpenCV Python packages are available through the module?",
    "answer": "The module offers `opencv_python`, `opencv_contrib_python`, `opencv_python_headless`, and `opencv_contrib_python_headless`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the dependency on OpenCV satisfied for Python packages?",
    "answer": "The dependency on OpenCV is satisfied when the `opencv` module is loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you enable OpenCV to read EXR files?",
    "answer": "To enable OpenCV to read EXR files, the module must be activated via an environment variable using the command `OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR=1 python <file>`."
