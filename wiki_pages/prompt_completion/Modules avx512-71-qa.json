  {
    "question": "What is Minimap2?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 is a fast sequence mapping and alignment program designed to find overlaps between long noisy reads, or to map long reads or their assemblies to a reference genome."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the capabilities of Minimap2?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 can find overlaps between long noisy reads, or map long reads or their assemblies to a reference genome, optionally with detailed alignment (CIGAR). It works efficiently with query sequences from a few kilobases to ~100 megabases in length at an error rate ~15%."
  },
  {
    "question": "What output formats does Minimap2 support?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 outputs in the PAF or the SAM format."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Minimap2's speed compare to other long-read aligners?",
    "answer": "On limited test data sets, Minimap2 is over 20 times faster than most other long-read aligners."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the intended replacement for BWA-MEM for long reads and contig alignment?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 will replace BWA-MEM for long reads and contig alignment."
