    "question": "How do I launch AnsysEDT in graphical mode on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "After loading the required modules, type `ansysedt` in the terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I configure AnsysEDT after launching it on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Click on `Tools -> Options -> HPC and Analysis Options -> Edit`, then uncheck \"Use Automatic Settings\" (once only). Do not modify Cores, as it is detected by Slurm."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I start an interactive analysis in AnsysEDT on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Click on `Project -> Analyze All`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum duration for Ansys programs on Graham VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Ansys programs can be executed for up to 7 days on Graham VDI nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the maximum resources (cores, memory) available for Ansys programs on Graham VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Programs can use a maximum of 8 cores (up to 16 cores) and 128GB of memory on Graham VDI nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of using the VDI system for Ansys programs?",
    "answer": "The VDI system provides OpenGL GPU acceleration, which is ideal for high-performance graphics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some common uses for VDI with Ansys?",
    "answer": "VDI can be used for creating or modifying simulation input files, post-processing data, or visualizing simulation results."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I connect to Graham VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Connect with TigerVNC to `gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I load Ansys modules on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Open a terminal window and load `SnEnv` followed by an AnsysEDT module (e.g., `ansysedt/2023R2`) or an Ansys module (e.g., `ansys/2024R2[.04]` or `ansys/2025R1[.02]`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I launch AnsysEDT graphically after loading modules on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "In the terminal, enter `ansysedt` and wait for the graphical interface to appear."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum size for a parallel task on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "The maximum size for a parallel task executed on gra-vdi must be limited to 16 cores to avoid overloading servers and impacting other users."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I run two simultaneous Ansys tasks on Graham VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Use two distinct VNC sessions; connect the first to `gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca` and the second to `gra-vdi4.sharecnet.ca`. Start Ansys in graphical mode in each session."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is important to note when running simultaneous Ansys simulations on VDI nodes regarding directories?",
    "answer": "Simulations running simultaneously should generally be executed in different directories to avoid file conflicts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there time limits for running simulations on gra-vdi nodes?",
    "answer": "Unlike VNC connections on compute nodes, there is no time limit constraint on gra-vdi for running simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I configure the HPC License type in AnsysEDT on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Once in the graphical interface, click `Tools -> Options -> HPC and Analysis Options -> Options`, then change `HPC License` to **Pool** (which allows using more than 4 cores), and click `OK`. This only needs to be done once."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I copy the 2023R2 Antennas example directory for AnsysEDT?",
    "answer": "Connect to a cluster (e.g., graham), load `ansysedt/2023R2`, then execute: `mkdir -p ~/Ansoft/$EBVERSIONANSYSEDT; cd ~/Ansoft/$EBVERSIONANSYSEDT; rm -rf Antennas; cp -a $EBROOTANSYSEDT/v232/Linux64/Examples/HFSS/Antennas ~/Ansoft/$EBVERSIONANSYSEDT`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I execute an example simulation file in AnsysEDT?",
    "answer": "Open an .aedt simulation file, click `HFSS -> Validation Check`, and then click `Project -> Analyze All` to run the simulation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if validation errors occur when running an AnsysEDT example simulation?",
    "answer": "If validation errors occur, close and re-open the simulation as many times as necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I quit AnsysEDT without saving changes?",
    "answer": "Click on `File -> Close -> No`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps can I take if AnsysEDT crashes and won't restart?",
    "answer": "Try running `pkill -9 -u $USER -f \"ansys*|mono|mwrpcss|apip-standalone-service\"` and then `rm -rf ~/.mw` (AnsysEDT will then reuse the initial configuration)."
