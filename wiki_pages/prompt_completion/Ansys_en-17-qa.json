  {
    "question": "How do you start Fluent, CFX5, or ICEMCFD on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "After loading the necessary modules (e.g., `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys/2024R2.04`), run `unset SESSION_MANAGER` and then execute `fluent`, `cfx5`, or `icemcfd`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `unset SESSION_MANAGER` prevent when starting Fluent on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "`unset SESSION_MANAGER` prevents the Qt message \"Qt: Session management error: None of the authentication protocols specified are supported\" from appearing when starting Fluent."
