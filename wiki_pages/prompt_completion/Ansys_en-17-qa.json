  {
    "question": "How do I load the necessary modules to run Ansys Fluids programs like Fluent, CFX5, or ICEMCFD on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You need to load `CcEnv` and `StdEnv/2023` along with an Ansys module like `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command should I use to start Fluent, CFX5, or ICEMCFD from the command line on VDI nodes after loading the modules?",
    "answer": "You should use `unset SESSION_MANAGER` followed by `fluent`, `cfx5`, or `icemcfd`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Qt: Session management error' message when starting Fluent on VDI nodes and how can it be prevented?",
    "answer": "The message 'Qt: Session management error: None of the authentication protocols specified are supported' is prevented by unsetting the `SESSION_MANAGER` variable."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I encounter an 'Error segmentation violation' pop-up when starting ICEMCFD on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Do not click the 'OK' button in the pop-up. Instead, go to the Settings Tab, then Display, tick X11, click Apply, then OK, and finally File -> Exit. The error should not appear on subsequent restarts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are required to run Ansys Mapdl on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You need to load `CcEnv`, `StdEnv/2023`, and an Ansys module like `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I start the MAPDL GUI directly on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You can start the MAPDL GUI directly by typing `mapdl -g` in the terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the alternative method to start MAPDL via the launcher on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "The alternative is to use `unset SESSION_MANAGER; launcher -> click RUN button`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the module requirements for running Ansys Workbench with `SnEnv` on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You need to load `SnEnv` and an Ansys module like `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are necessary to run Ansys Workbench using `CcEnv` on VDI nodes for newer Ansys versions?",
    "answer": "You should load `CcEnv`, `StdEnv/2023`, and an Ansys module such as `ansys/2025R1` (or newer versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between `runwb2` and `runwb2-gui` when using locally installed Ansys modules with `SnEnv`?",
    "answer": "`runwb2` uses the SHARCNET license server by default. `runwb2-gui` reads your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file and offers an interactive option to use the CMC server."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve the 'Software rasterizer found, hardware acceleration will be disabled' warning when starting Fluent from within Workbench on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You can resolve this by either clicking the Environment tab in the Fluent Launcher panel and copying `HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` into the input box before starting Fluent, or by setting `export HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` in your environment before starting Workbench."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended core and memory limits for running Mechanical in Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "When running Mechanical in Workbench on gra-vdi, you should tick 'Distributed' in the Solver panel and specify a maximum of 24 cores, while not exceeding 128GB of memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended core and memory limits for running Fluent in Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "When running Fluent in Workbench on gra-vdi, you should untick 'Distributed' and specify a maximum of 12 cores, while not exceeding 128GB of memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I am only doing pre-processing or post-processing work with Ansys on gra-vdi and not running calculations, how many cores should I use?",
    "answer": "You should only use 4 cores to avoid checking out HPC licenses unnecessarily."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can I use to terminate rogue Ansys processes if Workbench or other Ansys programs freeze or do not start properly on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "You can run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|fluent|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE|mono\"` in a new terminal window."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if problems with Ansys persist after killing rogue processes, especially if I've been working on compute nodes before gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Try running `rm -rf .ansys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations of using the `ansys/2025R1` module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "The `ansys/2025R1` module is not usable with the SHARCNET license server until an upgrade expected in early August 2025. It's only available under `CcEnv`, not `SnEnv`, and the GUI for some programs like Ansys Mechanical do not work properly and will not be fixed as gra-vdi is to be retired soon."
