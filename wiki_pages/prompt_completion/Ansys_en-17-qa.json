    "question": "How do you start Ansys Fluent, CFX, or ICEM CFD in GUI mode on a VDI node?",
    "answer": "First, load the necessary modules using `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions). Then, unset the session manager with `unset SESSION_MANAGER` and run `fluent`, `cfx5`, or `icemcfd`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to avoid the 'Qt: Session management error' when starting Fluent on a VDI node?",
    "answer": "Run `unset SESSION_MANAGER` before starting Fluent to prevent this message."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you resolve the 'Error segmentation violation' pop-up when starting ICEM CFD on a VDI node?",
    "answer": "When the pop-up appears, do not click OK. Instead, go to the Settings Tab, click Display, tick X11, click Apply, then OK, and finally File -> Exit. This is a one-time fix."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch Ansys MAPDL directly in GUI mode on a VDI node?",
    "answer": "Load the modules `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions), then execute `mapdl -g`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch Ansys MAPDL using the launcher GUI on a VDI node?",
    "answer": "After loading the `CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older) modules, run `unset SESSION_MANAGER; launcher` and then click the RUN button in the launcher."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are used to start Ansys Workbench with SnEnv on VDI for versions 2024R2.04 or older?",
    "answer": "Use `module load SnEnv` followed by `module load ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which command starts Workbench with the SHARCNET license server by default when using SnEnv?",
    "answer": "The `runwb2` command will use the SHARCNET license server by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you specify a remote license server (like CMC) when starting Workbench with SnEnv on VDI?",
    "answer": "Start Workbench with `runwb2-gui`. This script reads your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file and offers an interactive option to use the CMC server."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are used to start Ansys Workbench with CcEnv on VDI for Ansys 2025R1 or newer?",
    "answer": "Load modules with `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `module load ansys/2025R1` (or newer versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you prevent the 'Software rasterizer found' warning when starting Fluent from Workbench (version 2025R1) on a VDI node?",
    "answer": "Before clicking start in the Fluent Launcher panel, click the Environment tab and copy/paste `HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` into the empty input box. Alternatively, set `export HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` in your environment before starting Workbench."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended core settings for running Ansys Mechanical in Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Tick 'Distributed' in the Solver panel and specify a maximum value of 24 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended core settings for running Ansys Fluent in Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Untick 'Distributed' and specify a maximum value of 12 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum memory limit for Ansys simulations in Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Do not exceed 128GB of memory; exceeding this limit will cause Ansys to be killed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many cores should be used for pre-processing or post-processing work with Ansys on gra-vdi when not running calculations?",
    "answer": "Only use 4 cores to avoid checking out unnecessary HPC licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to terminate frozen or misbehaving Ansys processes on a VDI node?",
    "answer": "Open a new terminal window on gra-vdi and run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|fluent|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE|mono\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What troubleshooting step should be attempted if Ansys GUI issues persist on gra-vdi after previously working on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Try running `rm -rf .ansys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is Ansys 2025R1 not currently usable with the SHARCNET license server on gra-vdi?",
