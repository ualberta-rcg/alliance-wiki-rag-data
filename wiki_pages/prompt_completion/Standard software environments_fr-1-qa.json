    "question": "Where can I find more information about migrating to standard environments?",
    "answer": "You can find more information on the \"Migration vers le nouvel environnement standard\" page."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are software environments made available?",
    "answer": "Software environments are made available by a set of modules that allow users to switch between different versions of a software package."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are these modules organized?",
    "answer": "These modules are organized in a tree structure, with the trunk consisting of utilities found in Linux environments, and main branches for compiler versions with sub-branches for MPI or CUDA versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What constitutes a standard software environment?",
    "answer": "A standard software environment is composed of a specific combination of compiler modules and MPI modules, grouped into a module called `StdEnv`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who typically uses these standard environments?",
    "answer": "These environments are commonly used by the technical team to build other software."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were the four versions of standard environments available as of February 2023?",
    "answer": "As of February 2023, the four versions of standard environments were 2023, 2020, 2018.3, and 2016.4."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of the standard environments are currently supported?",
    "answer": "Only versions 2023 and 2020 are currently supported."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it recommended to install the most recent standard environment?",
    "answer": "The most recent versions of software packages are usually installed in the most recent standard environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default components of the `StdEnv/2023` environment?",
    "answer": "The `StdEnv/2023` environment uses GCC 12.3.0, Intel 2023.1, and Open MPI 4.1.5 by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I activate the `StdEnv/2023` environment?",
    "answer": "To activate the `StdEnv/2023` environment, launch the command `module load StdEnv/2023`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimal CPU instruction set supported by `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "The minimal CPU instruction set supported by `StdEnv/2023` is AVX2, generally `x86-64-v3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default compiler in `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "The default compiler in `StdEnv/2023` is GCC, rather than Intel."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are applications compiled with Intel in `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "Applications are compiled with Intel only if they demonstrate better performance with Intel in `StdEnv/2023`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is CUDA handled in the `StdEnv/2023` environment?",
    "answer": "In `StdEnv/2023`, CUDA becomes an extension of OpenMPI; MPI for CUDA is loaded at launch if CUDA is loaded. This allows sharing multiple MPI libraries across all branches (CUDA or not)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What default module versions were updated in `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "The default module versions updated in `StdEnv/2023` are GCC from 9.3 to 12.3, OpenMPI from 4.0.3 to 4.1.5, Intel Compilers from 2020 to 2023, Intel MKL from 2020 to Flexiblas 3.3.1 (with MKL 2023 or BLIS 0.9.0), and CUDA from 11 to 12."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is `StdEnv/2020` still supported on new systems?",
    "answer": "`StdEnv/2020` is no longer supported on new systems; however, CPU-only software will function without issues."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did `StdEnv/2020` become the default environment?",
    "answer": "`StdEnv/2020` became the default environment in April 2021."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were the default compilers and MPI for `StdEnv/2020`?",
    "answer": "For `StdEnv/2020`, the default compilers were GCC 9.3.0 and Intel 2020.1, and the default MPI was Open MPI 4.0.3."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I activate the `StdEnv/2020` environment?",
    "answer": "You can activate the `StdEnv/2020` environment with the command `module load StdEnv/2020`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What performance improvement do Intel compiler-generated binaries offer in `StdEnv/2020`?",
    "answer": "In `StdEnv/2020`, Intel compiler-generated binaries automatically support AVX2 and AVX512 instruction sets, functioning as multi-architecture or \"fat binaries\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of \"fat binaries\" when using clusters like Cedar or Graham with `StdEnv/2020`?",
    "answer": "When using Intel compiler-generated software packages with \"fat binaries\" on clusters like Cedar or Graham which have multiple generations of processors, users no longer need to manually load an `arch` module."
  },
  {
    "question": "How has the module hierarchy changed for some software packages like R and bioinformatics in `StdEnv/2020`?",
    "answer": "In `StdEnv/2020`, some software packages, such as R and bioinformatics packages, are now at a lower level of the hierarchy, making the same module visible regardless of the loaded compiler, where previously the `gcc` module often had to be loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What enabled the change in module hierarchy for certain packages in `StdEnv/2020`?",
    "answer": "This change was made possible by CPU-specific optimizations performed below the compiler level."
