  {
    "question": "What is OpenFOAM?",
    "answer": "OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation and Manipulation) CFD Toolbox is a free, open-source software package for computational fluid dynamics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of problems can OpenFOAM solve?",
    "answer": "OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to solid dynamics and electromagnetics."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the most recent version of OpenFOAM?",
    "answer": "To load the recent version of OpenFOAM, you should run the command `module load openfoam`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who are the key contributors to the OpenFOAM development community?",
    "answer": "The OpenFOAM development community consists of The OpenFOAM Foundation Ltd. (with websites openfoam.org and cfd.direct) and OpenCFD Ltd. (with website openfoam.com)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are OpenFOAM module names differentiated after version 2.3.1 based on their development branch?",
    "answer": "After version 2.3.1, module names beginning with 'v' (e.g., `openfoam/v1706`) are derived from the .com branch, while those beginning with a digit (e.g., `openfoam/4.1`) are derived from the .org branch."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find documentation for OpenFOAM?",
    "answer": "Users can find documentation on OpenFOAM.com and the CFD Direct user guide."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is necessary before running OpenFOAM commands?",
    "answer": "Before running OpenFOAM commands (such as `paraFoam` or `blockMesh`), you must load a module file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a serial submission script for OpenFOAM typically include?",
    "answer": "A serial submission script for OpenFOAM typically includes Slurm directives like `--time` and `--account`, followed by commands such as `module purge`, `module load openfoam/12`, `blockMesh`, and `icoFoam`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Slurm directives and commands are included in a typical parallel submission script for OpenFOAM?",
    "answer": "A typical parallel submission script for OpenFOAM includes Slurm directives like `--account`, `--ntasks`, `--mem-per-cpu`, and `--time`, followed by commands such as `module purge`, `module load openfoam/12`, `blockMesh`, `setFields`, `decomposePar`, and `srun interFoam -parallel`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should mesh preparation or solver execution be run as a Slurm job?",
    "answer": "Mesh preparation (`blockMesh`) may be done at the command line if it's fast. However, the solver (e.g., `icoFoam`) is usually the most expensive step and should always be submitted as a Slurm job, except for very small test cases or tutorials."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the petscFoam solver?",
    "answer": "The petscFoam solver is an external solver that OpenFOAM can be compiled with, although it is not included in the standard OpenFOAM modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the petscFoam solver included in the standard OpenFOAM modules?",
    "answer": "No, our OpenFOAM modules do not include the petscFoam solver, but it can be compiled on our clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a prerequisite for compiling OpenFOAM with the external petscFoam solver?",
    "answer": "The versions of OpenFOAM and PETSc need to be compatible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you give examples of compatible OpenFOAM and PETSc version combinations?",
    "answer": "Compatible combinations include `openfoam/v2412` with `petsc/3.21.6` and `openfoam/v2312` with `petsc/3.20.0`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check which minor release of PETSc is compatible with a particular OpenFOAM version?",
    "answer": "To check compatible PETSc versions, load the desired OpenFOAM module (e.g., `openfoam/v2412`) and then run `grep \"^petsc_version\" $EBROOTOPENFOAM/OpenFOAM*/etc/config.sh/petsc`."
  },
  {
    "question": "If `openfoam/v2412` was tested with PETSc 3.21.2, why is `petsc/3.21.6` still considered compatible?",
    "answer": "The `petsc/3.21.6` module is considered compatible because it is from the same 3.21 release branch and is expected to contain only bugfixes compared to 3.21.2."
