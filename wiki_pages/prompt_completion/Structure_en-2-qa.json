    "question": "Where can users find an example for running StrAuto jobs on HPC clusters using the Slurm Workload manager?",
    "answer": "An example for running StrAuto jobs on HPC clusters using the Slurm Workload manager is outlined in chapter 8 of the StrAuto User Guide."
  },
  {
    "question": "When do StrAuto jobs perform best regarding allocated CPUs?",
    "answer": "StrAuto jobs work best when the total number of Structure runs is a multiple of the number of requested tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can happen if the number of Structure runs is not a multiple of the requested tasks?",
    "answer": "If the number of Structure runs is not a multiple of the requested tasks, some allocated CPUs may sit idle, leading to a significant waste of computing resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is important for the maximum job time when running multiple Structure runs?",
    "answer": "The requested maximum job time needs to be sufficiently large to accommodate multiple subsequent Structure runs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might jobs with long walltimes experience longer wait times for dispatch?",
    "answer": "Jobs with long walltimes typically have to wait longer until they are dispatched due to job scheduling policies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for individual Structure runs that take more than a few hours to complete?",
    "answer": "In cases where an individual Structure run takes more than just a few hours to finish, it is recommended to submit each Structure run as an individual job to Slurm."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` script?",
    "answer": "The `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` script is designed to help run Structure jobs on Compute Canada HPC clusters that use the Slurm Workload manager, especially for sets of longer Structure runs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What software packages are required to use `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py`?",
    "answer": "The `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` script requires Structure, StrAuto, and StructureHarvester."
  },
  {
    "question": "What files must be placed in the directory alongside `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` before use?",
    "answer": "Users must place `strauto_1.py` and `input.py` from StrAuto, `structureHarvester.py` and `harvesterCore.py` from StructureHarvester, and the Structure dataset file (e.g., `my_dataset.str`) in the same directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you make the `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` script executable?",
    "answer": "To make `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` executable, run the command `chmod u+x create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What files should be present in the directory after making `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` executable and listing them?",
    "answer": "After making the script executable, the directory should contain: `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py*`, `harvesterCore.py`, `input.py`, `my_dataset.str`, `strauto_1.py*`, and `structureHarvester.py*`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which file's settings need to be edited as described in the StrAuto User Manual?",
    "answer": "The settings in the `input.py` file need to be edited as described in the StrAuto User Manual."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific option in `input.py` must be set for parallel execution?",
    "answer": "The `parallel` option in `input.py` must be set to `True` (question 23)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What parameters within the `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` script itself should be adjusted?",
    "answer": "The parameters `max_jobtime`, `slurm_account`, and `submit_delay` (and optionally `job_prefix`) in `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` should be adjusted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of setting `max_jobtime` in `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py`?",
    "answer": "`max_jobtime` should be set to a duration that ensures no individual Structure run takes longer than this specified time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is `slurm_account` used in `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py`?",
    "answer": "`slurm_account` can be used to specify under which Slurm account to submit jobs, especially when a user has access to multiple accounts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is `submit_delay` used in the submission helper script?",
    "answer": "The `submit_delay` parameter is used to pause for a defined time between each job submission, helping to avoid overloading the scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are run after setting up the files and editing `input.py`?",
    "answer": "First, load the Python module with `module load python/2.7`, then run `./strauto_1.py`, followed by `./create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What output is generated when running `./create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py`?",
    "answer": "Running `./create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` creates SLURM job scripts, necessary directories, a submission helper script named `submit_strauto_jobs.sh`, and a post-processing script named `post_strauto.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the generated Slurm jobs submitted?",
    "answer": "The generated Slurm jobs are submitted by executing the helper script: `bash submit_strauto_jobs.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command should be run after all submitted jobs have completed?",
    "answer": "After all jobs have completed, run `bash post_strauto.sh` to aggregate the results and run StructureHarvester."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the license under which the `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` program is distributed?",
    "answer": "The `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` program is licensed under the conditions of the 'MIT License'."
