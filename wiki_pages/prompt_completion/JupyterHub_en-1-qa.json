  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "JupyterHub is designed to serve Jupyter Notebook for multiple users, making it suitable for groups like students in a class, corporate data science teams, or scientific research groups."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of Jupyter does JupyterHub typically provide?",
    "answer": "JupyterHub typically provides a preconfigured version of JupyterLab and/or Jupyter Notebook."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what types of tasks are Jupyter Lab and notebooks recommended?",
    "answer": "Jupyter Lab and notebooks are meant for short, interactive tasks such as testing, debugging, or quickly visualizing data, typically lasting only a few minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should longer analysis tasks be performed instead of using interactive Jupyter notebooks?",
    "answer": "Running longer analysis tasks must be done in a non-interactive job, typically submitted using `sbatch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Alliance clusters support JupyterHub access?",
    "answer": "JupyterHub can be accessed on the B\u00e9luga, Fir, Narval, and Rorqual clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do users authenticate to JupyterHub on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "Users connect to JupyterHub on Alliance clusters using their Alliance username and password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a significant limitation of the compute nodes running Jupyter kernels on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "The compute nodes running the Jupyter kernels do not have internet access."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the implications of Jupyter compute nodes not having internet access?",
    "answer": "Users can only transfer files from/to their own computer; they cannot download code or data from the internet (e.g., 'git clone', 'pip install' if the wheel is absent, or code performing downloads/uploads)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which organizations collaborate to offer cloud-based JupyterHubs to universities and schools?",
    "answer": "The Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences, in collaboration with the Alliance and Cybera, offers cloud-based hubs to universities and schools."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the cloud-based JupyterHubs offered to universities and schools?",
    "answer": "These hubs are essentially for training purposes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can institutions interested in obtaining their own cloud-based JupyterHub visit for more information?",
    "answer": "Institutions interested in obtaining their own hub can visit syzygy.ca."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after a user logs into JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "After logging in, the user's web browser is redirected to either a previously launched Jupyter server, a new Jupyter server with default options, or a form allowing the user to set different options for their server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is accessing resources via JupyterHub equivalent to?",
    "answer": "Accessing requested resources via JupyterHub is equivalent to accessing them via an interactive job on the corresponding cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the consequence if a user already has another interactive job running on the cluster when trying to start a Jupyter session?",
    "answer": "If a user already has another interactive job running on the cluster hosting JupyterHub, their new Jupyter session may never start before the 5-minute time limit, as only one interactive job gets a priority increase at a time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What server options are available on B\u00e9luga's JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "Server options on B\u00e9luga's JupyterHub include choosing an Account, specifying Time (hours) for the session, Number of (CPU) cores, Memory (MB) limit, optional GPU configuration, and the User interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many Jupyter servers can a user utilize at a time on each hub?",
    "answer": "JupyterHub allows each user to use one Jupyter server at a time on each hub."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the available user interface options within JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "The available user interface options are JupyterLab (modern interface), Jupyter Notebook (classic interface), and Terminal (for a single terminal only)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Jupyter user interface is most recommended for interactive prototyping and data visualization?",
    "answer": "JupyterLab is the most recommended Jupyter user interface for interactive prototyping and data visualization."
  },
  {
    "question": "What functionality does the Terminal user interface provide in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "The Terminal user interface gives access to a terminal connected to a remote account, comparable to connecting to a server through an SSH connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What typically causes 'Spawn failed: Timeout' errors in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "Most 'Spawn failed: Timeout' errors are caused by the underlying job scheduler being unresponsive or unable to find appropriate resources for the session, or if the job does not start within five minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can cause a longer wait time for a JupyterHub session to start?",
    "answer": "A longer requested time, requesting a GPU, or too many CPU cores can cause a longer wait time for a JupyterHub session."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if they encounter a 'Spawn failed: Timeout' error?",
    "answer": "Users should request only the resources they need, stop or cancel any other interactive jobs on the same cluster, and check the status page or try again later if no resources are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does an 'Authentication error: Error 403' usually indicate?",
    "answer": "An 'Authentication error: Error 403' typically indicates that the user's account or their access to the cluster is currently inactive."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user resolve an 'Authentication error: Error 403'?",
    "answer": "To resolve an 'Authentication error: Error 403', users should ensure their account is active (renewed) and that their access to the specific cluster is enabled."
