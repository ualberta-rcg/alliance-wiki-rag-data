  },
  {
    "question": "What credentials are needed to connect to JupyterHub on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "Users need their Alliance username and password to connect to JupyterHub on the specified clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the JupyterHubs on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and Rorqual provide access to?",
    "answer": "They provide access to JupyterLab servers that are spawned through jobs on their respective clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do the compute nodes running Jupyter kernels have internet access?",
    "answer": "No, the compute nodes running the Jupyter kernels do not have internet access."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations of not having internet access on Jupyter kernel compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Users can only transfer files from/to their own computer; they cannot download code or data from the internet (e.g., 'git clone', 'pip install' if the wheel is absent), and code performing downloads or uploads may encounter problems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which organizations offer cloud-based JupyterHubs to universities and schools?",
    "answer": "The Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences, in collaboration with the Alliance and Cybera, offers cloud-based hubs to universities and schools."
  },

    "answer": "Users authenticate with their credentials from their respective institution."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are these institutional JupyterHubs hosted and for what primary purpose?",
    "answer": "The hubs are hosted on Alliance clouds and are essentially for training purposes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can institutions get their own cloud-based JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "Institutions interested in obtaining their own hub can visit Syzygy (syzygy.ca)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the possible browser redirections after logging into JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "After logging in, the browser can redirect to a previously launched Jupyter server, a new Jupyter server with default options, or a form to set different options for the Jupyter server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of job is accessing resources via JupyterHub equivalent to?",
    "answer": "It is equivalent to accessing requested resources via an interactive job on the corresponding cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a limit to how many interactive jobs receive priority on a cluster?",
    "answer": "Yes, on each cluster, only one interactive job at a time gets a priority increase."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a user has another interactive job running while trying to start a Jupyter session?",
    "answer": "If a user already has another interactive job running on the same cluster, their new Jupyter session may never start before the time limit of 5 minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some server options available on B\u00e9luga's JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "Server options include selecting an Account, specifying Time (hours), Number of (CPU) cores, Memory (MB) limit, and optionally, GPU configuration."
