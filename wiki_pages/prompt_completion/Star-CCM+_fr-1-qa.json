    "question": "What is STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "STAR-CCM+ is a simulation software suite used in various engineering specialties."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which engineering domains can STAR-CCM+ be used for modeling?",
    "answer": "It allows modeling in fields such as acoustics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, rheology, multiphase flow, particle flow, solid mechanics, reactive fluids, electrochemistry, and electromagnetism."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do users need to provide their own license for STAR-CCM+ on the servers?",
    "answer": "Yes, users must possess their own license because STAR-CCM+ binaries are installed on the servers but there is no general-use license."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the ways to obtain a STAR-CCM+ license?",
    "answer": "Users can purchase a Power On Demand (POD) license directly from Siemens or use a local license hosted by their institution, provided the firewall allows access to the cluster where tasks will be executed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure the `$HOME/.licenses/starccm.lic` file for an institutional license server?",
    "answer": "Create the file with the content `SERVER <server> ANY <port>` followed by `USE_SERVER`, replacing `<server>` with the hostname or IP and `<port>` with the static port of the license server provider."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it necessary to manually set the `CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable for STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "No, it is not necessary to define `CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE` manually in your Slurm script; it is automatically specified from `$HOME/.licenses/starccm.lic` when a Star-CCM+ module is loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What configuration is required for a Siemens POD license in a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "For a Siemens POD license, the `LM_PROJECT` environment variable must be manually configured as your CD-ADAPCO PROJECT ID in your Slurm script, and the `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file must also be configured."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial steps for submitting batch jobs on a cluster using an institutional license server?",
    "answer": "First, create the `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file, then submit a technical support request to coordinate the necessary network firewall modifications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What troubleshooting step is suggested if licensing problems persist with STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "If license problems persist, try deleting or renaming the `~/.flexlmrc` file, as it might store previous search paths or license server settings."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can accumulated STAR-CCM+ output files consuming disk quota be removed?",
    "answer": "Hidden directories named `.star-version_number` can accumulate and consume quota; they can be periodically removed by running `rm -ri ~/.starccm*` and answering 'yes' to the prompt."
