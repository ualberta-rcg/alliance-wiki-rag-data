  },
  {
    "question": "How is the Keras package installed within R?",
    "answer": "In R, install the Keras package with `devtools::install_github('rstudio/keras')`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should `install_keras()` be called in R after Keras and TensorFlow are installed via pip in a virtual environment?",
    "answer": "No, you should not call `install_keras()` in R if Keras and TensorFlow have already been installed in your virtual environment with `pip`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you use the Keras package in R after the virtual environment has been activated?",
    "answer": "After activating the environment, enter `library(keras)` and `use_virtualenv(Sys.getenv('VIRTUAL_ENV'))` in R."
