    "question": "What is the purpose of the Stacks software pipeline?",
    "answer": "Stacks is a software pipeline designed for building loci from short-read sequences, such as those generated on the Illumina platform. It is used for building genetic maps and conducting population genomics and phylogeography, particularly with restriction enzyme-based data like RAD-seq."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of Stacks are available?",
    "answer": "Available versions for Stacks include 2.53, 2.55, 2.57, 2.59, 2.60, 2.62, 2.64, 2.66, and 2.67."

  {
    "question": "What is STAR software used for?",
    "answer": "STAR is an alignment program used to align RNA-seq reads to a reference genome. It achieves this using uncompressed suffix arrays."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the available versions for the STAR aligner?",
    "answer": "The available versions for the STAR aligner are 2.7.5a, 2.7.8a, 2.7.9a, 2.7.11a, and 2.7.11b."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage for the STAR alignment program?",
    "answer": "The homepage for the STAR alignment program is https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is STAR-Fusion?",
    "answer": "STAR-Fusion is a tool that uses the STAR aligner to identify candidate fusion transcripts supported by Illumina reads. It then processes the output to map junction reads and spanning reads to a reference annotation set."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of STAR-Fusion is available?",
    "answer": "Version 1.10.0 of STAR-Fusion is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "STAR-CCM+ is an all-in-one software solution for multidisciplinary engineering simulations, including complex fluid flows, chemical reactions, turbulence, heat transfer, solid dynamics, and electromagnetics."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of starccm are listed with double precision?",
    "answer": "Starccm versions listed with double precision include 15.04.010-R8, 16.02.008-R8, 16.02.009-R8, 16.04.007-R8, 16.04.012-R8, 16.06.008-R8, 17.02.007-R8, 17.02.008-R8, 17.04.007-R8, 17.04.008-R8, 17.06.007-R8, 17.06.008-R8, 18.02.008-R8, 18.04.008-R8, 18.04.009-R8, 18.06.006-R8, 18.06.007-R8, 19.04.007-R8, 19.04.009-R8, 19.06.009-R8, 20.02.008-R8, and 20.04.007-R8."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between starccm and starccm-mixed?",
    "answer": "Both starccm and starccm-mixed are STAR-CCM+ simulation tools, but starccm uses double precision, while starccm-mixed uses mixed precision for its calculations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find the homepage for STAR-Fusion?",
    "answer": "The homepage for STAR-Fusion is https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion."
