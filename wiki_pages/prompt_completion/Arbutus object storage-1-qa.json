    "question": "What is object storage?",
    "answer": "Object storage is a service that manages data as objects, differing from other storage architectures that use a file hierarchy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can objects in object storage be edited in place?",
    "answer": "No, objects in object storage cannot be edited in place; they can only be created, replaced, or deleted."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why has object storage become popular?",
    "answer": "Object storage has become popular due to its ability to handle large files and large numbers of files, and the prevalence of compatible tools."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a unit of data, or object, managed in object storage?",
    "answer": "A unit of data or object is managed as a whole, and the information within it cannot be modified in place."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are objects stored in an object store?",
    "answer": "Objects are stored in containers within the object store."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the best use cases for object storage?",
    "answer": "Object storage is best used for storing and exporting items that do not require hierarchical naming, are accessed mostly as a whole and read-only, and have simplified access-control rules."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much object storage is allocated by default to Arbutus projects?",
    "answer": "All Arbutus projects are allocated a default 1TB of object storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can Arbutus projects request more object storage beyond the default 1TB, up to 10TB?",
    "answer": "An additional 9TB can be requested through the Rapid Access Service if more than the default 1TB is required."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can Arbutus projects request more than 10TB of object storage?",
    "answer": "More than 10TB of object storage must be requested and allocated under the annual Resource Allocation Competition."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is object storage managed for Arbutus projects?",
    "answer": "Management of an Arbutus project's object storage containers is self-service."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the Arbutus object store backed up automatically?",
    "answer": "No, the object store itself is not backed up, and operations like backups of containers are self-service."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which protocols are available for accessing the OpenStack Object Store on Arbutus?",
    "answer": "Access to the OpenStack Object Store on Arbutus is offered via two protocols: Swift or Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can object storage containers and objects created with one protocol (Swift or S3) be accessed by the other?",
    "answer": "Yes, object storage containers and objects created with Swift or S3 can be accessed using both protocols."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which object storage protocol is the default on Arbutus, and what is an advantage of it?",
    "answer": "Swift is the default protocol and is simpler because users do not have to manage credentials themselves."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is access governed when using Swift for object storage on Arbutus?",
    "answer": "Access when using Swift is governed using your Arbutus account."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a user wants to manage object storage containers using access policies, which protocol must they use?",
    "answer": "Users must use S3 to manage object storage containers with access policies, as Swift does not support them."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a benefit of using S3 for object storage on Arbutus?",
    "answer": "With S3, users can create and manage their own keys, which is useful for things like creating read-only user accounts for specific applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to manage your Arbutus Object Store?",
    "answer": "To manage your Arbutus Object Store, you will need your own storage access ID and secret key."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you generate storage access ID and secret key for your Arbutus Object Store?",
    "answer": "You can generate storage access ID and secret key by using the OpenStack command line client and running `openstack ec2 credentials create`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can access policies for Arbutus Object Store be set using a web browser?",
    "answer": "No, setting access policies cannot be done via a web browser; it requires a SWIFT or S3-compatible client."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the different ways to access data containers in the Arbutus Object Store?",
    "answer": "Data containers can be accessed using an S3-compatible client (e.g., s3cmd), Globus, or via a browser using an HTTPS endpoint if policies are public."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what condition can a web browser be used to access Arbutus object storage, and what is the endpoint format?",
    "answer": "A web browser can be used if object storage policies are set to public (not default), via an HTTPS endpoint like `https://object-arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca:443/DATA_CONTAINER/FILENAME`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended tool for managing buckets and objects in the Arbutus Object Store?",
    "answer": "The recommended tool for managing buckets and objects in the Arbutus Object Store is the `s3cmd` tool, which is available in Linux."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the Arbutus OpenStack Dashboard be used to manage object storage?",
    "answer": "Yes, certain management tasks for object storage can be performed using the 'Containers' section under the 'Object Store' tab in the Arbutus OpenStack Dashboard."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are 'data containers' also known as in other object storage systems?",
    "answer": "In other object storage systems, 'data containers' are also known as 'buckets'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What management tasks can be performed using the Arbutus OpenStack Dashboard for object storage?",
    "answer": "Using the dashboard, users can create new data containers, upload files, and create directories."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can data containers be created using S3-compatible clients as an alternative to the dashboard?",
    "answer": "Yes, data containers can also be created using S3-compatible clients."
