    "question": "What does the error message 'End of file in GetChg' in Gaussian indicate?",
    "answer": "This error means that the charge/multiplicity line was omitted in the input, or `geom=allcheck` was not specified when attempting to read charge/multiplicity from a checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I fix the 'End of file in GetChg' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "To resolve this error, you should either provide the charge/multiplicity line in the input or add `geom=allcheck` to the route section if you intended to use it from a checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Change in point group or standard orientation' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error typically occurs when the standard orientation or the point group of the molecule changes during the optimization process. A visualization program might show a sudden 180-degree flip of the structure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the solutions for a 'Change in point group or standard orientation' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "Solutions include redefining the Z-matrix if transitioning from a point group to a subgroup, decreasing the symmetry of the starting structure if it is too high, reformulating the Z-matrix with more symmetry if the point group is incorrect or symmetry is too high, or disabling symmetry if it is not critical."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the reason for an 'Unrecognized atomic symbol' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error happens when an atom specified in a general basis (like 'ic2' in the example) does not correspond to a standard atomic symbol. It can also occur in a linked task if default coordinates were used, erasing the Z-matrix, and then `geom=modify` is attempted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you resolve the 'Unrecognized atomic symbol' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "The solution is to enter the correct atomic symbol."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Convergence failure -- run terminated' mean in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error indicates that the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) procedure failed to converge."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the common solutions for a 'Convergence failure -- run terminated' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "Solutions include obtaining a better `guess=read` (e.g., from a lower theoretical level SCF like HF/STO-3G), using a different convergence procedure such as `SCF=QC` or `SCF=XQC`, modifying the initial geometry if there's a weakness in bond lengths, or resubmitting the job using the penultimate (or an earlier) geometry and a new evaluation of the Hessian matrix."
