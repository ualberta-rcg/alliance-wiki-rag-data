    "question": "What resources are associated with `system-compute` subsystems in clusters?",
    "answer": "`system-compute` subsystems (e.g., `rorqual-compute`) are associated with CPU resources, and users must precisely indicate their memory requirements as they will be considered in the allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What resources are associated with `system-gpu` subsystems in clusters?",
    "answer": "`system-gpu` subsystems (e.g., `rorqual-gpu`) are associated with GPU resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What resources are associated with `system-storage` subsystems in clusters?",
    "answer": "`system-storage` subsystems (e.g., `rorqual-storage`) are associated with storage resources, and the lists only show the available resources such as `/project` and `/nearline` within each subsystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should a user request both CPU and `/project` storage resources on the Rorqual cluster?",
    "answer": "The user must fill out two distinct requests: one for core-years and memory with the `rorqual-compute` subsystem, and another for `/project` storage space in TB with the `rorqual-storage` subsystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the procedure for requesting cloud resources from different sites?",
    "answer": "If you need cloud resources from different sites, you must submit a separate request for each site."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are cloud resources typically presented or categorized?",
    "answer": "Cloud resources are presented according to conventions like `system-compute-cloud` or `system-persistent-cloud`."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which cloud systems can users select both compute and persistent instances?",
    "answer": "In the Arbutus, Fir, and B\u00e9luga clouds, users can select compute or persistent instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which cloud system only allows the selection of persistent instances?",
    "answer": "In the Nibi cloud, only persistent instances can be selected."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of information is displayed in the lists for cloud resource selection?",
    "answer": "The lists for cloud resources only show the available OpenStack 'flavors' for each cloud."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted for questions about requesting resources?",
    "answer": "For questions about how to request resources, you should write to `allocations@tech.alliancecan.ca`."
