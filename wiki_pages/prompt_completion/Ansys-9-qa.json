  {
    "question": "What module versions are specified for Ansys Fluent jobs using the multinode restart script?",
    "answer": "The script specifies loading `StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2023R2` (or newer versions) for Beluga, Cedar, Graham, and Narval clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What variables need to be customized in the Ansys Fluent multinode restart script?",
    "answer": "You need to customize `MYVERSION` (e.g., '2d', '2ddp', '3d', '3ddp'), `MYJOUFILE` (your initial journal filename), `MYJOUFILERES` (your journal restart filename), `MYCASFILERES` (your case restart filename), and `MYDATFILERES` (your data restart filename)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the total number of cores (`NCORES`) calculated in the Ansys Fluent multinode restart script?",
    "answer": "The total number of cores (`NCORES`) is calculated as the product of `SLURM_NNODES`, `SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE`, and `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to generate the machine file for Ansys Fluent multinode jobs in the restart script?",
    "answer": "The command `slurm_hl2hl.py --format ANSYS-FLUENT > /tmp/machinefile-$SLURM_JOB_ID` is used to generate the machine file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Fluent multinode restart script handle single-node versus multi-node execution?",
    "answer": "For single-node execution (`SLURM_NNODES == 1`), Fluent is run with `-pshmem`. For multi-node execution, it uses `-pib` and specifies the machine file with `-cnf=/tmp/machinefile-$SLURM_JOB_ID`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Ansys Fluent restart script differentiate between an initial run and a subsequent restart?",
    "answer": "The script checks the `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`. If `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` is 1, it uses `MYJOUFILE` for the initial run. Otherwise, it uses `MYJOUFILERES` for restarts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after a successful completion of a Fluent job within the restart script?",
    "answer": "If the job completes successfully (`$? -eq 0`), and it's not the last task in the array (`SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID -lt SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT`), it links the most recent output `.cas` and `.dat` files to the restart filenames (`MYCASFILERES`, `MYDATFILERES`) to prepare for the next restart. If it's the last task, it prints 'Job completed successfully! Exiting now.' and calls `scancel` on the job ID."
  },
  {
    "question": "What actions are taken if a Fluent simulation fails in the restart script?",
    "answer": "If the simulation fails, the script prints 'Simulation failed. Exiting \u2026'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What older Ansys and StdEnv module versions are explicitly mentioned as no longer supported or older in the script?",
    "answer": "The script comments indicate that `StdEnv/2020` is 'no longer supported' and `ansys/2019R3` (narval only) and `ansys/2021R2` (beluga, cedar, graham) are 'older versions'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific configurations are applied if the cluster is 'narval' and `EBVERSIONGENTOO` is 2020 in the Fluent restart script?",
    "answer": "If the cluster is 'narval' and `EBVERSIONGENTOO` is 2020, the script loads `intel/2021 intelmpi`, sets `INTELMPI_ROOT=$I_MPI_ROOT/mpi/latest`, sets `HCOLL_RCACHE=^ucs`, and unsets `I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP_EXEC_EXTRA_ARGS` and `I_MPI_ROOT`."
