  {
    "question": "What is Weights & Biases (wandb)?",
    "answer": "Weights & Biases (wandb) is a meta machine learning platform designed to help AI practitioners and teams build reliable machine learning models for real-world applications by streamlining the machine learning model lifecycle."
  },
  {
    "question": "What functionalities does wandb provide?",
    "answer": "By using wandb, you can track, compare, explain, and reproduce machine learning experiments."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the general requirements for full wandb usage on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Full usage of wandb on compute nodes requires internet access as well as access to Google Cloud Storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Alliance clusters have limited wandb availability?",
    "answer": "Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA have limited wandb availability."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can use wandb on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA, and how?",
    "answer": "Users from MILA and other eligible groups only can use wandb on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA via `httpproxy`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Alliance clusters fully support wandb without requiring `httpproxy`?",
    "answer": "Fir, Nibi, Vulcan, and Killarney fully support wandb without requiring `httpproxy`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Alliance cluster does not support wandb and why?",
    "answer": "Trillium does not support wandb because internet access is disabled on its compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What special conditions apply to MILA members using wandb on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "Members of the MILA Qu\u00e9bec AI Institute may use wandb on any clusters with internet access, provided they use a valid 'Mila-org' Weights & Biases account to log in."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can other groups bypass Google Cloud Storage API calls for wandb?",
    "answer": "Yes, other groups may have made arrangements with Weights & Biases to bypass calls to the Google Cloud Storage API. Users should contact their PI to confirm if such arrangements exist for their group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does wandb crash or freeze on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA?",
    "answer": "The wandb package automatically attempts to upload environment information to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, which is not allowed on the compute nodes of these clusters. Uploading artifacts with `wandb.save()` also requires Google Cloud Storage access, leading to crashes or freezes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to disable the behavior that causes wandb to crash on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA?",
    "answer": "No, it is not currently possible to disable this behavior."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users still utilize wandb on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA despite the limitations?",
    "answer": "Users can still use wandb on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA by enabling `offline` mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the functionality of wandb's `offline` mode?",
    "answer": "In `offline` mode, wandb writes all metrics, logs, and artifacts to the local disk and does not attempt to sync anything to the Weights&Biases service on the internet."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you sync wandb content to the online service after a run in `offline` mode?",
    "answer": "After your jobs finish running in offline mode, you can sync their wandb content to the online service by running the command `wandb sync` on the login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there an alternative to Weights & Biases that works on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA?",
    "answer": "Yes, Comet.ml is a product very similar to Weights & Biases, and it works on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA."
  },
  {
    "question": "What module needs to be loaded for running wandb in online mode on applicable clusters?",
    "answer": "To run wandb in online mode on applicable clusters, the `httpproxy` module must be loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended number of CPUs for an SBATCH job that uses wandb?",
    "answer": "At least two CPUs per task are recommended: one for the main process and one for the wandb process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you install wandb in a virtual environment without internet access?",
    "answer": "You can install wandb using `pip install --no-index wandb` within a virtual environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you log in to wandb with an API key for online mode?",
    "answer": "You can save your wandb API key in your `.bash_profile` or replace `$API_KEY` with your actual key and then uncomment `wandb login $API_KEY`, while commenting out `wandb offline`."
