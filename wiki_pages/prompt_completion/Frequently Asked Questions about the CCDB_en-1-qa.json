  {
    "question": "What is a 'role' in the context of Alliance computational resources?",
    "answer": "A role is an identifier representing a person's position (e.g., faculty, graduate student), institution, and sponsor. A valid and up-to-date role is necessary to access computational resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if their institution, sponsor, or position changes regarding their CCDB role?",
    "answer": "If your institution, sponsor, or position changes, you need to apply for a new role rather than updating the old one, to maintain accurate records for governmental funding agencies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the format of a CCRI?",
    "answer": "A CCRI follows the convention CCI <dash> 2 digits. For example, for a user with CCI abc-123, a first role's CCRI would be abc-123-01."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a CCRI?",
    "answer": "A CCRI is the unique identifier for your role. A single CCI can be linked to more than one CCRI over time, and every job run on a national cluster is attributed to a CCRI."

  {
    "question": "What is a Resource Allocation Project (RAP)?",
    "answer": "RAPs provide PIs access to national computational resources. Each RAP has a unique RAPI and an associated group name. RAPs represent groups of researchers to whom computing resources are allocated."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are computing resources allocated to RAPs instead of individuals?",
    "answer": "Computing resources are allocated to RAPs (groups of researchers), not individuals, because the word 'project' is too ambiguous for reporting purposes, and to provide statistics on how facilities are used."
  },
  {

    "answer": "The two main types of RAPs are Default RAPs and RAC RAPs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Default RAP?",
    "answer": "A Default RAP is automatically created when a PI role is activated. It manages storage and cloud quotas for default and Rapid Access Service, allowing PIs and sponsored users opportunistic use of compute resources with the lowest priority. Its CCDB convention is 'def-profname'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a RAC RAP?",
    "answer": "A RAC RAP is created when a PI receives an award through the Resource Allocation Competition (RAC) application process. Its RAPI typically takes the form 'abc-123-ab', with group names varying based on allocation type (e.g., 'rrg-profname-xx' for HPC, 'crg-profname-xx' for Cloud)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a group name in the context of Resource Allocation Projects?",
    "answer": "A group name is an alias for the Research Allocation Project Identifier (RAPI). It has a unique one-to-one mapping with a RAPI and is often easier for users to remember."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical group name convention for a Default RAP?",
    "answer": "The typical group name convention for a Default RAP is 'def-[profname][-xx]'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical group name conventions for HPC resource RAPs?",
    "answer": "For HPC resource RAPs, the typical group name conventions are 'rrg-[profname][-xx]' for RRG/HPC and 'rpp-[profname][-xx]' for RPP/HPC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical group name conventions for Cloud resource RAPs?",
    "answer": "For Cloud resource RAPs, the typical group name conventions are 'crg-[profname][-xx]' for RRG/Cloud and 'cpp-[profname][-xx]' for RPP/Cloud."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a group name used within the system?",
    "answer": "The group name is used as a POSIX group name with an associated POSIX group ID and is propagated through LDAP in the dn attribute, for example: 'dn: cn=rpp-profname,ou=Group,dc=computecanada,dc=ca'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who has access to a Default RAP?",
    "answer": "All of a PI's activated sponsored user roles are always members of the PI's default RAP. This membership cannot be modified, though a PI can deactivate any role they sponsor."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does membership work for a RAC RAP with HPC resources?",
    "answer": "For RAC RAPs with HPC resources, CCDB automatically adds all of the PI's sponsored user roles, all associated Co-PI roles, and all sponsored users roles of all associated Co-PIs. Any new role sponsored by the PI after RAP creation is also automatically added."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does membership work for a RAC RAP with Cloud resources?",
    "answer": "For RAC RAPs with Cloud resources allocated, only the PI is added as a member at the time of creation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a PI modify membership for a RAC RAP?",
    "answer": "Yes, the PI can modify the membership of any of their RAC RAPs at any time. Any user with an active Alliance account can be added as a member of a RAC RAP."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three RAP membership permission levels?",
    "answer": "There are three RAP membership permission levels: Owner, Manager, and Member."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the permissions of a RAP 'Owner'?",
    "answer": "The PI is the sole owner of the RAP and all associated allocations. This cannot be changed. The owner can add or remove RAP managers and members."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the permissions and limitations of a RAP 'Manager'?",
    "answer": "A Manager has elevated permission (on CCDB only) delegated by the owner or another manager to make membership changes. Managers can use the PI's allocation, but cannot make changes on the project/nearline file systems (e.g., change ownership, apply ACLs, manage permissions on Globus) on behalf of the PIs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the permissions of a RAP 'Member'?",
    "answer": "Members can use the PI\u2019s allocation in the corresponding cluster(s) but cannot make any modifications to the RAP membership."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is RAP membership represented and used in the system?",
    "answer": "RAP membership is represented as a group in LDAP, defining a group of users authorized to submit jobs against the RAPI (ID of the RAP) and share files within the same Unix group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I sign up for a new Alliance account if I had one in the past but my position or sponsor changed, or I lost my password?",
    "answer": "No, each person can only have one Alliance account (one CCI). Duplicate CCI requests are refused. If your position or sponsor changed, you should apply for a new role with your existing account. If you lost your password, you can reset it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I have an existing CCI but my position or sponsor has changed?",
