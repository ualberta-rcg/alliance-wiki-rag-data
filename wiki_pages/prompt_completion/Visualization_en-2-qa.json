    "question": "How do I connect to Niagara for X11-forwarding?",
    "answer": "You need to ssh into niagara.scinet.utoronto.ca using the `-X` or `-Y` flag for X11-forwarding."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to perform an interactive visualization session on Niagara using X11-forwarding?",
    "answer": "First, ssh into niagara.scinet.utoronto.ca with the `-X/-Y` flag. Then, request an interactive job by running `debugjob`. Once connected to a node, load your visualization module (e.g., `module load vmd`) and run your application (e.g., `vmd`), then exit the debug session."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should remote off-screen windows via Xvfb be used?",
    "answer": "Xvfb should be used when applications insist on displaying graphical output, but you do not actually need to see them because the results are saved to a file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run an application for off-screen rendering using Xvfb with CPU rendering?",
    "answer": "You can run the application with `xvfb-run <name-of-application>` in a job script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run an application for off-screen rendering using Xvfb with GPU rendering?",
    "answer": "You can run the application with `xvfb-run vglrun -d egl <name-of-application>` in a job script. This requires reserving one GPU with Slurm."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to benchmark when using Xvfb for GPU rendering?",
    "answer": "It's important to benchmark because, depending on the workload, the GPU may not necessarily be faster than the CPU, and GPUs are typically more expensive resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is VNC recommended over X11-forwarding for starting graphical user interfaces like Matlab?",
    "answer": "X11-forwarding can result in a very slow connection to the server for GUIs, so VNC is recommended for starting and connecting to a remote desktop."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more information about starting a remote desktop via VNC?",
    "answer": "More information can be found in the article on VNC."
