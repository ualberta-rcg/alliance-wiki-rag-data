  {
    "question": "When is it useful to use remote off-screen windows via Xvfb?",
    "answer": "It is useful when applications insist on displaying graphical output, but you don't need to see them because the results are saved in a file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you run an application for off-screen CPU rendering using Xvfb?",
    "answer": "Run the application in a job script using `xvfb-run <name-of-application>`."

  {
    "question": "How do you enable off-screen GPU rendering for an application using Xvfb?",
    "answer": "Use `xvfb-run vglrun -d egl <name-of-application>` and ensure you reserve a GPU with Slurm."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to benchmark CPU vs GPU when using Xvfb for rendering?",
    "answer": "It is important to benchmark because the GPU may not necessarily be faster than the CPU, depending on the workload, before committing to the more expensive GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is VNC recommended over X11-forwarding for starting graphical user interfaces like Matlab?",
    "answer": "X11-forwarding can result in a very slow connection, so VNC is recommended to start and connect to a remote desktop instead."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more information about VNC?",
    "answer": "More information about VNC can be found in the article on VNC, linked as `[[VNC|the article on VNC]]`."
