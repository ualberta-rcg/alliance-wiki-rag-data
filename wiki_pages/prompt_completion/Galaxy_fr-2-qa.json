  {
    "question": "Why might you need to adjust the `job_conf.xml` file?",
    "answer": "You might need to adjust the content of the <tt>job_conf.xml</tt> file to optimize memory allocation and real-time execution limits, which is essential for proper tool function and preventing failures due to lack of resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done to determine the appropriate memory and real-time execution for tools?",
    "answer": "You should perform tests to determine the appropriate amount of memory and real-time execution for each tool."
