    "question": "What is NextDenovo?",
    "answer": "NextDenovo is a string graph-based de novo assembler designed for long reads (CLR, HiFi, and ONT). It uses a \"correct-then-assemble\" strategy similar to canu, but without a correction step for PacBio HiFi reads, requiring significantly fewer computing resources and storage."
  },
