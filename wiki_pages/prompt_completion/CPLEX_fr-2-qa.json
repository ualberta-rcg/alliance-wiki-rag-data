    "question": "What variables need to be adjusted in the CPLEX module file?",
    "answer": "The `cplexversion` and `studio_root` variables need to be adjusted in the CPLEX module file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What values should be set for `cplexversion` and `studio_root` in the module file?",
    "answer": "`cplexversion` should be set to the downloaded version, and `studio_root` to the software's access path (the path specified during archive extraction)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What additional steps are required if you are using Java with CPLEX?",
    "answer": "If using Java, you need to add `export CLASSPATH=.` to your `.bashrc` file and modify the dynamic CPLEX library by copying it and running `setrpaths.sh --path libcplex1280.so`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure your Java code is found during execution when using CPLEX?",
    "answer": "You can add the line `export CLASSPATH=.` to your `.bashrc` file to allow your Java code to be found during execution."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you modify the dynamic CPLEX library for Java applications?",
    "answer": "You need to find the dynamic library in the installation directory, make a copy, and then execute the command `setrpaths.sh --path libcplex1280.so`."

  {
    "question": "What should be done if a memory error occurs during CPLEX compilation?",
    "answer": "If a memory error occurs during compilation, you should request an interactive compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you request an interactive compute node to resolve a memory error during CPLEX compilation?",
    "answer": "You can use a command like `salloc --time=1:0:0 --ntasks=1 --mem-per-cpu=8G` to request an interactive compute node."

  {
    "question": "What is the initial step to use CPLEX with Python after installation?",
    "answer": "The first step to use CPLEX with Python after installation is to load CPLEX using `module load mycplex/<version>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are CPLEX packages like `docplex` recommended to be installed for Python?",
    "answer": "It is suggested to install CPLEX packages like `docplex` from a virtual environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the process for installing CPLEX Python libraries within an activated virtual environment?",
    "answer": "Once the virtual environment is activated, you should go to the `$STUDIO_ROOT/python` directory and then run `python setup.py install` to install the library."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which type of node should CPLEX Python packages be installed and why?",
    "answer": "CPLEX Python packages must be installed on the head node because they are not available on the software stack."
