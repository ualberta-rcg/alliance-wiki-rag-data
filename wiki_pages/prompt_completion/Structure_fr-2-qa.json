    "answer": "Structure Harvester is a website and program for visualizing STRUCTURE output and implementing the Evanno method."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who authored the 2011 publication for Structure Harvester?",
    "answer": "Dent A. Earl and Bridgett M. vonHoldt authored the 2011 publication for Structure Harvester."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of tools like StrAuto and StructureHarvester?",
    "answer": "They are used to automate the preparation of multiple processes and the aggregation of results for population structure analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can an example of StrAuto tasks executed on HPC clusters with Slurm be found?",
    "answer": "An example can be found in Chapter 8 of the StrAuto user manual."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what condition does the StrAuto example for Slurm-scheduled tasks perform best?",
    "answer": "It performs best when the total number of processes is a multiple of the number of requested cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the total number of processes is not a multiple of the requested cores for StrAuto tasks?",
    "answer": "Some allocated CPUs will not be utilized while the last 'structure' processes are running, which is not an optimal use of computing resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an important consideration for the requested execution time when running multiple 'structure' processes?",
    "answer": "The requested execution time must be sufficient to account for the multiple 'structure' processes that will follow."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` script?",
    "answer": "It is designed to help execute Slurm-scheduled Structure tasks on Compute Canada HPC clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tools are required to use the `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` script?",
    "answer": "The required tools are Structure, StrAuto, and StructureHarvester."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` be initially set up in a directory?",
    "answer": "Place the script `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` in a directory along with `strauto_1.py`, `input.py` (from StrAuto), `structureHarvester.py`, `harvesterCore.py` (from StructureHarvester), and your data file (e.g., `my_dataset.str`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you make the `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` script executable?",
    "answer": "Make it executable using the command `chmod u+x create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a crucial configuration step for `input.py` when using StrAuto for parallel execution?",
    "answer": "You must set the option `parallel = True` (question 23) as described in the StrAuto user manual."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which parameters in the `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` script should be adjusted?",
    "answer": "The `max_jobtime`, `slurm_account`, and `submit_delay` parameters should be adjusted (around lines 65-70)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `max_jobtime` parameter define in `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py`?",
    "answer": "`max_jobtime` defines a minimum duration for the execution of a single 'structure' process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is `slurm_account` used in the `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` script?",
    "answer": "`slurm_account` is used to specify the Slurm account under which to submit the task."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of configuring `submit_delay` in `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py`?",
    "answer": "`submit_delay` is configured to define a pause between job submissions, helping to avoid overloading the scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial commands to execute after configuring the StrAuto and Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "First, load the Python module with `module load python/2.7`, then run `./strauto_1.py`, and finally `./create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What output indicates that `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` has successfully created job scripts and helper files?",
    "answer": "The output will show 'Creating SLURM job scripts...created [number] job scripts.', 'Creating directories...done!', 'Creating submission helper script...created helper script: \"submit_strauto_jobs.sh\"', and 'Creating postprocessing script...created post-script: \"post_strauto.sh\"'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the StrAuto jobs submitted after the scripts are generated?",
    "answer": "The jobs are submitted by running `bash submit_strauto_jobs.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the final step after all StrAuto jobs have completed?",
    "answer": "After all jobs are completed, run `bash post_strauto.sh` to aggregate the results and execute StructureHarvester."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the license for the `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` program?",
    "answer": "The program is licensed under the conditions of the 'MIT License'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is the copyright holder of `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py`?",
    "answer": "Oliver Stueker holds the copyright (2017-2020)."
