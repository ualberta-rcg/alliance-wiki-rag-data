    "question": "What is Bowtie 2 used for?",
    "answer": "Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool designed for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences, particularly effective for reads between 50 to 1,000s of characters, and suitable for large genomes like mammalian ones."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which types of alignment modes does Bowtie 2 support?",
    "answer": "Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical memory footprint for Bowtie 2 when indexing the human genome?",
    "answer": "For the human genome, Bowtie 2's memory footprint is typically around 3.2 GB, achieved by indexing the genome with an FM Index."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more information about Bowtie 2?",
    "answer": "More information about Bowtie 2 can be found on its homepage: http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key methods implemented by the BPP software?",
    "answer": "The BPP software implements four methods: estimation of parameters for species divergence times and population sizes under the multi-species coalescent (MSC) model, inference of the species tree, species delimitation, and joint species delimitation and species tree estimation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the bracken software?",
    "answer": "Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN) is a highly accurate statistical method that calculates the abundance of species in DNA sequences from metagenomics samples, utilizing taxonomy labels assigned by Kraken."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Bracken compatible with different versions of Kraken?",
    "answer": "Yes, Bracken is compatible with both Kraken 1 and Kraken 2. Users should specify kmer length 31 for Kraken 1 defaults and 35 for Kraken 2 defaults."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of data does breseq analyze?",
    "answer": "breseq is a computational pipeline specifically designed for the analysis of short-read re-sequencing data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Brotli?",
    "answer": "Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that uses a combination of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding, and 2nd order context modeling."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Brotli's compression performance compare to other methods?",
    "answer": "Brotli offers a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods, and its speed is similar to deflate but with denser compression."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the available versions of Bowtie 2?",
    "answer": "Bowtie 2 is available in versions 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 2.5.1, 2.5.2, and 2.5.4."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the homepage for the BPP project?",
    "answer": "The homepage for the BPP project is https://github.com/bpp/bpp."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of bracken are mentioned?",
    "answer": "The mentioned versions of bracken are 2.6.0, 2.7, and 3.0."
