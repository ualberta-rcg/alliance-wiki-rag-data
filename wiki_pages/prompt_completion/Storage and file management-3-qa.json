    "question": "What is the recommended method for a program to efficiently search within a file?",
    "answer": "The fastest method is for the program to read the entire file completely before initiating the search."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should files that are no longer actively used but must be kept be managed?",
    "answer": "Files that are no longer actively used but must be retained should be archived and compressed, and if possible, moved to an alternative location like nearline storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can cause problems when performing parallel write access to files on shared filesystems?",
    "answer": "Parallel write access to files on shared filesystems like home, scratch, and project is likely to create problems unless a specialized tool such as MPI-IO is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted if current storage options do not meet specific user needs?",
    "answer": "If your needs are not well served by the available storage options, you should contact technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are filesystem quotas and policy restrictions implemented?",
    "answer": "Filesystem quotas and policy restrictions are implemented to ensure adequate space for all users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What storage spaces are typically accessible to users and groups by default on the clusters?",
    "answer": "By default on our clusters, each user has access to the home and scratch spaces, and each group has access to 1 TB of project space."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users request small increases in project and scratch storage space?",
    "answer": "Small increases in project and scratch spaces are available through our Rapid Access Service (RAS)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What mechanism is available for larger increases in project storage space?",
    "answer": "Larger increases in project spaces are available through the annual Resource Allocation Competition (RAC)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which command allows users to check their current quota usage across various filesystems?",
    "answer": "Users can see their current quota usage for various filesystems on our clusters using the `diskusage_report` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default quota for Home Space on the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "On the Fir cluster, the default quota for Home Space is 50 GB and 500K files per user, and this quota is fixed and cannot be changed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the Scratch Space on the Fir cluster purge old files?",
    "answer": "Yes, on the Fir cluster, files older than 60 days are purged from Scratch Space."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum increase for Project Space on the Fir cluster via a RAS request?",
    "answer": "Project space on the Fir cluster can be increased up to 40 TB per group by a RAS request, subject to specific limitations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default quota for Nearline Space on the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "The default quota for Nearline Space on the Fir cluster is 2 TB and 5000 files per group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Home Space on the Nibi cluster Lustre-based?",
    "answer": "No, Home Space on the Nibi cluster is not Lustre-based."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default quota for Scratch Space on the Nibi cluster, and is it backed up?",
    "answer": "The default quota for Scratch Space on Nibi is 20 TB hard / 1 TB soft and 1M files per user, and it is not backed up."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the soft quota policy for Scratch space on the Nibi cluster.",
    "answer": "An 1 TB soft quota applies to each researcher on Nibi's Scratch space. This soft quota can be exceeded for up to 60 days, after which no additional files may be written until the researcher removes enough files to bring their total usage under 1 TB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default quota for Nearline Space on the Nibi cluster?",
    "answer": "The default quota for Nearline Space on the Nibi cluster is 10 TB and 5000 files per group."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did the new Rapid Access Service (RAS) policies allowing larger quotas become effective?",
    "answer": "New Rapid Access Service (RAS) policies allowing larger quotas for project and nearline spaces became effective on April 1, 2024."
