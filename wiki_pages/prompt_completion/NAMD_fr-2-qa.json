    "question": "What is the purpose of the UCX with GPU tasks example for B\u00e9luga?",
    "answer": "The example for B\u00e9luga demonstrates how to use 8 processes across 2 nodes, with each process utilizing 10 threads and 1 GPU, to fully leverage the B\u00e9luga GPU nodes for NAMD jobs, which offers the best performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many cores and GPUs do B\u00e9luga's GPU nodes have, according to the example?",
    "answer": "B\u00e9luga's GPU nodes have 40 cores and 4 GPUs per node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might NAMD report only 72 cores being used in the B\u00e9luga multi-GPU example, even if more are allocated?",
    "answer": "One core per task is reserved for a communication thread, which makes NAMD reporting 72 cores used a normal occurrence."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the specifications of Narval GPU nodes mentioned in the multi-GPU task example?",
    "answer": "Narval GPU nodes have 48 cores and 4 GPUs per node."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the Narval multi-GPU example, how many processes, threads per process, and GPUs per process are utilized?",
    "answer": "The example uses 8 processes in total on 2 nodes, with each process (task) utilizing 12 threads and 1 GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does NAMD report only 88 cores being used in the Narval multi-GPU example?",
    "answer": "One core per task has to be reserved for a communications thread, so NAMD reporting that only 88 cores are being used is normal."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should one adapt the multi-GPU script for use on a different cluster?",
    "answer": "To use the script on another cluster, you should check the characteristics of the available nodes on that cluster and adjust the `--cpus-per-task` and `--gpus-per-node` options accordingly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can UCX versions of NAMD be used across all clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, UCX versions of NAMD can be used on all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are loaded in the UCX NAMD job script example for multi-GPU tasks?",
    "answer": "The example script loads `StdEnv/2020`, `intel/2020.1.217`, `cuda/11.0`, and `namd-ucx-smp/2.14`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `Molecular Dynamics Performance Guide`?",
    "answer": "The `Molecular Dynamics Performance Guide`, created by an ACENET team, describes optimal conditions for running tasks on clusters with AMBER, GROMACS, OpenMM, and NAMD."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it recommended to perform benchmarking for NAMD simulations?",
    "answer": "Benchmarking is recommended because NAMD's performance varies with the simulated system (especially the number of atoms), making it very useful for optimizing long-duration simulations and documenting resource allocation requests."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the suggestions for obtaining relevant benchmarking results?",
    "answer": "To obtain relevant results, it's suggested to vary the number of steps so that the simulation runs for a few minutes, and data collection occurs at intervals of at least a few seconds. Running for too short a time can lead to variations in duration results."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which cluster was used for the standard apoa1 benchmarking data presented?",
    "answer": "The standard apoa1 benchmarking data was performed on the Graham cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the node specifications for the Graham cluster mentioned in the benchmarking context?",
    "answer": "The Graham cluster has 32-core CPU nodes and GPU nodes with 32 cores and 2 GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is efficiency calculated in the NAMD 2.12 CPU benchmarking table?",
    "answer": "Efficiency is calculated using the formula: (duration with 1 core) / (N * (duration with N cores))."
  },
  {
    "question": "Based on the NAMD 2.12 CPU benchmarking data, what is an acceptable number of cores for the described system simulation?",
    "answer": "It is acceptable to use 256 cores for simulating the system, as the efficiency remains at 90%."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if you request more cores than necessary for your NAMD tasks?",
    "answer": "If you request more cores than needed, your tasks will experience longer wait times in the queue, which will negatively affect your overall results."
