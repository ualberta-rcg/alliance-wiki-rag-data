  },
  {
    "question": "Why is benchmarking useful for NAMD simulations?",
    "answer": "Benchmarking is useful because NAMD performance varies with the simulated systems, especially concerning the number of atoms. It can help for long-duration simulations and to document resource allocation requests."
  },
  {
    "question": "What recommendations are given for obtaining relevant benchmarking results?",
    "answer": "It is suggested to vary the number of steps so that the simulation runs for a few minutes and to collect duration data at intervals of at least a few seconds to avoid variations if the execution time is too short."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the consequence of requesting more cores than needed for a NAMD job?",
    "answer": "If more cores than needed are requested, your tasks will wait longer in the queue, affecting your overall result."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD module is used for single-node GPU simulations in the benchmarking data?",
    "answer": "The multicore module of NAMD is used for single-node GPU simulations."

  },
  {
    "question": "What does the GPU benchmarking data suggest about using multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "The GPU benchmarking data indicates that it is absolutely useless to use more than one node since performance decreases with 2 nodes or more."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most efficient single-node GPU configuration according to the benchmarking data for Graham?",
    "answer": "On a single node, it is preferable to use 1 GPU/16 cores for maximum efficiency."
  },
  {
    "question": "What single-node GPU configuration is acceptable if faster results are prioritized?",
    "answer": "The use of 2 GPU/32 cores on a single node is acceptable if your results need to be produced quickly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there an advantage to using 4 or 8 cores on Graham GPU nodes for NAMD tasks?",
    "answer": "No, there is no advantage to using 4 or 8 cores because the priority is the same for all 1 GPU/16 cores tasks on Graham's GPU nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it more economical to use GPUs or non-GPU nodes on Graham for NAMD tasks?",
    "answer": "It is more economical to use GPUs because a GPU node (2 GPU/32 cores) on Graham processes the task faster than 4 non-GPU nodes, even though the cost of a GPU node is nearly twice that of a non-GPU node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances might one consider not using GPUs, despite their economic advantage?",
    "answer": "One might consider not using GPUs if the waiting time becomes too long, as CPU nodes are more numerous."
