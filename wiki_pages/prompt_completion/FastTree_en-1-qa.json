  {
    "question": "What is FastTree used for?",
    "answer": "FastTree infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of sequences can FastTree analyze?",
    "answer": "FastTree can analyze alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many sequences can FastTree handle?",
    "answer": "FastTree can handle alignments with up to a million sequences."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of FastTree modules are available?",
    "answer": "Software modules for single precision and double precision calculations are available for FastTree."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between single precision and double precision in FastTree?",
    "answer": "Single precision is faster, while double precision provides more precise calculations."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is double precision recommended for FastTree?",
    "answer": "Double precision is recommended when using a highly biased transition matrix or when accurate resolution of very short branches is desired."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I see the available FastTree modules?",
    "answer": "You can see the available FastTree modules by running `module spider fasttree`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I load a single precision FastTree module?",
    "answer": "To load a single precision FastTree module, use the command `module load fasttree/2.1.11`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I load a double precision FastTree module?",
    "answer": "To load a double precision FastTree module, use the command `module load fasttree-double/2.1.11`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the error message 'WARNING! This alignment consists of closely-related and very long sequences' indicate?",
    "answer": "This error message indicates that the alignment likely results in very short and sometimes negative branch lengths."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve the FastTree error 'WARNING! This alignment consists of closely-related and very long sequences'?",
    "answer": "To resolve this error, use a `fasttree-double` module for double precision."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the FastTree Web page?",
    "answer": "The FastTree Web page is located at https://morgannprice.github.io/fasttree/."
