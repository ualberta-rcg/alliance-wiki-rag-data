  },
  {
    "question": "Why is full online wandb usage problematic on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA?",
    "answer": "Full online wandb usage on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA is problematic because the wandb package automatically attempts to upload environment information to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, which is not allowed on these clusters' compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if wandb attempts to upload information to Google Cloud Storage on Narval, Rorqual, or TamIA?",
    "answer": "It will result in a crash during or at the very end of a training run, or the job may freeze until it reaches its wall time, wasting resources."
  },

  },
  {
    "question": "How can users use wandb on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA without crashes?",
    "answer": "Users can use wandb by enabling the `offline` mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does wandb's `offline` mode do?",
    "answer": "In `offline` mode, wandb writes all metrics, logs, and artifacts to the local disk and does not attempt to sync anything to the Weights&Biases service on the internet."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can wandb content be synced to the online service after running in offline mode?",
    "answer": "After jobs finish running in offline mode, you can sync their wandb content to the online service by running the command `wandb sync` on the login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there an alternative product similar to Weights & Biases that works on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How can you run wandb in online mode on applicable clusters, according to the example?",
    "answer": "To run in online mode, you need to load the `httpproxy` module on applicable clusters and uncomment `wandb login $API_KEY` while commenting out `wandb offline` in the script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended number of CPUs per task for a Slurm job using wandb?",
    "answer": "At least two CPUs per task are recommended: one for the main process and one for the wandb process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is `wandb` installed in the provided example `wandb-test.sh` script?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to enable offline mode in the example `wandb-test.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The command `wandb offline` is used to enable offline mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is wandb initialized in the Python script `wandb-test.py` example?",
    "answer": "Wandb is initialized using `wandb.init(project=\"wandb-pytorch-test\", settings=wandb.Settings(start_method=\"fork\"))`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are metrics logged in the `wandb-test.py` example?",
    "answer": "Metrics are logged using `wandb.log({'my_metric': my_metric})`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What folder is created after a training run in offline mode?",
    "answer": "After a training run in offline mode, a new folder named `./wandb/offline-run*` will be created."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you send the metrics from offline wandb runs to the server?",
    "answer": "You can send the metrics to the server using the command `wandb sync ./wandb/offline-run*`, where `*` will sync all runs."
