    "question": "What is Weights & Biases (wandb)?",
    "answer": "Weights & Biases (wandb) is a meta machine learning platform designed to help AI practitioners and teams build reliable machine learning models for real-world applications by streamlining the machine learning model lifecycle."
  },
  {
    "question": "What capabilities does wandb provide to users?",
    "answer": "By using wandb, users can track, compare, explain, and reproduce machine learning experiments."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the essential requirements for full wandb functionality on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Full usage of wandb on compute nodes requires internet access and access to Google Cloud Storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Alliance clusters have limited wandb availability?",
    "answer": "B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA clusters have limited wandb availability."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is wandb usage limited on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA clusters?",
    "answer": "Wandb usage is limited on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA because the package automatically attempts to upload environment information to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, which is not allowed on their compute nodes and can cause crashes or job freezes. Uploading artifacts with `wandb.save()` also requires this access."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users work around the limitations of wandb on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA clusters?",
    "answer": "Users can still use wandb on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA clusters by enabling `offline` mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does wandb's `offline` mode do?",
    "answer": "In `offline` mode, wandb writes all metrics, logs, and artifacts to the local disk and does not attempt to sync anything to the Weights & Biases service on the internet."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you synchronize wandb content to the online service after running in offline mode?",
    "answer": "After jobs finish running in offline mode, you can sync their wandb content to the online service by running the command `wandb sync` on the login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which Alliance clusters is wandb fully available without needing `httpproxy`?",
    "answer": "Wandb is fully available on Cedar and Vulcan clusters, and `httpproxy` is not required for their use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is wandb unavailable on the Graham cluster?",
    "answer": "Wandb is unavailable on the Graham cluster because internet access is disabled on its compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who specifically can use wandb on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA via `httpproxy`?",
    "answer": "Users from MILA and other eligible groups only can use wandb on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA via `httpproxy`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What account type is required for MILA members to use wandb on Alliance clusters with internet access?",
    "answer": "Members of the MILA Qu\u00e9bec AI Institute must use a valid 'Mila-org' Weights & Biases account to log into wandb."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an alternative product similar to Weights & Biases that functions on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA?",
    "answer": "Comet.ml is a product very similar to Weights & Biases and works on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended CPU allocation for an SLURM job using wandb?",
    "answer": "At least two CPUs per task are recommended for an SLURM job using wandb; one for the main process and one for the wandb process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can wandb be installed in a virtual environment without internet access for an SLURM job?",
    "answer": "Wandb can be installed using `pip install --no-index wandb` after activating a virtual environment created with `virtualenv --no-download $SLURM_TMPDIR/env`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command activates offline mode for wandb within a script?",
    "answer": "The command `wandb offline` activates offline mode for wandb within a script."
  },
  {
    "question": "After an offline wandb run, where are the local metrics and logs stored?",
    "answer": "After an offline wandb run, metrics and logs are stored in a new folder typically named `./wandb/offline-run*`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you sync all local offline wandb runs to the server?",
    "answer": "You can sync all local offline wandb runs to the server using the command `wandb sync ./wandb/offline-run*`."
  },
  {
    "question": "To run the provided example script in online mode, what steps are necessary?",
    "answer": "To run the provided example script in online mode, you need to load the `httpproxy` module on applicable clusters, uncomment the `wandb login $API_KEY` line, and comment out `wandb offline`."
