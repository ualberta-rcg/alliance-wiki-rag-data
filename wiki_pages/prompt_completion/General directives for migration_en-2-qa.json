    "question": "What is a simple method to check for data corruption after migration?",
    "answer": "A crude way to check for corruption is to compare file sizes at the source with file sizes at the destination."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one achieve greater assurance when verifying data integrity post-migration?",
    "answer": "For greater assurance, you can use `cksum` or `md5sum` at both the source and destination, and then compare the results."
