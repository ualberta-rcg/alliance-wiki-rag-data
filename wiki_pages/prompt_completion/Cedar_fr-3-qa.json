  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for specifying node types for applications?",
    "answer": "It is recommended not to specify the node type for tasks, as the performance difference between Broadwell, Skylake, or Cascade Lake nodes should not be significant compared to waiting times."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user explicitly request a 'cascade' node type for a job?",
    "answer": "To request a 'cascade' node type, use the constraint `--constraint=cascade`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which constraint should be used to request a node with AVX512 support?",
    "answer": "If an AVX512 node is needed, use the constraint `--constraint=[skylake|cascade]`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did the policy change regarding job submission from the `/home` file system come into effect?",
    "answer": "The policy change preventing tasks from being executed in the `/home` file system was implemented on April 17, 2019."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the reason behind the policy change preventing job execution from `/home`?",
    "answer": "This modification aims to decrease the load and improve the interactive response time within `/home`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What action should be taken if a user encounters the message 'Submitting jobs from directories residing in /home is not permitted'?",
    "answer": "If this message appears, the user should transfer their files to their `/project` or `/scratch` directory and submit the task from the new location."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the total theoretical maximum double-precision performance of Cedar's CPUs and GPUs?",
    "answer": "The total theoretical maximum double-precision performance is nearly 14 petaflops, combining 6547 teraflops from CPUs and 7434 teraflops from GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the network topology of Cedar.",
    "answer": "The network topology is a composition of islands with a 2:1 blocking factor between them. Most islands have 32 nodes fully connected by a non-blocking Omni-Path fabric."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many cores are in each Broadwell island?",
    "answer": "Each of the 16 Broadwell islands contains 32 nodes with 32 cores each, for a total of 1024 cores per island."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the core count per island for Skylake or Cascade Lake nodes?",
    "answer": "For the 43 islands of Skylake or Cascade Lake nodes, each island has 32 nodes with 48 cores each, totaling 1536 cores per island."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many islands are equipped with P100 GPU nodes?",
    "answer": "There are 4 islands equipped with 32 P100 GPU nodes each."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types and quantities of large-memory Broadwell nodes are available in Cedar's dedicated islands?",
    "answer": "There are 2 islands dedicated to large-memory Broadwell nodes, comprising 64 nodes in total: 40 nodes of 0.5TB, 16 nodes of 1.5TB, 6 nodes of 4TB, and 2 nodes of 6TB."
