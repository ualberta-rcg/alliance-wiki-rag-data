    "question": "What is the purpose of the CDO software?",
    "answer": "CDO is a collection of command line Operators designed to manipulate and analyse Climate and NWP model Data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Cell Ranger and what does it do?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger is a suite of analysis pipelines that processes Chromium single cell 3'-RNA-seq output to align reads, generate gene-cell matrices, and perform clustering and gene expression analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of Chromium Single Cell reagent kits are supported by Cell Ranger 1.2 and later?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger 1.2 and later support libraries generated by the Chromium Single Cell 3i-v1 and v2 reagent kits."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main gene expression pipelines included in Cell Ranger?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger includes four main gene expression pipelines: cellranger mkfastq, cellranger count, cellranger aggr, and cellranger reanalyze."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the cellranger mkfastq pipeline?",
    "answer": "The cellranger mkfastq pipeline wraps Illumina's bcl2fastq to demultiplex Chromium-prepared sequencing samples and convert barcode and read data to FASTQ files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of data processing does cellranger count perform?",
    "answer": "Cellranger count takes FASTQ files and performs alignment, filtering, and UMI counting."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does cellranger aggr work?",
    "answer": "Cellranger aggr aggregates outputs from multiple runs of cellranger count, normalizing those runs to the same sequencing depth and then recomputing the gene-barcode matrices and analysis on the combined data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the cellranger reanalyze pipeline?",
    "answer": "Cellranger reanalyze takes gene-barcode matrices produced by cellranger count or cellranger aggr and reruns the dimensionality reduction, clustering, and gene expression algorithms using tunable parameter settings."
  },
  {
    "question": "What formats does Cell Ranger use for its output?",
    "answer": "Output from Cell Ranger is delivered in standard BAM, MEX, CSV, HDF5, and HTML formats, augmented with cellular information."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the current version of Cell Ranger mentioned?",
    "answer": "The version of Cell Ranger mentioned is 2.1.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was cellsnp-lite originally designed for?",
    "answer": "cellsnp-lite was originally designed to pileup expressed alleles in single-cell or bulk RNA-seq data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can cellsnp-lite be used for data types other than RNA-seq?",
    "answer": "Yes, besides RNA-seq data, cellsnp-lite can also be applied to DNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, either in bulk or single-cell."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Centrifuge?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge is a novel microbial classification engine that enables rapid, accurate, and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species on desktop computers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What indexing scheme does Centrifuge use?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge uses a novel indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of Centrifuge's indexing scheme?",
    "answer": "It allows Centrifuge to use a relatively small index (4.7 GB for all complete bacterial, viral, and human genomes) and classify sequences at very high speed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is cereal?",
    "answer": "cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of data transformations can cereal perform?",
    "answer": "cereal takes arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into different representations, such such as compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does cereal require external dependencies?",
    "answer": "No, cereal has no external dependencies and can be easily bundled with other code or used standalone."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of cereal are available?",
    "answer": "Versions 1.3.0 and 1.3.2 of cereal are available."
