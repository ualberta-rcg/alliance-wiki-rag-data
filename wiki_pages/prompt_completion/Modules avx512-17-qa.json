    "question": "What is Centrifuge?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge is a microbial classification engine designed for rapid, accurate, and sensitive labeling and quantification of species from sequencing reads on desktop computers. It uses a novel indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the memory requirement for the Centrifuge index?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge requires a relatively small index of 4.7 GB for all complete bacterial and viral genomes plus the human genome."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of the 'cereal' library?",
    "answer": "Cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library that converts arbitrary data types into different representations like compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON, and vice versa."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of problems can Ceres Solver address?",
    "answer": "Ceres Solver can solve non-linear least squares problems with bounds constraints and general unconstrained optimization problems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Community Earth System Model (CESM) used for?",
    "answer": "CESM is a fully-coupled, global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climate states."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is CFITSIO?",
    "answer": "CFITSIO is a library of C and Fortran subroutines for reading and writing data files in the FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data format."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is CFOUR (Coupled-Cluster techniques for Computational Chemistry)?",
    "answer": "CFOUR is a program package for performing high-level quantum chemical calculations on atoms and molecules, offering sophisticated ab initio methods based on Muller-Plesset perturbation theory and the coupled-cluster approximation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is CFOUR commercial software?",
    "answer": "No, CFOUR is not a commercial code; it is free for non-commercial purposes, requiring only a license agreement."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which software module allows for rapid processing of millions of reads from high-throughput DNA sequencing runs within minutes?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge allows for rapid processing of millions of reads from a typical high-throughput DNA sequencing run within a few minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the available versions for the 'cereal' module?",
    "answer": "The available versions for the 'cereal' module are 1.3.0 and 1.3.2."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which module is a physics-based simulation tool?",
    "answer": "CESM is a physics-based simulation tool classified under 'geo' for geographical applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the CFOUR-MPI module?",
    "answer": "CFOUR-MPI is a parallel version of CFOUR, a program package for performing high-level quantum chemical calculations on atoms and molecules, with an emphasis on ab initio methods."
