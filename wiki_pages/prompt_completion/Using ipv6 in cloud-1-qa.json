  {
    "question": "What types of IPv6 addresses are available in the Arbutus cloud environment?",
    "answer": "IPv6 Link-Local (LLA) and Global Unicast Addresses (GUA) are generally available."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are Global Unicast Addresses (GUA) set up for IPv6 traffic?",
    "answer": "GUA can be set up via a separate interface that handles only the IPv6 traffic."
  },
  {
    "question": "What method is used for automatically setting up IP addresses on a VM interface in Arbutus Cloud?",
    "answer": "Addresses are being set up using 'Stateless Address Auto Configuration' (SLAAC), which automatically sets up the IP on the VM interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default security group rules for outbound IPv6 GUA traffic from a VM?",
    "answer": "By default, the security group rules will allow all outbound traffic from the VM via the IPv6 GUA."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are inbound connections allowed to a VM via IPv6 GUA by default?",
    "answer": "No traffic that originates from outside the VM will be allowed until specific security group rules have been defined."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you obtain the ID of a VM using the OpenStack CLI?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `openstack server list` to get the ID of the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What OpenStack CLI command is used to assign a new network interface with IPv6 to a VM?",
    "answer": "The command is `openstack server add network <VM_ID> IPv6-GUA`, for example `openstack server add network 74be352d-19ca-46cc-9661-7088d2652e34 IPv6-GUA`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you check the status of an IPv6 network assignment after adding it via OpenStack CLI?",
    "answer": "You can check the status of the assignment by running `openstack server list` again."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are involved in attaching an IPv6 interface using the OpenStack Webinterface?",
    "answer": "Log in to the dashboard, go to the 'Instances' menu, click on 'Attach Interface', select 'IPv6-GUA' from the network menu, and click on 'Attach'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the Global Unicast Address (GUA) when an IPv6 interface is detached?",
    "answer": "Every time the interface is detached, the GUA is released and put back into the pool, making it available for use by anyone else."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does rebuilding or restarting a VM release its assigned IPv6 GUA?",
    "answer": "No, rebuilding or restarting the VM will not release the GUA."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can access from any IPv6 GUA be granted in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "Access from any IPv6 GUA can be granted via 'Security Groups' in OpenStack."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary difference when configuring security groups for IPv6 GUA compared to IPv4 in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "The only difference is the CIDR, which automatically detects the address type."
  },
  {
    "question": "How will an OpenStack IPv6 network interface typically appear in a Linux VM?",
    "answer": "It will appear as an additional eth-type interface, usually `/dev/eth1` if `/dev/eth0` is the existing interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you confirm if IPv6 is enabled in a Linux system?",
    "answer": "You can confirm by running the command `sudo sysctl -a | grep ipv6.*disable`. The output should all end in zeros."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default state of IPv6 in recent Linux images?",
    "answer": "IPv6 enabled is the default in all recent images."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should kernel parameters be added if they need to be changed for IPv6 in Linux?",
    "answer": "Any kernel parameters that need to be changed to zero should be added to `/etc/sysctl.conf`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which kernel parameters should be added to `/etc/sysctl.conf` for an IPv6-enabled interface like eth1?",
    "answer": "The following kernel parameters should be added: `net.ipv6.conf.eth1.forwarding=0` and `net.ipv6.conf.eth1.accept_ra=1`."
