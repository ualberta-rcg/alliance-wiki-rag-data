    "question": "How can I view resource usage for my groups in the CCDB?",
    "answer": "You can view resource usage by logging into the CCDB and navigating to 'My Account > View Group Usage'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information does the CCDB display regarding CPU and GPU core year values?",
    "answer": "CPU and GPU core year values in the CCDB are calculated based on the quantity of resources allocated to jobs, not core-equivalent measures. This means for large memory jobs, the values might not match the cluster scheduler's representation of usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main options available in the first tab bar for viewing usage in CCDB?",
    "answer": "The first tab bar offers options to view usage 'By Compute Resource', 'By Resource Allocation Project', 'By Submitter', and 'Storage usage'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of information is presented in the 'Usage by compute resource' view?",
    "answer": "This view displays the usage of compute resources per cluster for groups you own or are a member of, covering the current allocation year starting April 1st. The tables include total usage to date and projected usage to the end of the current allocation period."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I see a more detailed monthly breakdown of usage by compute resource in CCDB?",
    "answer": "From the 'Extra Info' column of the usage table in the 'Usage by compute resource' view, you can click 'Show monthly usage' to display a further breakdown by month for a specific cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to view usage by individual submitters within a cluster in CCDB?",
    "answer": "Yes, in the 'Usage by compute resource' view, you can click 'Show submitter usage' from the 'Extra Info' column to see a breakdown by the specific users who submitted jobs on that cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'Usage by resource allocation project' tab display?",
    "answer": "This tab shows RAPIs (Resource Allocation Project Identifiers) for the selected allocation year, along with detailed information for each allocation project and the resources used across all clusters. It also summarizes account name, project title, ownership, allocation, and usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does CCDB handle GPU usage for resource allocation projects?",
    "answer": "For resource allocation projects with GPU usage, the table is broken down into usage on various GPU models and measured in Reference GPU Units (RGUs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'Usage by submitter' view provide?",
    "answer": "The 'Usage by submitter' view groups usage by individual users who submitted jobs from within the resource allocation projects, aggregated across all systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I see a user's monthly usage broken down by cluster in CCDB?",
    "answer": "After selecting a user in the 'Usage by submitter' view, you can display their usage broken down by cluster. From there, you can click the 'Show monthly usage' link in the 'Extra Info' column of the CPU/GPU Usage table for a specific resource row."
