    "question": "What is an example SBATCH script for running QIIME2 with Apptainer?",
    "answer": "An example SBATCH script includes directives for time and account, followed by multiple `apptainer exec` commands to perform QIIME operations like importing data and fitting classifiers within a specified Apptainer image."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Apptainer bind mounts are used in the example QIIME2 SBATCH script?",
    "answer": "The example script uses `-B $PWD:/home`, `-B /scratch/someuser:/outputs`, and `-B /project/def-somePI/someuser/path/to/inputs:/inputs` to bind the current working directory, a scratch directory, and an input directory respectively, into the Apptainer container."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you import sequence data into QIIME format using Apptainer, as shown in the example?",
    "answer": "Sequence data is imported using the command `qiime tools import --type 'FeatureData[Sequence]' --input-path /inputs/some_fastafile.fa --output-path /outputs/some_output_feature.qza` within an `apptainer exec` call."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you import taxonomy data into QIIME format, specifically from a headerless TSV file, using Apptainer?",
    "answer": "Taxonomy data from a headerless TSV file is imported using `qiime tools import --type 'FeatureData[Taxonomy]' --input-format HeaderlessTSVTaxonomyFormat --input-path /inputs/some_taxonomy_file.tax --output-path /outputs/some_output_ref-taxonomy.qza` within an `apptainer exec` call."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a naive Bayes classifier fitted in QIIME using Apptainer, according to the provided script?",
    "answer": "A naive Bayes classifier is fitted using `qiime feature-classifier fit-classifier-naive-bayes --i-reference-reads /outputs/some_output_feature.qza --i-reference-taxonomy /outputs/some_output_ref-taxonomy.qza --o-classifier /outputs/some_output_classifier.qza` within an `apptainer exec` call."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to use the bind option (`-B`) with Apptainer when working with containers?",
    "answer": "It is important to use the bind option (`-B`) with each folder you want to work with when running programs in your container to ensure you can access your data within the container environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What common error might occur when first importing data into QIIME format with Apptainer?",
    "answer": "You may receive an error ending with \"Timezone offset does not match system offset: 0 != -18000. Please, check your config files.\" when first importing data into QIIME format."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'Timezone offset does not match system offset' error be resolved when using Apptainer with QIIME?",
    "answer": "This error can be resolved by setting the time zone to UTC before invoking Apptainer, specifically by running `export TZ='UTC'` before your `apptainer exec` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find more information about Apptainer?",
    "answer": "More information about Apptainer, particularly regarding bind mounts, can be found in the Apptainer documentation or by watching an Apptainer webinar."
