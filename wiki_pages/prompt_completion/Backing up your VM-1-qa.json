    "question": "What is strongly encouraged when creating virtual machine backups?",
    "answer": "Creating backups in locations outside the cloud is strongly encouraged."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the 3-2-1 backup rule.",
    "answer": "The 3-2-1 backup rule states that you should have three copies of your data stored on at least two different types of media, and one of those copies should be offsite."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which tools can be used for file backups within a virtual machine to remote locations?",
    "answer": "Tools such as rsync, duplicity, borg, or restic can be used to perform file backups of data within your VM to remote locations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of provisioning tools in VM management?",
    "answer": "Provisioning tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and SaltStack can automate the setup and configuration of software and operating systems, making virtual machine recreation trivial with the right specification files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can specification files for provisioning tools be managed?",
    "answer": "Specification files can be managed with version control tools like Git."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can provisioning tools be combined to automate VM creation?",
    "answer": "Provisioning tools can be combined with orchestration tools such as Heat and Terraform to automate the entire process of virtual machine creation and software configuration."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should data generated outside of automation be backed up?",
    "answer": "Any data generated or created outside automation would need to be backed up using file backup methods."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two different storage options available in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "OpenStack has two different storage options: Volumes, which are protected by 3 times replication, and ephemeral storage local to the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of protection does the 3 times replication for OpenStack Volumes provide?",
    "answer": "The 3 times replication of Volumes protects against hardware failure but does not protect against accidental deletion or data loss from malicious intent."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is ephemeral storage in OpenStack best suited for?",
    "answer": "Data stored on node local ephemeral storage is best suited to temporary or working data and should not be relied upon for any critical data due to potential data loss from hardware failure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tools does OpenStack provide for managing virtual machines?",
    "answer": "OpenStack provides tools to create disk images and snapshots of your virtual machines."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main VM flavors in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "The two main VM flavors in OpenStack are persistent (p) and compute (c)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are Persistent VMs designed to boot?",
    "answer": "Persistent VMs are designed to boot from volumes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the best method to create a copy of a volume for backup purposes for Persistent VMs?",
    "answer": "The best way to create a copy of a volume for backup purposes is to create an image from that volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can an image created from an OpenStack volume be used for?",
    "answer": "An image can be downloaded, reused to create multiple new VMs, accessed by VirtualBox on a desktop or laptop, and uploaded to other clouds."
  },
  {
    "question": "What must be done to a volume before an image can be created from it?",
    "answer": "To create an image from a volume, that volume must be detached from the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the volume you want to create an image from is the root volume of a Persistent VM?",
    "answer": "If the volume is the root volume of the VM, it cannot be detached unless the VM is deleted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a trick to prevent a root volume from being deleted when a VM is deleted, especially if you are unsure about the 'Delete Volume on Instance Delete' setting?",
    "answer": "A trick is to create a snapshot of the volume, as volumes cannot be deleted if there is a volume snapshot created from them. This ensures the volume remains even if the 'Delete Volume on Instance Delete' box was checked."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what state should volumes be to create images from them?",
    "answer": "All volumes you wish to create images of should be in the 'Available' state."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create an image from a volume in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "To create an image from a volume, select 'Upload to Image' from the drop-down menu for the volume, then select the 'QCOW2' disk format and give your image a name."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which disk format is recommended for images in OpenStack and why?",
    "answer": "QCOW2 is recommended because it works well with OpenStack and typically does not take up as much space as 'Raw' images."
  },
  {
    "question": "What other disk formats are useful when working with virtualization tools like VirtualBox?",
    "answer": "Other disk formats like 'vmdk' and 'vdi' can be useful when working with virtualization tools such as VirtualBox."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you revert file changes on a volume using a snapshot?",
    "answer": "You can create a new volume from a snapshot of a volume, for example, if there were file changes since the last volume snapshot you would like to revert."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are volume snapshots ideal for backups, and can they be downloaded?",
    "answer": "Volume snapshots are not ideal for backups because they depend on the original volume remaining intact, and it is also not possible to download them."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a volume snapshot save?",
    "answer": "A volume snapshot will save the state of a volume at the time the snapshot was created."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do VM snapshots behave for persistent VMs?",
    "answer": "If you have a persistent VM and create a snapshot of the VM, OpenStack creates a nearly empty image containing pointers to volume snapshots of the persistent VM's boot volume and any attached volumes created as part of the VM snapshot process."
