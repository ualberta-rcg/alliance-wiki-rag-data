    "question": "On which clusters is the project filesystem organized by groups?",
    "answer": "The project filesystem is organized by groups on B\u00e9luga, Cedar, Graham, and Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do users typically access their project space?",
    "answer": "Users normally access the project space through symbolic links in their home directory, which have the form `$HOME/projects/group_name`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who owns the group space and what are the default permissions for members?",
    "answer": "The group space is owned by the principal investigator (PI) for the group, and members have read and write permission on this directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default readability for a newly created file in the group space?",
    "answer": "By default, a newly created file will only be readable by group members."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a group create a directory for writeable files?",
    "answer": "The best approach is to create a special directory using `mkdir $HOME/projects/def-profname/group_writable` followed by `setfacl -d -m g::rwx $HOME/projects/def-profname/group_writable`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more information on sharing data, file ownership, and ACLs?",
    "answer": "More information on sharing data, file ownership, and access control lists (ACLs) can be found on the 'Sharing data' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default quota for project space per group?",
    "answer": "The project space is subject to a default quota of 1 TB and 500,000 files per group."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a group's project space quota be increased?",
    "answer": "The default quota can be increased up to 10 TB of space upon request to Technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a project storage allocation be transferred to another cluster?",
    "answer": "No, this storage allocation is specific to a particular cluster and cannot normally be transferred to another cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How might groups acquire quotas higher than 10 TB?",
    "answer": "Certain groups may have been awarded significantly higher quotas through the annual Resource Allocation Competition."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to check current usage and available disk space?",
    "answer": "To check current usage and available disk space, use the command `diskusage_report`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of setting the `setgid` bit on a project directory?",
    "answer": "Setting the `setgid` bit ensures that files copied or moved to a given project space acquire the appropriate group membership and are counted against the expected quota, with new files and subdirectories inheriting the directory's group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the `setgid` bit change the group membership of existing files and subdirectories?",
    "answer": "No, existing files and subdirectories will not have their group membership changed; this should be done with the `chgrp` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you set the `setgid` bit on a directory?",
    "answer": "You can set the `setgid` bit on a directory with the command `chmod g+s <directory name>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the `setgid` bit be applied to existing subdirectories of a directory?",
    "answer": "To apply the `setgid` bit to existing subdirectories, use the command `find <directory name> -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod g+s`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user temporarily change their default group during an interactive session?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `newgrp` to modify your default group during an interactive session, for example, `newgrp rrg-profname-ab`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is a default group change made with `newgrp` permanent?",
    "answer": "No, `newgrp` will only change your default group for the particular session; at your next login, you will need to reuse the command if you wish to change it again."
  },
  {
    "question": "What often causes 'disk quota exceeded' errors in project filesystems?",
    "answer": "Disk quota exceeded errors may well be due to files being associated with the wrong group, notably your personal group, which has a quota of only 2 MB."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users find and fix the group membership of files causing quota exceeded errors?",
    "answer": "Users can use the command `find <directory name> -group $USER -print0 | xargs -0 chgrp -h <group>` where `<group>` is a group with a reasonable quota, such as `def-profname`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the shared project directory between a PI ('Sue') and her sponsored user ('Bob') in the example?",
    "answer": "In the example, both Sue and Bob's `~/projects/def-sue` directories point to the same location, `/project/<some random number>`, which is the best place for them to share data."
