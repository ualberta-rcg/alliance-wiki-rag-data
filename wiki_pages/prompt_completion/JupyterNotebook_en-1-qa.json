    "answer": "Jupyter Notebook can be run on a compute node or, less recommended, on a login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is running Jupyter Notebook on a login node not recommended?",
    "answer": "Login nodes impose various user- and process-based limits, meaning applications running there may be terminated if they consume excessive CPU time or memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to use a compute node for Jupyter Notebook?",
    "answer": "To use a compute node, you must submit a job requesting the number of CPUs (and optionally GPUs), the amount of memory, and the run time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended instead of Jupyter Notebook for a newer interface?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to consider installing JupyterLab instead, as Jupyter Notebook is the older Jupyter interface."

  {
    "question": "What is Jupyter Lmod?",
    "answer": "Jupyter Lmod is an extension that enables interaction with environment modules before launching kernels, using Lmod's Python interface for tasks like loading and unloading modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you install the Jupyter Lmod extension?",
    "answer": "The Jupyter Lmod extension is installed by running `pip install jupyterlmod`, then `jupyter nbextension install --py jupyterlmod --sys-prefix`, `jupyter nbextension enable --py jupyterlmod --sys-prefix`, and `jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlmod --sys-prefix`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is nbserverproxy used for?",
    "answer": "nbserverproxy enables users to access arbitrary web services running within their spawned Jupyter server, particularly useful for services listening only on a localhost port like TensorBoard."
  },

  },
  {
    "question": "What is RStudio Launcher?",
    "answer": "RStudio Launcher is a Jupyter Notebook extension that adds an 'RStudio Session' option to the 'New' dropdown list, allowing Jupyter Notebook to start an RStudio session with its token authentication system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the software environment requirements for installing RStudio Launcher?",
    "answer": "The RStudio Launcher installation procedure only works with the `StdEnv/2016.4` and `StdEnv/2018.3` software environments."
