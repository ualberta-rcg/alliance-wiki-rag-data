  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the PROJECT storage space?",
    "answer": "The PROJECT space is intended for sharing data among members of a research group and is linked to a professor's account."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of data should be stored in the PROJECT space?",
    "answer": "Data stored in the PROJECT space should be fairly static, meaning it is not likely to be changed many times in a month, to avoid burdening the tape-based backup system."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should I use the SCRATCH storage space?",
    "answer": "SCRATCH is the best choice for intensive read/write operations on large files (over 100 MB per file)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are files stored in SCRATCH backed up?",
    "answer": "No, files stored in SCRATCH are not backed up, and older files are subject to purging."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of files are suitable for SCRATCH storage?",
    "answer": "SCRATCH should be used for temporary files like checkpoint files, job output, and other data that can be easily recreated. It should not be regarded as normal storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is NEARLINE storage used for?",
    "answer": "NEARLINE is a tape-based filesystem intended for inactive data, specifically datasets you do not expect to access for months, and is typically found at `/nearline`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is `$SLURM_TMPDIR`?",
    "answer": "`$SLURM_TMPDIR` is an environment variable that holds a unique path to a temporary folder on a fast, local filesystem on each compute node allocated to a job."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are the contents of `$SLURM_TMPDIR` deleted?",
    "answer": "The directory and its contents within `$SLURM_TMPDIR` are deleted automatically when the job ends."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the advantage of using `$SLURM_TMPDIR` compared to other networked filesystems?",
    "answer": "The advantage of `$SLURM_TMPDIR` is increased performance because the filesystem is local to the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what kind of files is `$SLURM_TMPDIR` particularly well-suited?",
    "answer": "`$SLURM_TMPDIR` is especially well-suited for large collections of small files (e.g., smaller than a few megabytes per file)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users estimate their space and file count usage on the entire PROJECT space?",
    "answer": "Users can obtain an estimate by running the command `lfs quota -u $USER /project`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users estimate the number of files in a specific directory and its subdirectories?",
    "answer": "Users can obtain an estimate using the command `lfs find <path to the directory> -type f | wc -l`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended best practice for cleaning up data in scratch and project spaces?",
    "answer": "Regularly clean up your data in the scratch and project spaces because they are used for huge data collections."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended procedure for deleting a set of files?",
    "answer": "Create a temporary directory `toDelete`, move the files to be deleted into it, verify the contents of `toDelete`, and then delete `toDelete` recursively."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a best practice regarding the use of `*` and `/` characters in `rm` commands?",
    "answer": "If possible, avoid using `*` and `/` characters in your `rm` commands, and always navigate to the parent directory and double-check you are in the correct directory before deleting items."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommendation for using text format files?",
    "answer": "Only use text format for files that are smaller than a few megabytes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should temporary files be stored?",
    "answer": "As far as possible, use scratch and local storage for temporary files, including the temporary directory created by the job scheduler, `$SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the fastest way to search within a file?",
    "answer": "The fastest way to search within a file is to first read it completely before searching."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done with unused files that must be retained?",
    "answer": "If you no longer use certain files but they must be retained, archive and compress them, and if possible, move them to an alternative location like nearline storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What issues can arise from parallel write access to a file on a shared filesystem?",
    "answer": "Having any sort of parallel write access to a file stored on a shared filesystem (like home, scratch, and project) is likely to create problems unless a specialized tool such as MPI-IO is used."
