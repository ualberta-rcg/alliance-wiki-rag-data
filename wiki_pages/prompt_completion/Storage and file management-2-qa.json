  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the project storage space?",
    "answer": "The project space is primarily used for sharing data among members of a research group."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of data is best suited for storage in the project space?",
    "answer": "Data stored in the project space should be fairly static, meaning it is not likely to be changed many times in a month."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is project storage linked?",
    "answer": "Project storage is linked to a professor's account rather than an individual user."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is SCRATCH storage the best choice?",
    "answer": "SCRATCH is the best choice for intensive read/write operations on large files (greater than 100 MB per file)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are files stored in SCRATCH backed up?",
    "answer": "No, files stored in SCRATCH are not backed up, and important files must be copied off it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to older files in SCRATCH?",
    "answer": "Older files in SCRATCH are subject to purging."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of files should be stored in SCRATCH?",
    "answer": "SCRATCH should be used for temporary files like checkpoint files, job output, and other data that can easily be recreated."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should SCRATCH be considered normal storage?",
    "answer": "No, SCRATCH should not be regarded as normal storage; it is for transient files that you can afford to lose."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is `$SLURM_TMPDIR`?",
    "answer": "`$SLURM_TMPDIR` is an environment variable that holds a unique path to a temporary folder on a fast, local filesystem on each compute node allocated to a job."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are the contents of `$SLURM_TMPDIR` deleted?",
    "answer": "The directory and its contents are deleted when the job ends."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main advantage of using `$SLURM_TMPDIR`?",
    "answer": "The main advantage of using `$SLURM_TMPDIR` is increased performance due to the filesystem being local to the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what type of files is `$SLURM_TMPDIR` especially suited?",
    "answer": "`$SLURM_TMPDIR` is especially well-suited for large collections of small files (less than a few megabytes per file)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the `diskusage_report` command show individual user space usage on project filesystems?",
    "answer": "No, the `diskusage_report` command shows the total quota of the group on project, including all files from each group member, making it difficult to obtain correct per-user figures."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users estimate their space and file count usage on the entire project space?",
    "answer": "Users can obtain an estimate of their space and file count use on the entire project space by running the command `'lfs quota -u $USER /project'`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users estimate the number of files in a specific directory?",
    "answer": "Users can obtain an estimate for the number of files in a given directory (and its subdirectories) using the command `'lfs find <path to the directory> -type f | wc -l'`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a best practice for managing data in scratch and project spaces?",
    "answer": "Users should regularly clean up their data in the scratch and project spaces, because those filesystems are used for huge data collections."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommendation for text files regarding size?",
    "answer": "Only use text format for files that are smaller than a few megabytes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What locations are recommended for storing temporary files?",
    "answer": "As far as possible, use scratch and local storage for temporary files. For local storage, you can use the temporary directory created by the job scheduler named `$SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done with unused files that must be retained?",
    "answer": "If you no longer use certain files but they must be retained, archive and compress them, and if possible move them to an alternative location like nearline."
  },
  {
    "question": "What potential issues exist with parallel write access to shared filesystems?",
    "answer": "Having any sort of parallel write access to a file stored on a shared filesystem like home, scratch, and project is likely to create problems unless you are using a specialized tool such as MPI-IO."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted if current storage options do not meet specific needs?",
    "answer": "If your needs are not well served by the available storage options, you should contact technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default project space quota per group on the clusters?",
    "answer": "By default on our clusters, each group has access to 1 TB of project space."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can small increases in project and scratch spaces be obtained?",
    "answer": "Small increases in project and scratch spaces are available through the Rapid Access Service (RAS)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can larger increases in project spaces be obtained?",
    "answer": "Larger increases in project spaces are available through the annual Resource Allocation Competition (RAC)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command allows checking current quota usage on Cedar and Graham?",
    "answer": "You can see your current quota usage for various filesystems on Cedar and Graham using the command `'diskusage_report'`."
