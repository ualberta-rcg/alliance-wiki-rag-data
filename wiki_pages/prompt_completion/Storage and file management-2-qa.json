    "question": "What is the primary purpose of SCRATCH storage?",
    "answer": "SCRATCH storage is primarily used for intensive read/write operations on large files (over 100 MB per file) and should be used for temporary files like checkpoint files, output from jobs, and other data that can be easily recreated."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are files stored on SCRATCH backed up?",
    "answer": "No, important files must be copied off SCRATCH since they are not backed up there."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to older files on SCRATCH storage?",
    "answer": "Older files on SCRATCH storage are subject to purging."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should SCRATCH be considered normal long-term storage?",
    "answer": "No, SCRATCH should not be regarded as normal storage; it is intended for transient files that you can afford to lose."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of filesystem is NEARLINE storage?",
    "answer": "NEARLINE is a tape-based filesystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of data is suitable for NEARLINE storage?",
    "answer": "NEARLINE storage is intended for inactive data, specifically datasets that you do not expect to access for months."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `$SLURM_TMPDIR` environment variable used for?",
    "answer": "`$SLURM_TMPDIR` holds a unique path to a temporary folder on a fast, local filesystem on each compute node allocated to a job, used for files only needed during the job's duration."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are the contents of `$SLURM_TMPDIR` deleted?",
    "answer": "The directory and its contents in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` are deleted when the job ends."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an advantage of using `$SLURM_TMPDIR` compared to other networked filesystems?",
    "answer": "Its advantage is increased performance due to the filesystem being local to the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what kind of files is `$SLURM_TMPDIR` especially well-suited?",
    "answer": "`$SLURM_TMPDIR` is especially well-suited for large collections of small files (smaller than a few megabytes per file)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does `diskusage_report` show individual user space usage for project space?",
    "answer": "No, `diskusage_report` shows the total quota of the group on project, not the space and file count usage per user."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user estimate their space and file count usage on the entire project space?",
    "answer": "Users can obtain an estimate of their space and file count use on the entire project space by running the command `lfs quota -u $USER /project`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to estimate the number of files in a specific directory and its subdirectories?",
    "answer": "Users can obtain an estimate for the number of files in a given directory (and its subdirectories) using the command `lfs find <path to the directory> -type f | wc -l`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key best practice for managing data in scratch and project spaces?",
    "answer": "A key best practice is to regularly clean up your data in the scratch and project spaces, as these filesystems are used for huge data collections."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended method for safely deleting a set of files?",
    "answer": "To safely delete files, create a temporary directory `toDelete`, move the files to be deleted into it, verify the contents of `toDelete`, and then delete `toDelete` recursively."
  },
  {
    "question": "What characters should generally be avoided in `rm` commands?",
    "answer": "If possible, you should avoid using `*` and `/` characters in your `rm` commands."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to test environment variables used in `rm` commands within shell scripts?",
    "answer": "It is important to test environment variables in `rm` commands within shell scripts because empty or undefined variables can cause catastrophic errors, and any input value should be checked against malicious or erroneous use of the script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the guideline for using text format for files?",
    "answer": "Only use text format for files that are smaller than a few megabytes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should temporary files be stored, if possible?",
    "answer": "As far as possible, temporary files should be stored in scratch and local storage, such as the temporary directory created by the job scheduler, `$SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done with files that are no longer used but must be retained?",
    "answer": "If you no longer use certain files but they must be retained, you should archive and compress them, and if possible, move them to an alternative location like nearline storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can be a problem with parallel write access to files on shared filesystems?",
    "answer": "Having any sort of parallel write access to a file stored on a shared filesystem like home, scratch, and project is likely to create problems unless you are using a specialized tool such as MPI-IO."
