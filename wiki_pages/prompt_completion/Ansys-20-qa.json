    "question": "Is running Ansys GUI programs over SSH recommended or supported?",
    "answer": "No, running Ansys GUI programs over SSH is untested and unsupported, as it relies on a properly set up X display server or client emulator, and typically results in unacceptably slow interactive response times."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the startup time for Ansys GUI over SSH compare to VNC?",
    "answer": "In a test, starting the Ansys GUI over SSH took 40 minutes, while starting it with vncviewer took only 34 seconds."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances might using SSH for Ansys GUI still be considered?",
    "answer": "Despite the potential slowness, using SSH might be considered if the only goal is to open a simulation, perform basic menu operations, or run some calculations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the basic steps to attempt running Ansys GUI programs remotely over SSH?",
    "answer": "The basic steps are: 1) `ssh -Y username@graham.computecanada.ca`, 2) `salloc --x11 --time=1:00:00 --mem=16G --cpus-per-task=4 [--gpus-per-node=1] --account=def-mygroup`, and 3) once connected to a compute node, run `xclock` to verify the display before loading the Ansys module and running the program."

    "answer": "Allowed combinations include 1x512, 2x256, 4x128, or 8x64 jobs simultaneously across all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a job fails due to a shortage of SHARCNET licenses?",
    "answer": "Should a job fail on startup due to a license shortage, it will need to be manually resubmitted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What actions might be taken if frequent license shortages are reported with the SHARCNET license?",
    "answer": "If many license shortages are reported, the total job limit per researcher or the total HPC core limit per researcher may be decreased."
