    "question": "Where can I find the Release Highlights for Ansys Rocky 2024 R2 and 2025 R1?",
    "answer": "You can find the Release Highlights for Ansys Rocky 2024 R2 at https://innovationspace.ansys.com/knowledge/forums/topic/ansys-rocky-2024-r2-release-highlights/ and for 2025 R1 at https://innovationspace.ansys.com/knowledge/forums/topic/ansys-rocky-2025-r1-release-highlights/."

  {
    "question": "Are Ansys GUI programs supported when run remotely on a cluster compute node via SSH X forwarding?",
    "answer": "No, this approach is untested and unsupported as it relies on a properly set up X display server for your operating system or a suitable X client emulator package like MobaXterm."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the performance implications of running Ansys GUI programs over SSH compared to VNC?",
    "answer": "Interactive response times for basic menu tasks and graphics rendering are unacceptably slow over SSH. Startup times for GUI programs can also be very slow; for example, one test showed a 40-minute startup via SSH compared to 34 seconds with vncviewer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a basic starting point for running Ansys GUI programs over SSH?",
    "answer": "The basic steps are: 1) ssh -Y username@graham.computecanada.ca; 2) salloc --x11 --time=1:00:00 --mem=16G --cpus-per-task=4 [--gpus-per-node=1] --account=def-mygroup; 3) once connected, run `xclock` to test X forwarding, then load the desired Ansys module and try running the program."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can use the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET Ansys license is free for academic use by any Alliance researcher on any Alliance system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the usage restrictions for the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "It may be used for Publishable Academic Research but is strictly prohibited for any private or commercial purposes according to the license terms."
  },
  {
    "question": "What products are included in the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET Ansys license is based on the Multiphysics Campus Solution and includes products such as HF, EM, Electronics HPC, Mechanical, CFD, ROCKY, and LS-DYNA."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the SHARCNET license cover Lumerical or SpaceClaim?",
    "answer": "Lumerical is not currently covered by the SHARCNET license, even though the software is installed. SpaceClaim is technically covered, but it is not installed on Alliance systems since they are all Linux-based."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many anshpc licenses are available with the SHARCNET Ansys license, and what is their purpose?",
    "answer": "A pool of 1986 anshpc licenses is included with the SHARCNET license to support running large-scale parallel simulations with most Ansys products."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the CPU utilization requirement for parallel jobs using the SHARCNET license?",
    "answer": "Parallel jobs that do not achieve at least 50% CPU utilization will likely be flagged by the system, leading to a followup by an Alliance team member."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limits for simultaneous jobs and HPC cores per researcher with the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "Each researcher is permitted to run a maximum of 8 simultaneous jobs using up to 512 hpc cores. Examples of maximum even-sized combinations include 1x512, 2x256, 4x128, or 8x64 cores across all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a job fails due to a shortage of SHARCNET Ansys licenses?",
    "answer": "Should a job fail on startup due to a shortage of licenses, it will need to be manually resubmitted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What alternative options are available if a researcher needs more than 512 HPC cores?",
    "answer": "Researchers needing more than 512 HPC cores should consider using a local ANSYS License server at their institution, if available, and potentially contributing to its expansion."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of purchasing a license subscription from CMC for Ansys?",
    "answer": "Benefits include not needing a local institutional license server, avoiding yearly physical license reconfigurations, being able to use the license almost anywhere (home, institutions, Alliance clusters), and getting installation instructions for Windows machines to run SpaceClaim (which is not possible on Linux-based Alliance clusters)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a core limit for users with a CMC license subscription?",
    "answer": "According to the CMC Ansys Quick Start Guides, there may be a 64-core limit per user."
