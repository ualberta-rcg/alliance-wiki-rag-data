  {
    "question": "What happens when I run `cfx5-gui` on gra-vdi?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What are the available CFX programs that can be started in GUI mode via `cfx5-gui`?",
    "answer": "You can start CFX-Launcher, CFX-Pre, CFD-Post, or CFX-Solver."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to get started with Ansys Additive Manufacturing?",
    "answer": "To get started, configure your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file to point to a license server that has a valid Ansys Mechanical License on all systems where you plan to run the software."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I make the Ansys Additive Manufacturing ACT extension available in my project?",
    "answer": "You must download `AdditiveWizard.wbex` from `https://catalog.ansys.com/`, upload it to the cluster, then in the Workbench GUI, open your project, go to ACT Start Page -> Manage Extensions, and then install and load the extension."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I install the `AdditiveWizard.wbex` extension in Ansys Workbench?",
    "answer": "In the Extension Manager, click the box with the large '+' sign under the search bar, then navigate to select and install your `AdditiveWizard.wbex` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I load an Ansys Additive Manufacturing extension for both the current and future sessions?",
    "answer": "Click to highlight the `AdditiveWizard` box, then click the lower-right corner arrow in the box and select 'Load extension'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I unload an Ansys Additive Manufacturing extension so it doesn't load by default in future sessions?",
    "answer": "Click to un-highlight the `AdditiveWizard` box, then click the lower-right corner arrow in the box and select 'Do not load as default'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if Workbench gives warnings about un-needed extensions like ANSYSMotion?",
    "answer": "You should uninstall those un-needed extensions from your project."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the procedure to run a single Ansys Additive Manufacturing job on gra-vdi with up to 16 cores?",
    "answer": "Start Workbench on Gra-vdi, open `test.wbpj`, reset the workspace (if needed), start Mechanical, Clear Generated Data, tick 'Distributed', specify Cores, then click 'File -> Save Project -> Solve'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check the resource utilization of an Ansys Additive Manufacturing job running on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "You can open another terminal and run `top -u $USER` or `ps u -u $USER | grep ansys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to terminate rogue Ansys processes on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "You can run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE\"` to kill rogue processes from previous runs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might rogue processes be an issue with Ansys GUI programs on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Rogue processes can persistently tie up licenses or cause unusual errors if an Ansys GUI session is not cleanly terminated before vncviewer is disconnected, possibly due to network issues or hung filesystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What preparations are necessary before submitting a newly uploaded Additive project to a cluster queue?",
    "answer": "You must open your simulation with the Workbench GUI in the same directory as the job submission, save it again using the same Ansys module version, and then create a Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I enable parametric studies for an Additive project submitted to a cluster?",
    "answer": "To perform parametric studies, change `Update()` to `UpdateAllDesignPoints()` in the Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I avoid manually clearing the solution and recreating design points when testing an Additive project on a cluster?",
    "answer": "You can either change `Save(Overwrite=True)` to `Save(Overwrite=False)` in your Slurm script, or save a copy of the original `YOURPROJECT.wbpj` file and its corresponding `YOURPROJECT_files` directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check the resource utilization of an Additive job once it has been running on a cluster?",
    "answer": "You can obtain a snapshot of its resource utilization on the compute node(s) using the `srun` command: `srun --jobid=myjobid top -bn1 -u $USER | grep R | grep -v top`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should I perform scaling tests for an Additive job on a cluster?",
    "answer": "After a job completes, get its 'Job Wall-clock time' using `seff myjobid`. Then, submit short test jobs with an increasing number of cores, and if the Wall-clock time decreases by approximately 50% when the number of cores is doubled, consider using additional cores."
