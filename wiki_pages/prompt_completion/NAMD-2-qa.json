    "question": "What NAMD modules are typically used for GPU benchmarking simulations depending on the number of nodes?",
    "answer": "The NAMD multicore module is used for simulations that fit within one node, while the NAMD verbs-smp module is used for runs spanning multiple nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which single-node GPU configuration showed the fastest wall time per step in the provided benchmark table?",
    "answer": "A configuration using 32 cores and 2 GPUs on a single node achieved the fastest wall time per step at 0.0045 seconds."
  },
  {
    "question": "Based on the GPU benchmarking results, what is the most efficient configuration for a single node for this system?",
    "answer": "Using 1 GPU with 16 cores on a single node is identified as having the greatest efficiency for this system."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does using more than one node for GPU simulations always improve performance according to the benchmark?",
    "answer": "No, the benchmark results indicate that for the system tested, performance actually becomes worse when using 2 or more nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the cost-effectiveness of running NAMD with GPUs compare to non-GPU nodes on Graham, based on the example?",
    "answer": "Using a full GPU node on Graham (32 cores, 2 GPUs) is faster than running on four non-GPU nodes, and since a GPU node costs about twice a non-GPU node, it is more cost-effective to run with GPUs in this scenario."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the status of NAMD 3.0.1 installation on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3.0.1 is currently installed as a module on Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can NAMD 3.0.1 offer performance advantages over NAMD 2.14?",
    "answer": "Yes, NAMD 3.0.1 might offer better performance than NAMD 2.14 for certain system configurations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are needed to run a newer NAMD version downloaded directly from the NAMD website on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "To run a newer version, you need to extract the downloaded binary (`tar xvfz`), navigate to its directory (`cd`), and then execute `setrpaths.sh --path .` to link the `namd3` executable to the correct system libraries."
  },
  {
    "question": "What configuration change is highly recommended for best NAMD 3 GPU performance?",
    "answer": "For best NAMD 3 GPU performance, it is highly recommended to add `GPUresident on;` to the NAMD input file, provided the input configuration supports it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more details about the `GPUresident` parameter in NAMD 3?",
    "answer": "More information about the `GPUresident` parameter and related changes in NAMD 3 can be found on the NAMD 3.0 Alpha web page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users download NAMD software and what is required?",
    "answer": "Users can download NAMD software from http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=NAMD, but registration is required to download the software."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are user guides and release notes available for NAMD versions 3.0.1 and 2.14?",
    "answer": "Yes, user guides and release notes are available for both NAMD version 3.0.1 and version 2.14."
