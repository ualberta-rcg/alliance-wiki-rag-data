    "question": "What is the recommended maximum number of cores for NAMD CPU jobs, considering queue times?",
    "answer": "For the specific system benchmarked, it is acceptable to use up to 256 cores. However, using more cores can lead to longer wait times in the queue, affecting overall throughput."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD module should be used for GPU simulations that fit within a single node?",
    "answer": "The NAMD multicore module is used for GPU simulations that fit within one node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD module should be used for GPU simulations that span multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "The NAMD verbs-smp module is used for GPU simulations that span multiple nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Based on the GPU benchmarking results, is it beneficial to use more than one node for the system tested?",
    "answer": "No, for the system benchmarked, performance actually becomes worse if two or more nodes are used, indicating no benefit."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most efficient single-node GPU configuration for the benchmarked system, and what is an acceptable alternative for quicker results?",
    "answer": "Using 1 GPU with 16 cores (1GPU/16 core) offers the greatest efficiency for single-node GPU runs. Using 2 GPUs with 32 cores (2GPU/32 core) is also acceptable if you need to obtain results quickly."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are priority charges handled for NAMD GPU jobs on Graham GPU nodes?",
    "answer": "On Graham GPU nodes, your priority is charged the same for any job using up to 16 cores and 1 GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it more cost-effective to run NAMD with or without GPUs on Graham for the benchmarked system?",
    "answer": "It is more cost-effective to run with GPUs. A full GPU node on Graham (32 cores, 2 GPUs) runs faster than four non-GPU nodes, and while a GPU node costs about twice a non-GPU node, it is still more efficient."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the general advice for choosing between GPU and non-GPU jobs, considering queue times?",
    "answer": "You should run with GPUs if possible. However, given that there are fewer GPU nodes than CPU nodes, you may need to consider submitting non-GPU jobs if your waiting time for GPU jobs is too long."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is NAMD 3.0.1 available as a module?",
    "answer": "Yes, NAMD 3.0.1 is installed as a module."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does NAMD 3.0.1's performance compare to NAMD 2.14?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3.0.1 might offer better performance than NAMD 2.14 for certain system configurations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I run a newer version of NAMD that is not yet installed as a module on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "You can download the binary from the NAMD website, extract it (`tar xvfz NAMD_3.0alpha11_Linux-x86_64-multicore-CUDA-SingleNode.tar.gz`), navigate to its directory (`cd NAMD_3.0alpha11_Linux-x86_64-multicore-CUDA`), and then link it to the correct libraries using `setrpaths.sh --path .`"
  },
  {
    "question": "What keyword is highly recommended to add to the configuration file for best NAMD 3 performance on GPUs?",
    "answer": "For best performance of NAMD 3 on GPUs, it is highly recommended to add `GPUresident on;` to the configuration file, if the input configuration supports it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more details about the `GPUresident on;` parameter and NAMD 3 changes?",
    "answer": "More information on this parameter and related changes in NAMD 3 can be found on the NAMD 3.0 Alpha web page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is registration required to download NAMD software?",
    "answer": "Yes, registration is required to download the NAMD software."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the NAMD User's guide for version 3.0.1?",
    "answer": "The NAMD User's guide for version 3.0.1 can be found at `https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/3.0.1/ug/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the NAMD version 3.0.1 release notes?",
    "answer": "The NAMD version 3.0.1 release notes are available at `http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/3.0.1/notes.html`."
