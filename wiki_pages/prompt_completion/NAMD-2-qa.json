  {
    "question": "What is the acceptable number of cores to use for the system benchmarked in the CPU performance table?",
    "answer": "For the system benchmarked, it is acceptable to use up to 256 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the consequence of requesting too many cores for a NAMD job?",
    "answer": "If you ask for too many cores, your jobs will wait in the queue for a longer time, affecting your overall throughput."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD module is used for GPU simulations that fit within a single node, and which for runs spanning multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "The NAMD multicore module is used for simulations that fit within one node, while the NAMD verbs-smp module is used for runs spanning nodes when performing GPU benchmarking."
  },
  {
    "question": "For the benchmarked system, what is the most efficient configuration when running NAMD GPU simulations on a single node?",
    "answer": "Using only 1 node, it is best to use 1 GPU with 16 cores for the greatest efficiency, but using 2 GPUs with 32 cores is also acceptable if results are needed quickly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does using more than one node improve GPU performance for the benchmarked system?",
    "answer": "No, for this specific system, performance actually becomes worse if we use 2 or more nodes for GPU simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it more cost-effective to run NAMD with or without GPUs on Graham for the benchmarked simulation?",
    "answer": "It is more cost-effective to run with GPUs because a full GPU node on Graham (32 cores, 2 GPUs) runs faster than 4 non-GPU nodes, and a GPU node costs about twice what a non-GPU node costs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances might a user consider submitting non-GPU jobs, even if GPUs are more cost-effective?",
    "answer": "Users may need to consider submitting non-GPU jobs if their waiting time for GPU jobs is too long, given that there are fewer GPU than CPU nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of NAMD 3 is currently installed as a module?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3.0.1 is currently installed as a module."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does NAMD 3.0.1 always offer better performance than NAMD 2.14?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3.0.1 might offer better performance than NAMD 2.14 for certain system configurations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user prepare a downloaded NAMD 3 binary to run on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "After extracting the tarball (e.g., `tar xvfz NAMD_3.0alpha11_Linux-x86_64-multicore-CUDA-SingleNode.tar.gz`) and navigating into the directory, run `setrpaths.sh --path .` to link the `namd3` executable to the correct libraries."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a highly recommended keyword to add to the configuration file for best NAMD 3 performance on GPUs?",
    "answer": "It is highly recommended to add `GPUresident on;` to the configuration file for best NAMD 3 performance on GPUs, if the input configuration supports it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more information about the `GPUresident` parameter in NAMD 3?",
    "answer": "Users can find more information about the `GPUresident` parameter and related changes in NAMD 3 on the NAMD 3.0 Alpha web page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one download NAMD software?",
    "answer": "NAMD software can be downloaded from http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=NAMD, though registration is required."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the NAMD User's guide for version 3.0.1?",
    "answer": "The NAMD User's guide for version 3.0.1 is available at https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/3.0.1/ug/."
