    "question": "How can you submit a job requesting a single Volta GPU on Graham?",
    "answer": "You can submit a job for a single Volta GPU using a Slurm script, for example, with `#SBATCH --account=def-someuser`, `#SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:1`, `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=3`, `#SBATCH --mem=12G`, and `#SBATCH --time=1-00:00`, loading `arch/avx512 StdEnv/2018.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the Slurm directives for a job requesting an entire Volta GPU node on Graham?",
    "answer": "To request an entire Volta GPU node, use Slurm directives such as `#SBATCH --account=def-someuser`, `#SBATCH --nodes=1`, `#SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100:8`, `#SBATCH --exclusive`, `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=28`, `#SBATCH --mem=150G`, and `#SBATCH --time=1-00:00`, loading `StdEnv/2023`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the `$SLURM_TMPDIR` environment variable on Graham's Volta nodes?",
    "answer": "The `$SLURM_TMPDIR` environment variable indicates the location of a temporary directory on the fast local disk, which should be used if the task requires many I/O operations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the files stored in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` when a job finishes?",
    "answer": "All files contained in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` are deleted automatically when the task is completed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Python virtual environments be created in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` on Graham?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can create Python virtual environments in this temporary space to improve efficiency."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request Turing GPU nodes on Graham?",
    "answer": "To request Turing GPU nodes, you should specify `--gres=gpu:t4:2` in your job script, for example, to get two T4 cards per node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request Ampere GPU nodes on Graham?",
    "answer": "To obtain Ampere GPU nodes, you need to specify `--gres=gpu:a100:2` or `--gres=gpu:a5000:2` in your job script, requesting two Ampere cards per node in these examples."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did the capacity of Graham begin to be reduced?",
    "answer": "The capacity of Graham started to be limited on January 13, 2025."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the new capacity limit for Graham?",
    "answer": "The capacity of Graham will be limited to approximately 25%."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is Graham's capacity being reduced?",
    "answer": "Graham's capacity is being reduced until the new Nibi system becomes available."
