    "question": "Who must request access to computational resources offered by the Alliance?",
    "answer": "Both the PI (Principal Investigator) and any sponsored user that needs those resources must first request access."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users request access to desired Alliance computational systems?",
    "answer": "Users must request access on the page: https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a user fails to request access to a desired system?",
    "answer": "If this step is missed, users will not be able to log in to the desired system."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there additional requirements for accessing some Alliance computational systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, some systems will require the acceptance of additional agreements (e.g., Terms of User, SLAs, etc.) before access can be granted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do PIs and sponsored users get initial storage resources?",
    "answer": "Some storage resources are made available in the Default RAP immediately after creating an Alliance account on CCDB and requesting access to the corresponding system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum amount of additional project storage a PI can request without a RAC application?",
    "answer": "PIs can request up to a maximum of 40 TB of project storage in any General Purpose cluster without submitting a RAC application."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum amount of additional nearline storage a PI can request without a RAC application?",
    "answer": "PIs can request up to a maximum of 100 TB of nearline storage in any General Purpose cluster without submitting a RAC application."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can additional storage resources be split across multiple General Purpose clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, these resources can be requested all in one cluster or split across multiple ones, but the total amount across all clusters must not exceed 40 TB of project storage or 100 TB of nearline storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which HPC clusters do not offer RAS storage?",
    "answer": "Trillium and HPSS do not have RAS storage available."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is eligible to request storage resources via RAS (Resource Allocation System)?",
    "answer": "Only PIs (Principal Investigators), not sponsored users, are eligible to request storage resources via RAS."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a PI request storage resources via RAS?",
    "answer": "PIs must send an email to support@tech.alliancecan.ca with details of the storage resources needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are CPU resources generally made available to research groups with an active Alliance account?",
    "answer": "CPU resources are available for 'opportunistic use' to all research groups with an active Alliance account."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the average CPU resource usage expected for research groups with a Default RAP on each cluster?",
    "answer": "Research groups may be able to use, on average, up to 200 core years on each cluster with their Default RAP."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the 200 core years for CPU resources a fixed reservation or cap?",
    "answer": "No, 200 core years is a variable target; it is not a reservation nor a cap."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might applying for a RAC be the best option for CPU resources?",
    "answer": "Applying for a RAC may be the best option for jobs with large memory requirements or if the amount of CPU resources needed exceeds the minimum required to apply."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more information about how jobs are scheduled and CPU usage is charged?",
    "answer": "Users can find more information by reading about 'Allocations and compute scheduling'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are GPU resources available for opportunistic use?",
    "answer": "Yes, GPU resources are available for opportunistic use to all research groups with an active Alliance account."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does the availability of GPU resources fluctuate?",
    "answer": "The availability of GPU resources varies greatly over the year due to increasing demand, becoming more limited in periods preceding major conferences."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the Alliance guarantee a specific amount of GPU resources for opportunistic use?",
    "answer": "No, the Alliance cannot guarantee any amount of resources available to each group for opportunistic use, especially during times of high demand."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users ensure consistent access to GPU resources?",
    "answer": "Users with a RAC (Resource Allocation Project) award should be able to consistently use their allocated amount."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can PIs request access to cloud resources?",
    "answer": "PIs must complete a specific Google Form with details about the cloud resources needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can be granted access to cloud resources?",
    "answer": "Access can be granted to PIs and also to other users with an Alliance account."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the contact email for questions or help regarding RAS cloud resources?",
    "answer": "For questions or help regarding RAS cloud resources, users should contact cloud@tech.alliancecan.ca."
