  {
    "question": "If I have a VASP version 4 license, can I use version 5?",

    "question": "If I have a VASP version 6 license, which other versions can I use?",
    "answer": "If you are licensed for VASP version 6, you may also use versions 5 and 4."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I find available VASP versions on Graham and Cedar?",
    "answer": "You can run `module spider vasp` to see which versions are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I load a specific version of VASP and its dependencies on Graham and Cedar?",
    "answer": "First, run `module spider vasp/<version>` to see dependencies, then load them along with the VASP module, for example: `module load intel/2020.1.217 intelmpi/2019.7.217 vasp/5.4.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find information on using VASP on Niagara?",
    "answer": "To use VASP on Niagara, please refer to the SciNet VASP wiki page at [https://docs.scinet.utoronto.ca/index.php/VASP SciNet VASP wiki page]."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are GPU versions of VASP available on Niagara?",
    "answer": "No, Niagara nodes do not have GPUs, so GPU versions of VASP are not available on that system."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are VASP pseudopotential files located on Cedar and Graham?",
    "answer": "All pseudopotential files are located in `$EBROOTVASP/pseudopotentials/` on Cedar and Graham, and can be accessed once the VASP module is loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the executable files for VASP-4.6?",
    "answer": "For VASP-4.6, the executable files are `vasp` for standard NVT calculations with non-gamma k points, `vasp-gamma` for standard NVT calculations with only gamma points, and `makeparam` to estimate memory requirements."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which executable is used for standard NVT calculations with non-gamma k points in VASP-5.4.1?",
    "answer": "For VASP-5.4.1, `vasp_std` is used for standard NVT calculations with non-gamma k points."
  },
  {
    "question": "What executable is used for NPT calculations with non-gamma k points in VASP versions without CUDA support?",
    "answer": "For VASP-5.4.1, 5.4.4, and 6.1.0 (without CUDA support), `vasp_ncl` is used for NPT calculations with non-gamma k points."
  },
  {
    "question": "What executable is used for standard NVT calculations with CUDA support for VASP-5.4.4?",
    "answer": "For VASP-5.4.4 and 6.1.0 (with CUDA support), `vasp_gpu` is used for standard NVT calculations with gamma and non-gamma k points."
  },
  {
    "question": "What extensions are incorporated into VASP?",
    "answer": "Two extensions incorporated into VASP are Transition State Tools and VASPsol."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended when running Vasp-GPU executable files?",
    "answer": "It is highly recommended to perform a benchmark using one or two GPUs to ensure maximum performance, as GPU calculations are more expensive than CPU calculations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much better is the performance of Vasp-GPU with one or two GPUs compared to CPU-only?",
    "answer": "Benchmarks show that performance for GPU=1,2 and CPU=1 is more than 5 times better compared to GPU=0 and CPU=1."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a significant performance gain from using two GPUs instead of one for Vasp-GPU?",
    "answer": "A comparison indicates there is not much performance gain from GPU=1 to GPU=2, with GPU=2 use being around 50% in the monitoring system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example of a Slurm job script for a CPU-only VASP job?",
    "answer": "A CPU-only VASP job script using Slurm typically includes `#SBATCH` directives for account, number of MPI tasks, memory per CPU, and time, followed by `module load` commands for VASP and its dependencies, and `srun <VASP>` to execute."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPU cores and memory does the example CPU VASP job script request?",
    "answer": "The example CPU VASP job script requests four CPU cores and 4096MB memory (4x1024MB)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the common VASP input files?",
    "answer": "VASP uses four input files named INCAR, KPOINTS, POSCAR, and POTCAR."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should VASP input files be organized for a job?",
    "answer": "It is best to prepare VASP input files in a separate directory for each job."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you submit a VASP job script?",
    "answer": "To submit a VASP job from the directory containing the input files and job script, use `sbatch vasp_job.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I estimate the memory needed for a VASP job if I don't know it?",
    "answer": "You can prepare all input files and then run `makeparam` in an interactive job submission to estimate the required memory. For future jobs, check the maximum stack size used by completed jobs."
