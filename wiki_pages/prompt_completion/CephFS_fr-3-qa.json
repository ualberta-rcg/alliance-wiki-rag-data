  },
  {
    "question": "How do you permanently mount a CephFS device on an Arbutus instance using fstab?",
    "answer": "To permanently mount a CephFS device on an Arbutus instance, add the line `:/volumes/_nogroup/f6cb8f06-f0a4-4b88-b261-f8bd6b03582c /cephfs/ ceph name=MyCephFS-RW 0  2` to the `/etc/fstab` file."

  {
    "question": "Is the colon character before the device path in the fstab an error?",
    "answer": "No, the colon character `:` before the device path in fstab is not a typo; it is a non-standard but intentional part of the configuration."

  {
    "question": "Are CephFS mount options the same for all systems?",
    "answer": "No, CephFS mount options differ depending on the system. For instance, the `namespace` option is required for SD4H/Juno, while other options are for performance adjustments."

  {
    "question": "How do you mount a CephFS device directly from the command line on an Arbutus instance?",
    "answer": "You can mount a CephFS device on an Arbutus instance using the command `sudo mount -t ceph :/volumes/_nogroup/f6cb8f06-f0a4-4b88-b261-f8bd6b03582c /cephfs/ -o name=MyCephFS-RW`."

    "question": "What command is used to install the ceph-fuse library?",
    "answer": "The `ceph-fuse` library can be installed using the command `sudo dnf install ceph-fuse`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you enable ceph-fuse mounts to be available in a user's space?",
    "answer": "To make `ceph-fuse` mounts available in a user's space, uncomment the `user_allow_other` line in the `fuse.conf` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you mount CephFS in your home directory using ceph-fuse?",
    "answer": "First, create a directory like `mkdir ~/my_cephfs`, then use the command `ceph-fuse my_cephfs/ --id=MyCephFS-RW --conf=~/ceph.conf --keyring=~/ceph.keyring --client-mountpoint=/volumes/_nogroup/f6cb8f06-f0a4-4b88-b261-f8bd6b03582c`."

  {
    "question": "Can a particular CephFS share have multiple user keys?",
    "answer": "Yes, a particular CephFS share can have multiple user keys, which allows for more precise access to the file system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of having multiple user keys for a CephFS share?",
    "answer": "Multiple user keys enable more precise access control, for example, allowing some hosts to access the file system in read-only mode."
