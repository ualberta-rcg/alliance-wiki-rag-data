    "question": "What is NAMD?",
    "answer": "NAMD is an object-oriented molecular dynamics software designed for simulating large biomolecular systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What software is used to prepare and analyze NAMD simulations?",
    "answer": "Simulations are prepared and analyzed using the visualization software VMD."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is NAMD software typically installed?",
    "answer": "The NAMD software is installed by our technical team and is available via modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted for questions regarding NAMD installation or a need for a newer version?",
    "answer": "You should contact technical support if you need a newer version, need to do the installation yourself, or have questions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most recent version of NAMD available on the clusters?",
    "answer": "The most recent version available on all clusters is 3.0.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can NAMD version 2.14 be used with H100 GPUs?",
    "answer": "No, NAMD version 2.14 cannot be used with H100 GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which cluster is the GPU version of NAMD exclusively available?",
    "answer": "The GPU version can only be used on Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "What technology should be used for NAMD tasks executed on multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "For tasks executed on multiple nodes, UCX should be used."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find information about the Slurm scheduler?",
    "answer": "Information on the Slurm scheduler is available on the 'Running jobs' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one increase the number of cores used for a sequential NAMD simulation?",
    "answer": "To use more cores for a sequential NAMD simulation, increase the value of `--cpus-per-task` in the script, without exceeding the number of cores available on the node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are required to run NAMD version 3.0.1 in a sequential job script?",
    "answer": "For NAMD version 3.0.1, load `StdEnv/2023`, `gcc/12.3`, and `namd-multicore/3.0.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are required to run NAMD version 2.14 in a sequential job script?",
    "answer": "For NAMD version 2.14, load `StdEnv/2020` and `namd-multicore/2.14`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended `--ntasks-per-node` value for UCX NAMD tasks on B\u00e9luga to achieve the best performance?",
    "answer": "For UCX NAMD tasks on B\u00e9luga, `--ntasks-per-node` should be 40, as NAMD tasks using entire nodes offer the best performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Slurm options are shown in the UCX parallel CPU job example for a 2-node job?",
    "answer": "The example uses `--nodes=2`, `--ntasks-per-node=40`, and `--mem=0`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the necessary modules for NAMD 3.0.1 with UCX in a parallel CPU job?",
    "answer": "Load the modules `StdEnv/2023`, `gcc/13.3`, and `namd-ucx/3.0.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you execute NAMD 3 in a UCX parallel CPU job script?",
    "answer": "Execute NAMD 3 using `srun --mpi=pmi2 namd3 apoa1.namd`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What new input parameter is available in NAMD 3 to improve GPU performance, and how is it used?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3 offers the `GPUresident on;` input parameter, which can significantly improve performance by directing more calculations to the GPU. To use it, add this line to your input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Slurm option requests one P100 GPU per node in the single GPU task example?",
    "answer": "The `--gpus-per-node=p100:1` Slurm option requests one P100 GPU per node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are loaded for NAMD 3.0.1 in a single GPU job script?",
    "answer": "For NAMD 3.0.1 with a single GPU, load `StdEnv/2023`, `gcc/12.3`, `cuda/12.2`, and `namd-multicore/3.0.1`."
  },
