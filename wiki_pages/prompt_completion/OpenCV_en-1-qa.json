  {
    "question": "What is OpenCV?",
    "answer": "OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does OpenCV support CUDA?",
    "answer": "Yes, OpenCV is also available with CUDA."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the OpenCV module with CUDA support?",
    "answer": "You can load the OpenCV module with CUDA by running `module load gcc cuda opencv/X.Y.Z`, where X.Y.Z is the desired version."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the OpenCV module include extra modules?",
    "answer": "Yes, the module also contains the extra modules, often referred to as 'contrib' modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does OpenCV provide Python bindings?",
    "answer": "Yes, the OpenCV module contains bindings for multiple Python versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I find out which Python versions are compatible with a specific OpenCV module version?",
    "answer": "To discover compatible Python versions, run `module spider opencv/X.Y.Z` or `module spider opencv_python/X.Y.Z`, replacing X.Y.Z with the desired version."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules should be loaded to use OpenCV with Python?",
    "answer": "To use OpenCV with Python, you need to load `gcc`, `opencv/X.Y.Z` (the desired version), `python`, and `scipy-stack`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you import OpenCV in a Python script?",
    "answer": "After loading the necessary modules, you can import OpenCV in Python by running the command `python -c \"import cv2\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I know if the OpenCV import in Python was successful?",
    "answer": "If the command `python -c \"import cv2\"` displays nothing, the import was successful."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the different Python packages provided by OpenCV?",
    "answer": "OpenCV provides four different Python packages: `opencv_python`, `opencv_contrib_python`, `opencv_python_headless`, and `opencv_contrib_python_headless`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does loading the `opencv` module help with Python package dependencies?",
    "answer": "With the `opencv` module loaded, your package dependency for one of the OpenCV Python packages will be satisfied."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you enable OpenCV to read EXR files?",
    "answer": "To read EXR files with OpenCV, the module must be activated by setting the environment variable `OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR=1` before executing your Python script, for example, `OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR=1 python <file>`."
