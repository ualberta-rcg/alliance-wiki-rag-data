    "question": "How do you simulate a quantum circuit with CirQ?",
    "answer": "You can simulate a circuit using `cirq.Simulator().run(circuit, repetitions=...)`, where `circuit` is the quantum circuit to simulate and `repetitions` specifies how many times to run it."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many repetitions are used for the circuit simulation in the example?",
    "answer": "The example simulates the circuit 1000 times by setting `repetitions=1000` in the `cirq.Simulator().run()` call."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you retrieve the histogram of measurement results from a CirQ simulation?",
    "answer": "After a simulation, the histogram of results for a specific measurement key can be obtained using `s.histogram(key='m')`, where `s` is the simulation result object and `'m'` is the key for the measurement."
  },
  {
    "question": "What function is used to plot a state histogram from CirQ simulation results?",
    "answer": "The `cirq.plot_state_histogram(counts, plt.subplot())` function is used to plot the state histogram from the simulation `counts`, typically in conjunction with `matplotlib.pyplot`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Python library is imported for plotting purposes in the given example for CirQ results?",
    "answer": "The `matplotlib.pyplot` library is imported as `plt` for plotting purposes in the example."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the image 'Bell Graph CirQ.png' represent?",
    "answer": "The image 'Bell Graph CirQ.png' represents a diagram of the result of 1000 simulations of the Bell state."
