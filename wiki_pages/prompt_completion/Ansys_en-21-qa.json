    "question": "What preparations are required before submitting a newly uploaded Ansys Additive project to a cluster queue?",
    "answer": "Before submitting an Additive project to a cluster queue, you must open the simulation with the Workbench GUI in the job submission directory, save it again using the same Ansys module version, and then create a Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I perform parametric studies with an Ansys Additive project using a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "To perform parametric studies, you need to change the `Update()` command to `UpdateAllDesignPoints()` within your Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the methods to avoid manually clearing solution data and recreating design points between test runs in Ansys Additive projects?",
    "answer": "To avoid manually clearing solution data, either change `Save(Overwrite=True)` to `Save(Overwrite=False)` in your Slurm script, or save a copy of the original `YOURPROJECT.wbpj` file and its corresponding `YOURPROJECT_files` directory and restore them after each run."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I manually run a replay file for an Ansys Additive project on a cluster?",
    "answer": "You can manually run a replay file by loading the Ansys module (e.g., `module load ansys/2019R3`), removing any lock files (e.g., `rm -f test_files/.lock`), and then executing `runwb2 -R myreplay.wbjn`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a single replay file be used in different directories for Ansys Additive projects?",
    "answer": "A single replay file can be used in different directories by opening it in a text editor and changing its internal `FilePath` setting."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I check the resource utilization of an Ansys Additive job running on a cluster?",
    "answer": "After your additive job has been running for a few minutes, you can obtain a snapshot of its resource utilization using the command: `srun --jobid=myjobid top -bn1 -u $USER | grep R | grep -v top`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are scaling tests performed for Ansys Additive jobs?",
    "answer": "Scaling tests are performed by first obtaining the \"Job Wall-clock time\" using `seff myjobid`. Then, submit several short test jobs with an increasing number of cores and observe if the Wall-clock time decreases, ideally by approximately 50% when the number of cores is doubled."
  },
  {
    "question": "What indicates that additional cores might be beneficial for scaling an Ansys Additive job?",
    "answer": "If the \"Job Wall-clock time\" decreases by approximately 50% when the number of cores is doubled, it suggests that additional cores may be beneficial for scaling."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find publicly accessible online documentation for the latest Ansys release?",
    "answer": "A publicly accessible online version of the Ansys Help site, including full Documentation, Tutorials, and Videos for the LATEST Ansys release, is available at [https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/prod_page.html?pn=Fluent&pid=Fluent&lang=en](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/prod_page.html?pn=Fluent&pid=Fluent&lang=en)."

  {
    "question": "Is Ansys developer documentation available without requiring a login?",
    "answer": "Yes, developer documentation is available without login at [https://developer.ansys.com/docs](https://developer.ansys.com/docs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Ansys versions require a login to access their online documentation?",
    "answer": "Documentation for Ansys versions 2024R1, 2024R2, and 2025R1 requires a login and can be accessed at [https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/](https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find documentation for Ansys Multiphysics System Coupling, and does it require a login?",
    "answer": "Documentation for Multiphysics System Coupling versions 2023R1 through 202R2 is available at [https://ansysapi.ansys.com](https://ansysapi.ansys.com) and requires a login."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I access Ansys Help for specific versions (e.g., 2023R2) without needing to log in?",
    "answer": "To access Ansys Help for specific versions without login: Connect to gra-vdi.computecanada.ca with tigervnc, close Firefox or Ansys Workbench if open, start Firefox, open a new terminal, start Workbench with `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys; runwb2`, click `Help -> ANSYS Workbench Help` in Workbench, close Workbench, click `HOME` on the Ansys documentation page, then scroll down to select a product and use the `Release Year` pull-down to change the version."
