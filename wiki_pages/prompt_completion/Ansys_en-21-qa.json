    "question": "What preparations are needed before submitting a new Ansys Additive project to a cluster queue?",
    "answer": "You must first open the simulation with the Workbench GUI in the same directory from which the job will be submitted, save it again using the same Ansys module version, and then create a Slurm script as explained in the 'Cluster Batch Job Submission - WORKBENCH' section."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you submit a prepared Ansys Additive project to a cluster queue?",
    "answer": "Submit the job using the `sbatch scriptname` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can parametric studies be performed using an Ansys Additive project's Slurm script?",
    "answer": "To perform parametric studies, change `Update()` to `UpdateAllDesignPoints()` in the Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What methods can be used to avoid manually clearing solutions and recreating design points between test runs for Ansys Additive projects?",
    "answer": "To avoid this, either change `Save(Overwrite=True)` to `Save(Overwrite=False)` in the Slurm script, or save a copy of the original YOURPROJECT.wbpj file and its corresponding YOURPROJECT_files directory and restore them after each solution is written."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an Ansys Workbench replay file be used on a cluster for Additive projects?",
    "answer": "A replay file can be optionally created and manually run on the cluster in the respective test case directory between runs. It can also be used in different directories by opening it in a text editor and changing its internal FilePath setting."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example command sequence for running an Ansys Workbench replay file on a cluster?",
    "answer": "After loading the `ansys/2019R3` module, you can run `rm -f test_files/.lock` to remove lock files, then execute `runwb2 -R myreplay.wbjn`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check the resource utilization of an Ansys Additive job on cluster compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Once your additive job has been running for a few minutes, you can obtain a snapshot of its resource utilization using the `srun --jobid=myjobid top -bn1 -u $USER | grep R | grep -v top` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are scaling tests performed for an Ansys Additive job?",
    "answer": "After a job completes, its 'Job Wall-clock time' is obtained from `seff myjobid`. Scaling tests involve submitting several short test jobs with an increasing number of cores and observing if the Wall-clock time decreases proportionally."
  },
  {
    "question": "What indicates that additional cores might be beneficial for an Ansys Additive job during scaling tests?",
    "answer": "If the 'Job Wall-clock time' decreases by approximately 50% when the number of cores is doubled, additional cores may be considered."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find the publicly accessible online Ansys Help site for the latest release?",
    "answer": "A publicly accessible online version of the Ansys Help site with full documentation, tutorials, and videos for the LATEST Ansys release version is available at [https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/prod_page.html?pn=Fluent&pid=Fluent&lang=en]."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is a login required to access Ansys developer documentation?",
    "answer": "No, developer documentation is available at [https://developer.ansys.com/docs] without login."
  },
  {
    "question": "For which Ansys versions is a login required to access their documentation?",
    "answer": "A login is required to access documentation for Ansys versions 2024R1, 2024R2, and 2025R1."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can documentation for Multiphysics System Coupling (versions 2023R1 through 202R2) be found, and is a login necessary?",
    "answer": "Documentation for Multiphysics System Coupling versions 2023R1 through 202R2 is available at [https://ansysapi.ansys.com], and a login will be required to access it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to access Ansys Help for a specific version like 2023R2 without requiring a login?",
    "answer": "1) Connect to `gra-vdi.computecanada.ca` with TigerVNC. 2) Close Firefox or Ansys Workbench if open. 3) Start Firefox. 4) Open a new terminal. 5) Start Workbench by typing `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys; runwb2`. 6) In Workbench, click `Help -> ANSYS Workbench Help`. 7) Close Workbench. 8) On the Ansys documentation page, click `HOME`. 9) Scroll down to select a product and view its documentation, then change the version using the `Release Year` pull-down."
