  {
    "question": "What preparations are needed before submitting an Additive project to a cluster queue?",
    "answer": "Before submitting, open your simulation with Workbench GUI in the same directory, save it using the correct Ansys module version, and then create a Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure a Slurm script to perform parametric studies for an Additive project?",
    "answer": "Change 'Update()' to 'UpdateAllDesignPoints()' in the Slurm script to perform parametric studies."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you determine the optimal number of cores and memory for an Additive job?",
    "answer": "Determine the optimal number of cores and memory by submitting several short test jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are two ways to avoid manually clearing the solution and recreating design points between test runs in Workbench?",
    "answer": "Either change 'Save(Overwrite=True)' to 'Save(Overwrite=False)' in the Slurm script or save a copy of the original YOURPROJECT.wbpj file and its corresponding YOURPROJECT_files directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a replay file be used on a cluster for an Additive project?",
    "answer": "A replay file can be manually run on the cluster in the respective test case directory between runs, and its internal FilePath setting can be changed in a text editor to be used in different directories."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to run a replay file in Workbench?",
    "answer": "Use 'module load ansys/2019R3; rm -f test_files/.lock; runwb2 -R myreplay.wbjn' to run a replay file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check the resource utilization of an Additive job on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Once your additive job has been running for a few minutes, a snapshot of its resource utilization can be obtained with 'srun --jobid=myjobid top -bn1 -u $USER | grep R | grep -v top'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you perform scaling tests for an Additive job?",
    "answer": "After a job completes, obtain its 'Job Wall-clock time' using 'seff myjobid', then submit short test jobs with an increasing number of cores. If the Wall-clock time decreases by ~50% when cores are doubled, consider additional cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find publicly accessible online documentation for the latest Ansys release?",
    "answer": "A publicly accessible online version of the Ansys Help site with full Documentation, Tutorial and Videos for the LATEST Ansys release version is available at https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/public/account/secured?returnurl=/Views/Secured/prod_page.html?pn=Fluent&pid=Fluent&lang=en."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is developer documentation for Ansys available without login?",
    "answer": "Yes, developer documentation is available at https://developer.ansys.com/docs without login."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to log in to access documentation for Ansys versions 2024R1, 2024R2, and 2025R1?",
    "answer": "Yes, you will need to log in to access documentation for Ansys versions 2024R1, 2024R2, and 2025R1 at https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I access Ansys Help for versions like 2023R2 without logging in?",
    "answer": "Connect to gra-vdi.computecanada.ca with tigervnc, close Firefox and Ansys Workbench if open, start Firefox, open a new terminal, load 'CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys' and run 'runwb2', then click 'Help -> ANSYS Workbench Help' in Workbench's menu bar."
