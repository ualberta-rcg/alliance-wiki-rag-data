    "question": "What happens if a user requests a total of 100 TB of storage, split as 50 TB of project storage and 50 TB of nearline storage on Fir?",
    "answer": "This request is eligible because the project storage request meets the minimum requirement, even though the nearline amount is below its individual minimum. Both requests should be included in the application."

  {
    "question": "How should a user request 100 VCPU of compute cloud resources on Arbutus with 5 TB of Volume and snapshot storage and 5 TB of object storage?",

  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances would a CPU request for 250 core-years, split across Fir (100 cores) and Nibi (150 cores), be rejected?",
    "answer": "This request will not be accepted because the individual CPU amounts on Fir and Nibi are below the minimum eligible for RAC, and the CPU might be available without a RAC allocation. If this is the only request, the application will be disqualified."
