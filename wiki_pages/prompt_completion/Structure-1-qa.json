  {
    "question": "What is Structure software used for?",
    "answer": "Structure is a free software package for using multilocus genotype data to investigate population structure, including inferring distinct populations, assigning individuals, studying hybrid zones, identifying migrants, and estimating population allele frequencies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of genetic markers can Structure be applied to?",
    "answer": "It can be applied to most commonly-used genetic markers, including SNPS, microsatellites, RFLPs, and AFLPs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who authored the 2000 paper on population structure inference using multilocus genotype data?",
    "answer": "J.K. Pritchard, M. Stephens, and P. Donnelly authored the paper published in Genetics, 155:945\u2013959, 2000."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage for the Structure software?",
    "answer": "The Structure Homepage is http://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure.html."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of Structure is installed at the time of writing this document?",
    "answer": "Structure v2.3.4 has been installed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the module name for Structure v2.3.4?",
    "answer": "The module name is `structure/2.3.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can an up-to-date list of installed Structure versions be found?",
    "answer": "An up-to-date list of installed versions can be found on the page [[Available software]] for the module `structure`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What files does 'structure' expect to find in the current working directory when started without command-line options?",
    "answer": "It expects to find `mainparams`, `extraparams`, and a data file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the data file name be specified when running 'structure'?",
    "answer": "The name of the data file can be set using the 'INFILE' parameter in `mainparams` or supplied via the command line with the `-i` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find a complete description of 'structure' parameters and file-formats?",
    "answer": "Users should refer to \u00a77 'Running ''structure'' from the command line' in the Structure Documentation for version 2.3.4."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command-line options are available for 'structure' to supply alternative filenames?",
    "answer": "Examples include `-m` for mainparams, `-e` for extraparams, `-i` for input file, and `-o` for output file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `structure_job.sh` script example?",
    "answer": "It provides an example submission script for running Structure jobs, typically in a Slurm environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does Structure itself support parallel execution?",
    "answer": "No, Structure in itself is not able to run in parallel."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are StrAuto and StructureHarvester useful for Structure analysis?",
    "answer": "Because population structure inference using the Evanno-method involves multiple Structure runs, StrAuto and StructureHarvester have been developed to automate the process and aggregate results, respectively."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is StrAuto used for?",
    "answer": "StrAuto is used for the automation and parallelization of STRUCTURE analysis, specifically for setting up multiple Structure runs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is StructureHarvester used for?",
    "answer": "StructureHarvester is used for aggregating the results from multiple Structure runs, visualizing STRUCTURE output, and implementing the Evanno method."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage URL for StrAuto?",
    "answer": "The StrAuto Homepage is https://vc.popgen.org/software/strauto/."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage URL for StructureHarvester?",
    "answer": "The StructureHarvester Homepage is http://alumni.soe.ucsc.edu/~dearl/software/structureHarvester/."
