    "question": "What are Meltdown and Spectre?",
    "answer": "Meltdown and Spectre are bugs related to speculative execution in various CPU architectures developed over the past ten to fifteen years, particularly affecting Intel and AMD processors, including those on Compute Canada clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which CPU processors are primarily affected by Meltdown and Spectre?",
    "answer": "Processors from Intel and AMD are particularly affected by Meltdown and Spectre."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find a detailed discussion about Meltdown and Spectre?",
    "answer": "A detailed discussion of Meltdown and Spectre can be found on the Arstechnica page linked in the document."
  },
  {
    "question": "What actions has Compute Canada taken regarding systems vulnerable to Meltdown and Spectre?",
    "answer": "Compute Canada personnel have patched systems deemed sensitive to these vulnerabilities."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was required to patch the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "Updating the operating system and rebooting the nodes was required to patch the vulnerabilities."
  },
  {
    "question": "How were compute nodes updated for the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "For compute nodes, updates were typically done in a rolling fashion, were largely transparent to users, and are now complete."
  },
  {
    "question": "When were updates applied at Graham for these vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "Updates were applied at Graham between 2018 January 5 and January 31, with most nodes updated by January 13."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the range of potential performance impacts cited for the operating system patches?",
    "answer": "Performance impacts cited range from very minimal to alarming figures of up to a 30% or even 50% performance hit."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which types of tasks are most heavily affected by the security patches?",
    "answer": "Tasks which involve a lot of input/output (reading and writing files), such as databases or file transfers (e.g., rsync), seem to be most heavily affected."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are high performance computing jobs significantly affected by the security patches?",
    "answer": "Most high performance computing jobs should be minimally affected since the vast majority of the run time is spent computing rather than doing input and output."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do different processor generations respond to the security patches in terms of performance?",
    "answer": "Different processor generations are affected to different degrees, with the most notable performance degradation reported for older processors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Compute Canada's ongoing policy regarding new patches for these vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "Compute Canada has patched all vulnerable equipment and will apply new patches if and when vendors release them."
  },
  {
    "question": "What assurance does Compute Canada provide regarding system security for these vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "Compute Canada team members are taking every action possible to ensure that the systems they run are secure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is responsible for updating virtual machines running on the Compute Canada Cloud for security patches?",
    "answer": "If you are operating your own virtual machine in the Compute Canada cloud, you are responsible for updating its operating system to include the latest security patches."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should users do if they believe their application's performance is severely impacted by the security patches?",
    "answer": "Users who believe their application may be severely impacted by the security patches should contact the Compute Canada Technical Support team."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information should users provide when contacting technical support about potential performance impacts?",
    "answer": "Users are encouraged to bring forward comparative performance numbers of their application, such as job run times before and after the announcement of the patches."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it always possible to mitigate the performance impact of the security patches?",
    "answer": "Mitigating the performance impact of the security patches is likely to require some modification to the code and may not always be possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find specific instructions for updating Linux VMs on the Compute Canada Cloud?",
    "answer": "Specific instructions for updating Linux VMs can be found under 'Security_considerations_when_running_a_VM#Updating_your_VM'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find links to recent performance comparisons related to these patches?",
    "answer": "Links to some recent performance comparisons can be found in the References section of the document."
