  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to consult with technical staff before submitting a RAC application?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is strongly recommended that all applicants consult with technical staff responsible for the clusters they intend to use. This ensures the technical aspects of the proposals match well with the requested clusters, especially for PIs who have not previously used the clusters. Consultations should occur in advance of completing the proposal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted if an applicant doesn't know the appropriate technical staff for consultation?",
    "answer": "If you do not know the appropriate technical staff to contact for consultation, you should email allocations@tech.alliancecan.ca."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a researcher apply to the Resource Allocation Competition (RAC)?",
    "answer": "Any researcher interested in applying to the RAC must be registered with the CCDB. All applications must be submitted electronically through the CCDB\u2019s Resource Allocation Competition page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a researcher apply to both the Resources for Research Groups (RRG) and Research Platforms and Portals (RPP) processes?",
    "answer": "Yes, a PI can apply as a lead submitter for only one RRG application but can be involved in multiple RRG submissions as a participant. PIs may simultaneously hold lead positions on one or several RPP projects, but still only one RRG project."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the Canadian Common CV (CCV) required for a RAC application?",
    "answer": "Yes, PIs and all Co-PIs of a RAC application are required to submit a CCV. This integration into the CCDB helps standardize CVs and assists Scientific Review Committees in evaluating the research team's quality."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can Co-PIs update their Canadian Common CV (CCV) on the CCDB?",
    "answer": "Co-PIs can update their CCV by clicking on the 'Update CCV' button in the Resource Applications page, or by going to 'My Account' \u2192 'View Reporting' on the CCDB. The status will automatically update in the RAC online application form."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a glossary available for technical terms or acronyms used in RAC documentation?",
    "answer": "Yes, a list of key terms used in the competition and application process is available. Applicants should consult the Technical Glossary when preparing their application."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will a project be at a disadvantage if it does not fully rely on existing ARC infrastructure?",
    "answer": "The RAC only grants access to ARC infrastructure. If you have questions about whether the infrastructure you are using is part of the national platform, you should contact allocations@tech.alliancecan.ca."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can academic PIs with small research teams or limited funding still apply to the RAC?",
    "answer": "Yes, academic PIs can apply for an allocation regardless of the size of their research team or the funding they have received."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are extensions possible for RAC application submission deadlines?",
    "answer": "No, the submission deadline for RAC applications is final. There will be no extensions, and late submissions will not be accepted. Concerns can be directed to allocations@tech.alliancecan.ca."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are applicants typically notified about the results of their RAC application?",
    "answer": "All applicants will be notified of their competition results in March via email. A list of recipients, project allocation amounts, and allocation values will be published on the RAC Annual Reports page after private notifications."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the monetary value of RAC allocations determined?",
    "answer": "The monetary value assigned to each allocation represents an average across all facilities and includes the total capital and operational costs incurred by the Federation to deliver the resources and associated services. These are not commercial or market values and cannot be used as a match for a CFI award."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might a final allocation be less than requested, even after explaining the impact of a reduction?",
    "answer": "Each year, the infrastructure is heavily oversubscribed. A scaling function is applied to compute requests to enable allocation decisions when there is insufficient capacity, which can lead to a final allocation being less than requested."
