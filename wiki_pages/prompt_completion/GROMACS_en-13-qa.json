    "question": "What modules are necessary to install gmx_MMPBSA for GROMACS 2021 under the StdEnv/2020 environment?",
    "answer": "To install gmx_MMPBSA for GROMACS 2021 with StdEnv/2020, you need to load the following modules: `StdEnv/2020`, `gcc/9.3.0`, `python/3.8`, `gromacs/2021.4`, and `ambertools/21`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you set up a virtual environment for gmx_MMPBSA when using GROMACS 2021 and StdEnv/2020?",
    "answer": "After loading the required modules, you create a virtual environment with `virtualenv venv_gmxMMPBSA` and then activate it using `source venv_gmxMMPBSA/bin/activate`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the pip commands for installing gmx_MMPBSA and its specific dependencies for GROMACS 2021?",
    "answer": "First, update pip using `pip install -U pip`, then install the packages with `pip install --no-index numpy==1.22.2 seaborn==0.13.1 gmx_MMPBSA==1.5.0.3 ParmEd==3.4.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should the Qt/PyQt module be loaded during the gmx_MMPBSA installation process for GROMACS 2021?",
    "answer": "The Qt/PyQt module (`module load qt/5.15.2`) should be loaded after the virtual environment has been created and is ready."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you verify that the gmx_MMPBSA application is working correctly after installation?",
    "answer": "You can test if gmx_MMPBSA works by running `gmx_MMPBSA -h` or `gmx_MMPBSA_test -ng -n 4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it acceptable to run gmx_MMPBSA self-tests on the login node?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is permissible to run the gmx_MMPBSA self-tests on the login node because they are very quick."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should modules be loaded and the virtual environment activated when running a gmx_MMPBSA job later with GROMACS 2021 in StdEnv/2020?",
    "answer": "For a gmx_MMPBSA job, you should `module purge`, then `module load StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 python/3.8 ambertools/21 gromacs/2021.4 qt/5.15.2`, and finally `source venv_gmxMMPBSA/bin/activate`."
