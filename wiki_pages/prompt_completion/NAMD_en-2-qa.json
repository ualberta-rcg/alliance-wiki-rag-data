    "question": "What is the wall time per step for a NAMD simulation using 4 cores and 1 GPU on a single node?",
    "answer": "The wall time per step for this configuration is 0.0165 seconds."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which configuration offers the greatest efficiency for NAMD simulations on a single node for the described system?",
    "answer": "Using 1 GPU and 16 cores on a single node offers the greatest efficiency."
  },
  {
    "question": "What NAMD configuration is recommended for quick results on a single node, even if not the most efficient?",
    "answer": "Using 2 GPUs and 32 cores on a single node is acceptable for getting results quickly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does NAMD performance improve when using more than one node for the system detailed in the benchmark table?",
    "answer": "No, for this particular system, performance actually becomes worse when using 2 or more nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the speed of a NAMD job on a full Graham GPU node compare to non-GPU nodes?",
    "answer": "A NAMD job using a full GPU node of Graham (32 cores, 2 GPUs) runs faster than it would on 4 non-GPU nodes of Graham."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it more cost-effective to run NAMD with or without GPUs on Graham, given the cost difference?",
    "answer": "It is more cost-effective to run with GPUs, as a GPU node on Graham costs about twice what a non-GPU node costs but offers better performance for this system."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might a user choose to submit a non-GPU NAMD job even if GPU jobs are more cost-effective?",
    "answer": "Users may need to consider submitting non-GPU jobs if the waiting time for GPU jobs is too long, as there are fewer GPU nodes available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the latest version of NAMD that is installed as a module?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3.0.1 is currently installed as a module."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user manually install and prepare a newer NAMD binary downloaded from the NAMD website to run on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "After downloading and extracting the binary (e.g., `tar xvfz NAMD_3.0alpha11_Linux-x86_64-multicore-CUDA-SingleNode.tar.gz`), change to the extracted directory and run `setrpaths.sh --path .` to link it to the correct libraries."
  },
  {
    "question": "What keyword should be added to the NAMD configuration file for best performance of NAMD 3 on GPUs?",
    "answer": "Add the keyword `GPUresident on;` to the NAMD configuration file for best performance on GPUs, if the input configuration supports it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find the NAMD User's guide for version 3.0.1?",
    "answer": "The NAMD User's guide for version 3.0.1 is available at `https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/3.0.1/ug/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is registration required to download NAMD software from the official website?",
    "answer": "Yes, registration is required to download the NAMD software."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the charging policy on Graham GPU nodes for NAMD jobs using up to 16 cores and 1 GPU?",
    "answer": "On Graham GPU nodes, the priority is charged the same for any NAMD job using up to 16 cores and 1 GPU."
