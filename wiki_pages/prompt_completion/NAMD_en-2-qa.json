  {
    "question": "Where can users find a Molecular Dynamics Performance Guide for Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "A team at ACENET has created a Molecular Dynamics Performance Guide for Alliance clusters, available at [https://mdbench.ace-net.ca/mdbench/ Molecular Dynamics Performance Guide]."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the Molecular Dynamics Performance Guide?",
    "answer": "It can help you determine optimal conditions for AMBER, GROMACS, NAMD, and OpenMM jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it useful to benchmark NAMD for a particular system?",
    "answer": "Performance of NAMD will differ depending on the number of atoms in the simulation, so benchmarking is very useful if you plan to spend a significant amount of time simulating a particular system."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is benchmarking data helpful when applying for a RAC award?",
    "answer": "Yes, collecting and providing this kind of data is very useful if you are applying for a RAC award."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the guidelines for conducting a good NAMD benchmark regarding simulation duration?",
    "answer": "For a good benchmark, vary the number of steps so that your system runs for a few minutes, and that timing information is collected in reasonable time intervals of at least a few seconds to avoid fluctuations."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which cluster were the NAMD benchmarking numbers for the apoa1 benchmark obtained?",
    "answer": "The benchmarking was conducted on the Graham cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What NAMD version and module were used for the initial CPU benchmarking results?",
    "answer": "NAMD 2.12 from the verbs module was used."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is efficiency calculated in NAMD benchmarking?",
    "answer": "Efficiency is computed from (time with 1 core) / (N * (time with N cores) )."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the acceptable maximum number of cores for the NAMD apoa1 benchmark system, according to the CPU benchmarking results?",
    "answer": "For this system, it is acceptable to use up to 256 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What impact does requesting too many cores have on job throughput?",
    "answer": "If you ask for more cores, your jobs will wait in the queue for a longer time, affecting your overall throughput."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD module is used for GPU simulations that fit within a single node?",
    "answer": "The NAMD multicore module is used for simulations that fit within 1 node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD module is used for GPU simulations that span multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "The NAMD verbs-smp module is used for runs spanning nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "For the apoa1 GPU benchmark, is it beneficial to use more than one node?",
    "answer": "No, there is no point at all in using more than 1 node for this system, since performance actually becomes worse if we use 2 or more nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is considered the most efficient configuration for the apoa1 GPU benchmark when using only one node?",
    "answer": "Using only 1 node, it is best to use 1GPU/16 core as that has the greatest efficiency."
  },
  {
    "question": "When comparing GPU and non-GPU options for the apoa1 benchmark on Graham, which is more cost-effective?",
    "answer": "It is more cost effective to run with GPUs, as a full GPU node runs faster than 4 non-GPU nodes, and a GPU node costs about twice what a non-GPU node costs."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might users consider submitting non-GPU jobs despite GPUs being more cost-effective?",
    "answer": "Users may need to consider submitting non-GPU jobs if their waiting time for GPU jobs is too long, given that there are fewer GPU than CPU nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is NAMD 3.0.1 available as a module?",
    "answer": "Yes, NAMD 3.0.1 is now installed as a module."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does NAMD 3.0.1 performance compare to NAMD 2.14?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3.0.1 might offer better performance than NAMD 2.14 for certain system configurations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user run a newer NAMD version that is not yet installed as a module on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "Users can download the binary from the NAMD website, extract it, navigate to the directory, and run `setrpaths.sh --path .` to link it to the correct libraries."
  },
  {
    "question": "What keyword is highly recommended for best NAMD 3 performance on GPUs?",
    "answer": "For best performance of NAMD 3 on GPUs, adding the keyword `GPUresident on;` to the configuration file is highly recommended if the input configuration supports it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more details about the `GPUresident on;` parameter and NAMD 3 changes?",
    "answer": "More details can be found on the NAMD 3.0 Alpha web page."
