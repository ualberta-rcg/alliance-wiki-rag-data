    "question": "What considerations are necessary when using the multi-node GPU job script on clusters other than Narval?",
    "answer": "To use the script on other clusters, you should look up the specifications of their available nodes and adjust the `--cpus-per-task` and `--gpus-per-node` options accordingly."

  },
  {
    "question": "Why does NAMD's performance vary for different simulations?",
    "answer": "Performance of NAMD will be different for different systems you are simulating, depending especially on the number of atoms in the simulation."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it particularly useful to conduct NAMD benchmarking?",
    "answer": "It is very useful to conduct NAMD benchmarking if you plan to spend a significant amount of time simulating a particular system, or if you are applying for a RAC award."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommendations for a good NAMD benchmark run?",
    "answer": "For a good benchmark, vary the number of steps so that your system runs for a few minutes, and that timing information is collected in reasonable time intervals of at least a few seconds."
  },
  {
    "question": "What could happen if a NAMD benchmark run is too short?",
    "answer": "If your run is too short, you might see fluctuations in your timing results."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which cluster was the standard NAMD apoa1 benchmark conducted, and what were its node specifications?",
    "answer": "The benchmarking was conducted on the Graham cluster, which has CPU nodes with 32 cores and GPU nodes with 32 cores and 2 GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What NAMD version and module were used for the CPU core benchmarking results in the first table?",
    "answer": "NAMD 2.12 from the verbs module was used."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is efficiency calculated in the NAMD benchmarking results?",
    "answer": "Efficiency is computed from (time with 1 core) / (N * (time with N cores))."
  },
  {
    "question": "Based on the CPU benchmarking results for the apoa1 system, what is an acceptable maximum number of cores to use?",
    "answer": "For this system, it is acceptable to use up to 256 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a potential trade-off when requesting a high number of cores for NAMD jobs?",
    "answer": "If you ask for more cores, your jobs will wait in the queue for a longer time, affecting your overall throughput."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD module is used for GPU simulations that fit within one node versus those spanning multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "NAMD multicore module is used for simulations that fit within 1 node, and NAMD verbs-smp module is used for runs spanning nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the GPU benchmarking table, what is the wall time per step for a single node with 32 cores and 2 GPUs?",
    "answer": "The wall time per step is 0.0045 seconds for a single node with 32 cores and 2 GPUs (multicore)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the GPU benchmarking results suggest about using more than one node for this system?",
    "answer": "There is no point in using more than 1 node for this system, since performance actually becomes worse if we use 2 or more nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "For single-node GPU jobs, which configuration offers the greatest efficiency, and which is acceptable for quick results?",
    "answer": "For single-node GPU jobs, 1 GPU/16 cores has the greatest efficiency, but 2 GPUs/32 cores is acceptable if you need to get your results quickly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it more cost-effective to run this simulation with or without GPUs on Graham, considering the node costs?",
    "answer": "It is more cost-effective to run with GPUs for this simulation, as a full GPU node runs faster than four non-GPU nodes, even though a GPU node costs about twice what a non-GPU node costs."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might it be necessary to submit non-GPU jobs even if GPUs offer better performance?",
    "answer": "You may need to consider submitting non-GPU jobs if your waiting time for GPU jobs is too long, given that there are fewer GPU than CPU nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the status of NAMD 3.0.1 regarding installation as a module?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3.0.1 is now installed as a module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a potential benefit of NAMD 3.0.1 compared to NAMD 2.14?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3.0.1 might offer better performance than NAMD 2.14 for certain system configurations."

  {
    "question": "How can a user try a newer version of NAMD if it's available on the website but not yet as a module on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "Users can download the binary from the NAMD website and modify it to run on Alliance systems using specific `tar`, `cd`, and `setrpaths.sh` commands."
  },
  {
    "question": "What keyword is highly recommended for best NAMD 3 performance on GPUs, and where should it be added?",
    "answer": "The keyword `GPUresident on;` is highly recommended for best NAMD 3 performance on GPUs and should be added to the NAMD input configuration file if supported."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find tutorials for NAMD?",
