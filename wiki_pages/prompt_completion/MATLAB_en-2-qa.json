  {
    "question": "How do you compile a MATLAB script named `cosplot.m` using the `mcc` command?",
    "answer": "You would use the command `mcc -m -R -nodisplay cosplot.m` to compile the script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What files are generated after compiling a MATLAB script with `mcc`?",
    "answer": "Compiling a MATLAB script with `mcc` produces a binary executable file and a wrapper script."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which script should be used to run a compiled MATLAB binary on the servers, and why?",
    "answer": "You should use the provided `run_mcr_binary.sh` script to run the binary because the default wrapper script generated by `mcc` won't work on the servers due to incorrect library path assumptions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to load an MCR module for MATLAB version R2024b?",
    "answer": "The command is `module load mcr/R2024b`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command needs to be run once for each compiled binary to set correct paths?",
    "answer": "The `setrpaths.sh --path <binary_name>` command needs to be run once for each compiled binary."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is MATLAB Parallel Server recommended?",
    "answer": "MATLAB Parallel Server is only worthwhile if you need more workers in your parallel MATLAB job than the available CPU cores on a single compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum number of workers a regular MATLAB installation can support for parallel jobs within a single node?",
    "answer": "A regular MATLAB installation allows you to run parallel jobs within one node with up to 64 workers per job."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it currently possible to submit MATLAB Parallel Server jobs from a local computer?",
    "answer": "No, as of May 2023, job submission from a local computer for MATLAB Parallel Server is no longer possible due to security improvements and MATLAB's use of an unsupported SSH mode, with no current workaround."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the Slurm plugin for MATLAB still work?",
    "answer": "No, the Slurm plugin for MATLAB no longer works because it is unavailable and due to the described SSH issue preventing job submission."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find official MATLAB documentation?",
    "answer": "Official MATLAB documentation is available at https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/."
  },
  {
