    "question": "What types of storage options are provided to users?",
    "answer": "A wide range of storage options are provided, including high-speed temporary local storage and different kinds of long-term storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should filesystems be used responsibly?",
    "answer": "Filesystems are a shared resource, and unwise behavior can negatively affect dozens or hundreds of other users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of files are the filesystems designed to store?",
    "answer": "The filesystems are designed to store a limited number of very large files, typically binary files that are hundreds of MB or more."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of files should users avoid storing, especially in the same directory?",
    "answer": "Users should avoid storing tens of thousands of small files, where small means less than a few megabytes, particularly in the same directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended approach for handling a directory with many small files?",
    "answer": "A better approach is to use commands like `tar` or `zip` to convert a directory containing many small files into a single very large archive file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the user's responsibility regarding the age of stored data?",
    "answer": "It is the user's responsibility to manage the age of stored data, as most filesystems are not intended to provide an indefinite archiving service."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do with files or directories that are no longer needed?",
    "answer": "When a given file or directory is no longer needed, the user needs to move it to a more appropriate filesystem, which may include a personal workstation or another storage system under their control."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tool should generally be used for moving significant amounts of data between systems?",
    "answer": "Moving significant amounts of data between your workstation and one of our systems or between two of our systems should generally be done using Globus."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the storage systems meant for personal use?",
    "answer": "No, our storage systems are not for personal use and should only be used to store research data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What will a user's home directory contain when an account is created on a cluster?",
    "answer": "It will contain references to your scratch and project spaces through symbolic links."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a symbolic link in the context of file systems?",
    "answer": "A symbolic link is a kind of shortcut that allows easy access to other filesystems from a user's home directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long might it take for symbolic links to scratch and project spaces to appear in a home directory?",
    "answer": "These symbolic links may appear up to a few hours after you first connect to the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference in ownership between home/scratch spaces and project space?",
    "answer": "While home and scratch spaces are unique to an individual user, the project space is shared by a research group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who typically constitutes a research group that shares project space?",
    "answer": "A research group may consist of individuals with an account sponsored by a particular faculty member or members of an RAC allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are symbolic links to different project spaces located in a user's home directory?",
    "answer": "Symbolic links to different project spaces are located in the `projects` directory within a user's home directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the default project determined for users with more than one active sponsored role?",
    "answer": "For users with more than one active sponsored role, the default project corresponds to the default project of the faculty member with the most sponsored accounts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command-line utility is available to check disk space and utilization?",
    "answer": "All users can check the available disk space and current disk utilization for the project, home, and scratch filesystems with the command line utility `diskusage_report`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you use the `diskusage_report` utility?",
    "answer": "To use this utility, log into the cluster using SSH, at the command prompt type `diskusage_report`, and press the Enter key."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more detailed disk usage output than `diskusage_report` provides?",
    "answer": "More detailed output is available using the Diskusage Explorer tool."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics of the HOME filesystem regarding quotas and performance?",
    "answer": "The HOME directory normally has a relatively small quota and doesn't have especially good performance for writing and reading large amounts of data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most logical use for a user's home directory?",
    "answer": "The most logical use of a home directory is typically for source code, small parameter files, and job submission scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the primary characteristics and advantages of the PROJECT space?",
    "answer": "The project space has a significantly larger quota, is well adapted for sharing data among research group members, and is linked to a professor's account rather than an individual user."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of data is suitable for storage in the PROJECT space?",
    "answer": "The data stored in the project space should be fairly static, meaning the data are not likely to be changed many times in a month."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should frequently changing data be avoided in the PROJECT space?",
    "answer": "Frequently changing data, including just moving and renaming directories, in project can become a heavy burden on the tape-based backup system."
