    "question": "What kind of storage options are available to users?",
    "answer": "We provide a wide range of storage options, from high-speed temporary local storage to different kinds of long-term storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the filesystems on the systems shared among users?",
    "answer": "Yes, in most cases, the filesystems on our systems are a shared resource."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to use shared filesystems responsibly?",
    "answer": "Unwise behavior on shared filesystems can negatively affect dozens or hundreds of other users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended file size and type for storage on these filesystems?",
    "answer": "These filesystems are designed to store a limited number of very large files, typically binary, which are hundreds of MB or more."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of files should users avoid storing, especially in the same directory?",
    "answer": "Users should avoid storing tens of thousands of small files, where small means less than a few megabytes, particularly in the same directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users manage a directory containing many small files efficiently?",
    "answer": "A better approach is to use commands like `tar` or `zip` to convert a directory containing many small files into a single very large archive file."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the filesystems intended for indefinite data archiving?",
    "answer": "No, most of the filesystems are not intended to provide an indefinite archiving service."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done with files or directories that are no longer needed on the system?",
    "answer": "When a given file or directory is no longer needed, you need to move it to a more appropriate filesystem, such as your personal workstation or some other storage system under your control."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which tool should be used for moving large amounts of data between systems?",
    "answer": "Moving significant amounts of data between your workstation and one of our systems or between two of our systems should generally be done using Globus."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose for using these storage systems?",
    "answer": "Our storage systems are not for personal use and should only be used to store research data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What will a user find in their home directory upon account creation?",
    "answer": "Upon account creation, your home directory will contain references to your scratch and project spaces through symbolic links."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a symbolic link in the context of file systems?",
    "answer": "A symbolic link is a kind of shortcut that allows easy access to other filesystems from your home directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long might it take for symbolic links to appear after connecting to a cluster?",
    "answer": "These symbolic links may appear up to a few hours after you first connect to the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which storage spaces are unique to an individual user, and which are shared?",
    "answer": "Your home and scratch spaces are unique to you as an individual user, while the project space is shared by a research group."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a research group for a project space typically defined?",
    "answer": "A research group may consist of individuals with an account sponsored by a particular faculty member or members of a RAC allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can an individual user access multiple project spaces?",
    "answer": "Yes, a given individual may have access to several different project spaces."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are the symbolic links to different project spaces located within a user's home directory?",
    "answer": "Symbolic links to different project spaces are found in the `projects` directory within your home directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the default project determined for users with a single active sponsored role?",
    "answer": "For users with a single active sponsored role, the default project is the default project of their sponsor."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the default project determined for users with multiple active sponsored roles?",
    "answer": "Users with more than one active sponsored role will have a default project that corresponds to the default project of the faculty member with the most sponsored accounts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What utility can users use to check disk space and utilization for project, home, and scratch filesystems?",
    "answer": "All users can check the available disk space and current disk utilization for the project, home, and scratch filesystems with the command line utility `diskusage_report`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you use the `diskusage_report` utility?",
    "answer": "To use `diskusage_report`, log into the cluster using SSH, type `diskusage_report` at the command prompt, and press the Enter key."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more detailed disk usage output?",
    "answer": "More detailed output is available using the Diskusage Explorer tool."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended uses for the HOME directory?",
    "answer": "The most logical use of your home directory is typically source code, small parameter files, and job submission scripts, as it has a relatively small quota and isn't ideal for large data R/W."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics and intended uses of the PROJECT space?",
    "answer": "The project space has a significantly larger quota, is well adapted for sharing data among research group members, is linked to a professor's account, and is best for fairly static data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should data in the PROJECT space be fairly static?",
    "answer": "Frequently changing data, including moving and renaming directories, in the project space can become a heavy burden on the tape-based backup system."
