    "question": "What types of storage solutions are offered to users?",
    "answer": "We provide a wide range of storage options, from high-speed temporary local storage to different kinds of long-term storage, to suit diverse needs and usage patterns."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should filesystems on the systems be used responsibly?",
    "answer": "Filesystems are a shared resource, and unwise behavior can negatively affect dozens or hundreds of other users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of files are the filesystems designed to store?",
    "answer": "These filesystems are designed to store a limited number of very large files, which are typically binary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should users avoid storing on the filesystems, especially in the same directory?",
    "answer": "Users should avoid storing tens of thousands of small files (less than a few megabytes), particularly in the same directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended approach for managing a directory containing many small files?",
    "answer": "A better approach is to use commands like `tar` or `zip` to convert a directory containing many small files into a single very large archive file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the user's responsibility regarding the age of their stored data?",
    "answer": "It is your responsibility to manage the age of your stored data; when a file or directory is no longer needed, you must move it to a more appropriate filesystem, such as your personal workstation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which tool is generally recommended for moving significant amounts of data between systems?",
    "answer": "Moving significant amounts of data between your workstation and one of our systems or between two of our systems should generally be done using Globus."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of these storage systems?",
    "answer": "Our storage systems are not for personal use and should only be used to store research data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What will a user's home directory contain when an account is first created on a cluster?",
    "answer": "It will contain references to your scratch and project spaces through symbolic links, which are shortcuts for easy access to these other filesystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long after first connecting to a cluster might symbolic links appear in the home directory?",
    "answer": "These symbolic links may appear up to a few hours after you first connect to the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who shares the project space?",
    "answer": "The project space is shared by a research group."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a research group defined for project space access?",
    "answer": "A research group may consist of individuals with an account sponsored by a particular faculty member or members of an RAC allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can an individual user have access to multiple project spaces?",
    "answer": "Yes, a given individual may have access to several different project spaces, associated with one or more faculty members, with symbolic links in the `projects` directory of their home."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a user's default project determined if they have only one active sponsored role?",
    "answer": "For users with a single active sponsored role, their default project is that of their sponsor."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a user's default project determined if they have more than one active sponsored role?",
    "answer": "Users with more than one active sponsored role will have a default project that corresponds to the default project of the faculty member with the most sponsored accounts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command-line utility allows users to check disk space and utilization for project, home, and scratch filesystems?",
    "answer": "All users can check the available disk space and the current disk utilization for the project, home, and scratch filesystems with the command line utility `diskusage_report`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do users run the `diskusage_report` utility?",
    "answer": "To use this utility, log into the cluster using SSH, at the command prompt type `diskusage_report`, and press the Enter key."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more detailed disk usage information?",
    "answer": "More detailed output is available using the Diskusage Explorer tool."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics and recommended uses for the HOME filesystem?",
    "answer": "The home directory typically has a relatively small quota and isn't ideal for large data operations; its most logical use is for source code, small parameter files, and job submission scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics and recommended uses for the PROJECT filesystem?",
    "answer": "The project space has a significantly larger quota, is well adapted for sharing data among research group members, and the data stored should be fairly static."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important for data in the PROJECT space to be fairly static?",
    "answer": "Frequently changing data, including just moving and renaming directories, in project can become a heavy burden on the tape-based backup system."
