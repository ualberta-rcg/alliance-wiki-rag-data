    "question": "What is the purpose of Minimac3?",
    "answer": "Minimac3 is an implementation of genotype imputation algorithms designed for lower memory usage and improved computational efficiency, especially with very large reference panels, while maintaining accuracy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of Minimac3 is available?",
    "answer": "Minimac3 version 2.0.1 is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Minimac4?",
    "answer": "Minimac4 is the latest version in the series of genotype imputation software, following Minimac3, Minimac2, minimac, and MaCH. It offers lower memory usage and greater computational efficiency compared to its predecessors, with comparable imputation quality."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of minimap2?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 is a fast sequence mapping and alignment program used to find overlaps between long noisy reads, or to map long reads or their assemblies to a reference genome, optionally with detailed CIGAR alignments."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the performance characteristics of minimap2?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 works efficiently with query sequences from a few kilobases to ~100 megabases in length at an error rate of ~15%. It is over 20 times faster than most other long-read aligners on limited test data sets and is intended to replace BWA-MEM for long reads and contig alignment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What output formats does minimap2 support?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 outputs in the PAF or the SAM format."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is MinPath used for?",
    "answer": "MinPath (Minimal set of Pathways) is a parsimony approach designed for biological pathway reconstructions using protein family predictions, providing a more conservative and faithful estimation of biological pathways for a given dataset."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is MiXCR?",
    "answer": "MiXCR is a universal framework for processing large immunome data from raw sequences to quantitated clonotypes. It efficiently handles paired- and single-end reads, manages sequence quality, corrects PCR errors, and identifies germline hypermutations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of MiXCR are available?",
    "answer": "MiXCR versions 4.1.2 and 4.7.0 are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is MLIP software used for?",
    "answer": "MLIP is a software for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who developed MLIP?",
    "answer": "MLIP was developed at Skoltech (Moscow) by Alexander Shapeev, Evgeny Podryabinkin, Konstantin Gubaev, and Ivan Novikov."
