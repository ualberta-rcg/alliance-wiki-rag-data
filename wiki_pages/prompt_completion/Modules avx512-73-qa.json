    "question": "What is miniasm?",
    "answer": "Miniasm is a very fast OLC-based de novo assembler designed for noisy long reads."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of output does miniasm produce?",
    "answer": "Miniasm takes all-vs-all read self-mappings as input and outputs an assembly graph in the GFA format."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a characteristic feature of miniasm regarding consensus steps?",
    "answer": "Miniasm does not include a consensus step; it concatenates pieces of read sequences to generate unitig sequences, resulting in a per-base error rate similar to the raw input reads."
