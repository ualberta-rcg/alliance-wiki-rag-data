    "question": "What is Torch?",
    "answer": "Torch is a scientific computing framework with extensive support for machine learning algorithms, designed to prioritize GPUs, and is efficient due to its LuaJIT scripting language and underlying C/CUDA implementation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the relationship between Torch and PyTorch?",
    "answer": "Torch has a distant relationship to PyTorch; PyTorch provides a Python interface with similar functionality but is not dependent on Torch."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a prerequisite for using Torch?",
    "answer": "Torch depends on CUDA, so you must first load a CUDA module to use it."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the necessary modules to use Torch?",
    "answer": "To use Torch, you must load the CUDA and Torch modules using the command: `module load cuda torch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What package manager is included with Torch for Lua packages?",
    "answer": "Torch comes with the Lua package manager named `luarocks`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view a list of installed Lua packages using luarocks?",
    "answer": "You can see a list of installed Lua packages by running the command `luarocks list`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you install a Lua package locally if it's not on the default list?",
    "answer": "To install a Lua package into your own folder, use the command: `luarocks install --local --deps-mode=all <package name>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command should be used if locally installed Lua packages are not found at runtime?",
    "answer": "If you are having trouble finding locally installed packages at runtime, add the command `eval $(luarocks path --bin)` right before running 'lua your_program.lua'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted for assistance if a Lua package does not install correctly with luarocks?",
    "answer": "If a package does not install well with `luarocks` and you need help, you should contact Technical support."
