    "question": "How can I list all TurboVNC sessions running under my username on a node?",
    "answer": "You can list all vncserver sessions running under your username by executing `vncserver -list`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to terminate a specific VNC server session?",
    "answer": "To terminate a specific VNC server session, use the command `vncserver -kill :DISPLAY#`, replacing `DISPLAY#` with the session's display number (e.g., `:44`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I kill all VNC servers running under my username on a node instantly?",
    "answer": "To kill all VNC servers running under your username on a node instantly, run the command `pkill Xvnc -u $USER`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What option allows multiple connections to a VNC server?",
    "answer": "The `-AlwaysShared` option allows multiple connections to a VNC server."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example command for starting a VNC server that allows multiple connections and has an idle timeout.",
    "answer": "An example command is `vncserver -idletimeout 86400 -alwaysshared`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of using the `-AlwaysShared` option when starting a VNC server for remote work?",
    "answer": "Using the `-AlwaysShared` option allows you to start a VNC server, go to a different location, and then re-connect to the same desktop to seamlessly continue working by establishing new tunnels and using vncviewer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a VNC server is *not* started with the `-AlwaysShared` option, regarding multiple connections?",
    "answer": "If a VNC server is not started with `-AlwaysShared`, only one vncviewer connection is possible. To switch locations, you would need to close all applications, shut down the vncserver, and then restart a new desktop and all applications from scratch."
  },
  {
    "question": "What might cause repeated failures when trying to establish a new VNC connection?",
    "answer": "Repeated failing attempts to establish a new vncserver/vncviewer connection may be due to an old SSH tunnel still running on your desktop and tying up ports."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you identify and terminate old SSH tunnels that might be interfering with VNC connections?",
    "answer": "To identify and kill old SSH tunnels, open a terminal window on your desktop and run `ps ux | grep ssh`, then use `kill PID` with the process ID of the tunnel."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which password should be used if the VNC screensaver times out and requests one?",
    "answer": "If your VNC screensaver times out and requests a password, enter your cluster account password to unlock it, not your vncserver password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used if the MATE desktop screensaver will not unlock?",
    "answer": "If you are running the MATE desktop and the screensaver will not unlock, try running `killall -9 .mate-screensaver`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the VNC screensaver still an issue on the clusters mentioned?",
    "answer": "No, the VNC screensaver has been disabled on the clusters, so it should no longer be a problem."

  {
    "question": "Describe the two-step login process for gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca.",
    "answer": "The login procedure for gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca is a two-step process: first, enter your username and CCDB password, then enter your username and Duo two-factor MFA passcode."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if you enter the wrong password in the first step of the gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca login process?",
    "answer": "If you enter the wrong username/password in the first step for gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca, you will still be prompted by the second step. If you then send your username/passcode, you will receive a 'Success, Logging you in...' message but be returned to the first login screen."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a login loop be resolved when trying to log in to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca?",
    "answer": "To resolve a login loop, ensure you enter your correct username/password combination in the first step of the gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca login process."

    "question": "What is required to run graphics-based programs that utilize hardware-based accelerated OpenGL?",
    "answer": "To run graphics-based programs that utilize hardware-based accelerated OpenGL, the `salloc` command must be modified to request a GPU node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a GPU node is not requested for a graphics program needing OpenGL acceleration?",
    "answer": "If a GPU node is not requested, the program will fall back to using slower software-based rendering on CPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I request the first available GPU node to minimize queue wait time when using `salloc`?",
    "answer": "To request the first available GPU node and minimize queue wait time, you can specify `--gpus-per-node=1` in the `salloc` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example of an `salloc` command to request a GPU node with specific time, CPU, memory, and account.",
    "answer": "An example `salloc` command is `salloc --time=1:00:00 --cpus-per-task=4 --gpus-per-node=1 --mem=16000 --account=def-piname`."
