    "question": "How can I terminate a specific running VNC server?",
    "answer": "You can terminate a specific VNC server using the command `vncserver -kill :DISPLAY#`, replacing `DISPLAY#` with the actual display number."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I find the display number of a VNC server to kill it?",
    "answer": "You can find the display number by running `vncserver -list` in the terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a command to instantly kill all VNC servers running under my username on a node?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can kill all VNC servers instantly by running `pkill Xvnc -u $USER`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I view all VNC servers currently running under my username?",
    "answer": "All VNC servers running under your username (on a login or compute node) can be displayed with the `vncserver -list` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-AlwaysShared` option when starting a VNC server?",
    "answer": "When a VNC server is started with the additional `-AlwaysShared` option, it allows multiple connections to be made to the same desktop from any remote location."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a VNC server is not started with the `-AlwaysShared` option?",
    "answer": "If a VNC server is not started with `-AlwaysShared`, only one vncviewer connection will be possible. To reconnect from a different location, you would need to close all applications, shut down the VNC server, and then restart a new desktop and all applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a common reason for repeated failures to connect to a VNC server?",
    "answer": "Repeated failing attempts to establish a new vncserver/vncviewer connection may be due to an old SSH tunnel still running on your desktop and tying up ports."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I identify and kill old SSH tunnels that might be interfering with VNC connections?",
    "answer": "To identify and kill any such tunnels, open a terminal window on your desktop and run `ps ux | grep ssh` followed by `kill PID` for the relevant process IDs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What password should I use if my VNC screensaver times out and asks for one?",
    "answer": "If your VNC screensaver times out and requests a password, you should enter your cluster account password to unlock it, not your VNC server password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used if the MATE desktop screensaver will not unlock?",
    "answer": "If you are running the MATE desktop and the screensaver will not unlock, try running `killall -9 .mate-screensaver`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are VNC screensavers still an issue on the clusters?",
    "answer": "No, the VNC screensaver has been disabled on the clusters, so it should no longer be a problem."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the two-step login process for gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca.",
    "answer": "The login process for gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca involves two steps: first, entering your username and ccdb password, and second, entering your username and Duo two-factor MFA passcode."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if I enter an incorrect username or password during the first step of logging into gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca?",
    "answer": "If you enter the wrong username/password for the first step, you will still be prompted for the second step. If you then send your username/passcode, you will receive a message saying 'Success, Logging you in...' and be returned to the first login screen."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I reset my alliance ccdb password if I've forgotten it?",
    "answer": "You can visit [https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/security/forgot here] to reset your alliance ccdb password, assuming your account is not pending renewal by your PI."

  {
    "question": "What kind of graphics capabilities do VDI nodes support for software applications?",
    "answer": "VDI nodes support direct vncviewer connections and GPU-accelerated OpenGL graphics for appropriately-configured software applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What software environments are available on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "VDI nodes provide an extra set of software modules in the SnEnv environment, analogous to the StdEnv environments available on all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do VDI nodes differ from regular login nodes in terms of default software environment loading?",
    "answer": "On regular login nodes, a standard software environment and some default modules are automatically loaded, but this is not the case on a VDI node, where no modules are loaded by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "What output would I see if I ran `module list` on a VDI node immediately after logging in?",
    "answer": "You would see 'No modules loaded' because VDI nodes do not automatically load any software modules upon login."
