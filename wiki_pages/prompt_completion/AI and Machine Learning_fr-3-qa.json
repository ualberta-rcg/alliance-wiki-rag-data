    "question": "How can non-deterministic behavior in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with CUDA be avoided?",
    "answer": "To avoid this problem, you can configure the CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG environment variable with a single buffer memory size."

    "question": "What does cuBLAS do if CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG is set to `:16:8`?",
    "answer": "cuBLAS fixes the GPU memory to 8 buffers of 16KB each."
