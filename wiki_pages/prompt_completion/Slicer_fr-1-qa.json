  },
  {
    "question": "When is it recommended to use an interactive node for 3D Slicer?",
    "answer": "If you need to visualize data through the graphical interface, you should use an interactive node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the consequence of parallel rendering on a shared connection node?",
    "answer": "Performing a parallel rendering on a shared connection node will terminate your session."
  },
  {
    "question": "What must be activated for the 3D Slicer graphical user interface to work?",
    "answer": "X11 redirection must be activated."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find instructions for connecting with MobaXTerm?",
    "answer": "For instructions on connecting with MobaXTerm, refer to the 'Connexion \u00e0 un serveur avec MobaXTerm' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should one request an interactive task for 3D Slicer?",
    "answer": "You should request an interactive task to have enough time to explore and visualize your data, and processing will also be faster because you can use more cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request an interactive task for Slicer?",
    "answer": "You can request an interactive task using the command: `salloc --time=1:0:0 --ntasks=2 --x11 --account=def-someuser`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the significance of the `--x11` argument in the `salloc` command for Slicer?",
    "answer": "The `--x11` argument ensures X11 forwarding is enabled, which is necessary for graphical display."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the Slicer module on an interactive node?",
    "answer": "Load the Slicer module using the command `module load slicer`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start 3D Slicer on an interactive node after loading the module?",
    "answer": "Start 3D Slicer using the command `Slicer`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done after quitting Slicer when using an interactive task?",
    "answer": "After quitting Slicer, remember to terminate the interactive task."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances should the command-line interface and non-interactive tasks be used for 3D Slicer?",
    "answer": "The command-line interface and non-interactive tasks should be used if you need to execute the same task with multiple images, or if you do not need to see the processed images as they are created."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there external resources for Slicer batch processing or command-line scripting?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can consult `https://discourse.slicer.org/t/rtstruct-to-label-map/2437` and `https://discourse.slicer.org/t/slicer-batch-processing-question-no-main-window-python-script/1863`."
