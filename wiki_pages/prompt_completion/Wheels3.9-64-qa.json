Let me re-check 'referencing' from the chunk: `0.36.2, 0.36.1, 0.35.1, 0.34.0, 0.33.0, 0.31.1, 0.31.0, 0.30.2, 0.30.0`. So the previous answer was wrong. The question is still valid, I just need to check other packages for those versions or state that none of the mentioned packages have exactly those versions."
