    "question": "How is the order in which jobs are considered for scheduling determined?",
    "answer": "The order in which jobs are considered for scheduling is determined by 'priority', which is calculated using the Fair Tree algorithm."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Resource Allocation Project (RAP) and how is it specified for a job?",
    "answer": "Each job is charged to a Resource Allocation Project (RAP), and you specify the project using the `--account` argument when submitting the job with `sbatch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical account code prefixes for projects granted CPU or GPU time from a Resource Allocation Competition?",
    "answer": "Account codes for projects from a Resource Allocation Competition will probably begin with `rrg-` or `rpp-`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical account code prefix for non-RAC projects, also known as Rapid Access Service projects?",
    "answer": "Non-RAC projects, or Rapid Access Service projects, typically have account codes that begin with `def-`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are target usage levels set for RAC projects versus non-RAC projects?",
    "answer": "RAC projects have target levels determined by the number of CPU-years or GPU-years granted, while non-RAC projects (i.e., `def-` accounts) all have equal target levels, adjusted periodically based on the number of active projects."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to examine a research group's usage and share information?",
    "answer": "The `sshare` command can be used to examine a group's usage and share information."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it necessary to append `_cpu` or `_gpu` to the account code when using the `sshare` command?",
    "answer": "You must append `_cpu` or `_gpu` to the end of the account code, as appropriate, because CPU and GPU use are tracked separately."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the `sshare` output, which line is most important for scheduling and what does it describe?",
    "answer": "The first line of the `sshare` output, highlighted in red, is most important for scheduling and describes the status of the project relative to all other projects using the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the example, what does a project's LevelFS of 37.357207 indicate about its job priority?",
    "answer": "A LevelFS of 37.357207 indicates that the group has used a small fraction of their allocated share of resources, leading to an expectation that jobs submitted by this group will have a fairly high priority."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does user status within a project affect job priority compared to other users in the same project?",
    "answer": "Successive lines in the `sshare` output describe the status of each user relative to other users within the project. Users with a higher LevelFS within the group are expected to have slightly more priority."
  },
  {
    "question": "What determines the priority of jobs belonging to one research group as compared to other research groups?",
    "answer": "The priority of jobs belonging to a group as compared to other research groups is determined solely by the group\u2019s fairshare (LevelFS) and not by the users' fairshare within the group."
