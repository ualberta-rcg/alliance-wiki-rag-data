  {
    "question": "What is the underlying technology for SSH security?",
    "answer": "SSH relies on public key cryptography (PK) for its security."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two parts of a key pair in public key cryptography?",
    "answer": "A key pair consists of a private part, which must be kept secret, and a public part, which can be distributed freely."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does public key cryptography handle message encoding and decoding?",
    "answer": "Anyone can use the public key to encode a message, but only the private part can decode it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is public key cryptography sometimes referred to as asymmetric encryption?",
    "answer": "It is described as asymmetric encryption because the public key encodes a message, and only the private key can decode it."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can public key cryptography be used to verify identities?",
    "answer": "A second party (Bob) can send a message encoded with a user's (Alice's) public key; if the user can decode it, they possess Alice's private key, thus establishing identity."
  },
  {
    "question": "What other internet protocols use public key systems?",
    "answer": "PK systems are the basis for SSL and TLS protocols, which protect most internet traffic like HTTPS websites."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what ways is Public Key (PK) used on our systems with SSH?",
    "answer": "PK is used in SSH to ensure connection to an authentic server using the system's public key, to establish an encrypted session for secure traffic, and for the remote server to verify your identity to allow login."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is strongly recommended for connecting to our systems?",
    "answer": "Using Public Key (PK) is strongly recommended to connect to our systems, as it is almost always more secure than using a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are required to use Public Key (PK) for SSH?",
    "answer": "To use PK, you must generate a key pair and install the public key on the systems you intend to connect with."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should an SSH key pair be generated?",
    "answer": "You should generate a key pair on your own system, or on a system you believe is secure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a critical rule regarding the private part of an SSH key pair?",
    "answer": "The private part of the key pair should never be shared or copied on another computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a passphrase in the context of generating an SSH key pair?",
    "answer": "A passphrase is a string used to encrypt the private key when generating a key pair."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of passphrase is recommended for an SSH key?",
    "answer": "A strong and memorable passphrase, preferably 15 characters or more, is recommended."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of a passphrase for an SSH private key?",
    "answer": "The passphrase offers protection if the private key file is stolen."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find instructions for generating SSH keys using Windows clients like PuTTY or MobaXterm?",
    "answer": "For Windows PuTTY or MobaXterm clients, see the 'Generating SSH keys in Windows' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find instructions for generating SSH keys in Unix-like environments?",
    "answer": "For Unix-like environments (Linux, Mac, Windows Subsystem for Linux or Cygwin), see the 'Using SSH keys in Linux' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users install their SSH key on target systems?",
    "answer": "To install the key, you must make the target/destination system aware of the public part of your key."
  },
  {
    "question": "When was a convenient method for installing SSH keys added?",
    "answer": "A convenient way to install SSH keys was added in March 2021."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to install your SSH public key using the CCDB method?",
    "answer": "Go to CCDB at https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/ssh_authorized_keys or via the CCDB menu."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you grab your SSH public key on Linux/macOS?",
    "answer": "On Linux/MacOS, enter `cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub` on the command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you grab your SSH public key on Windows?",
    "answer": "On Windows, you can examine your public key by opening the file with Notepad."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the example public key provided in the document be used by users?",
    "answer": "No, you must generate your own pair of public and private keys; you cannot copy the example for your own use."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if an SSH public key is in a different format, such as one generated by PuTTY?",
    "answer": "Open PuTTY Key Generator or MobaXterm SSH Key Generator, load the private key, and grab the content under 'Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the third step for installing your SSH key using the CCDB method?",
    "answer": "Paste the public portion of your key into the CCDB form and provide a description for the key."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can OpenStack cloud systems access SSH keys uploaded to CCDB?",
    "answer": "No, OpenStack cloud systems cannot access the keys entered in the CCDB."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does it typically take for public key changes to propagate to clusters after being loaded into CCDB?",
    "answer": "Changes to public keys will often propagate to clusters in a few minutes, but in some cases, it can take up to approximately 30 minutes."
