  {
    "question": "What does SSH rely on for its security?",
    "answer": "SSH relies on public key cryptography (PK) for its security."
  },
  {
    "question": "What two parts make up a key pair in public key cryptography?",
    "answer": "A key pair consists of a private part, which is kept secret, and a public part, which can be distributed freely."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is public key cryptography referred to as asymmetric encryption?",
    "answer": "Public key cryptography is described as asymmetric encryption because anyone can use the public key to encode a message, but only the private part can decode it."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can public key cryptography be used to verify identities?",
    "answer": "PK can be used to verify identities by having a second party send a message encoded with a user's public key; if the user can decode the message, it proves access to the private key and establishes identity."
  },
  {
    "question": "What common internet protocols are based on public key systems?",
    "answer": "PK systems are the basis for the SSL and TLS protocols that protect most internet traffic, such as HTTPS websites."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the primary uses of Public Key (PK) in SSH on our systems?",
    "answer": "On our systems, PK is used in SSH to ensure connection to the authentic server, establish an encrypted session for secure traffic, and allow the remote server to verify your identity for login."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to use Public Key (PK) or passwords for connecting to our systems?",
    "answer": "It is strongly recommended to use Public Key (PK) to connect to our systems, as it is almost always more secure than using a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the initial configuration required to use Public Key (PK) for SSH?",
    "answer": "To use PK, you must generate a key pair and install the public key on the systems you intend to connect with."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should a key pair be generated?",
    "answer": "You should generate a key pair on your own system, or on a system you believe is secure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should the private part of a key pair ever be shared or copied to another computer?",
    "answer": "No, the private part of the key pair should never be shared or copied on another computer, as is the case with any password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a passphrase used for when generating an SSH key pair?",
    "answer": "A passphrase is a string used to encrypt the private key, offering protection if the private key file is stolen."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended length for a strong passphrase?",
    "answer": "A strong passphrase of 15 characters or more is recommended."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find instructions for generating SSH keys in Windows for PuTTY or MobaXterm clients?",
    "answer": "For Windows PuTTY or MobaXterm clients, users should see the 'Generating SSH keys in Windows' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find instructions for generating SSH keys in a Unix-like environment?",
    "answer": "For a Unix-like environment (Linux, Mac, Windows Subsystem for Linux or Cygwin), users should see the 'Using SSH keys in Linux' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you install an SSH key using the CCDB method?",
    "answer": "To install the key using CCDB, you must go to `https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/ssh_authorized_keys`, grab your SSH public key, and then upload it into the CCDB form along with a description."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you access the CCDB interface to install SSH authorized keys?",
    "answer": "You can access the CCDB interface by going to `https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/ssh_authorized_keys` or via the CCDB menu."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you obtain your SSH public key on Windows for installation via CCDB?",
    "answer": "On Windows, you can obtain your SSH public key by opening the file with Notepad, as the public key is plain text."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you obtain your SSH public key on Linux/MacOS for installation via CCDB?",
    "answer": "On Linux/MacOS, you can obtain your SSH public key by entering `cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub` on the command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if an SSH public key is in PEM format and needs to be installed via CCDB?",
    "answer": "If the public key is in PEM format (e.g., from PuTTY), you should open PuTTY Key Generator or MobaxTerm SSH Key Generator, load the private key, and then grab the content under 'Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys' for conversion before uploading."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is required when uploading an SSH public key to the CCDB form?",
    "answer": "When uploading an SSH public key into the CCDB form, you need to paste the public portion of your key and provide a description for it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do SSH keys loaded into CCDB work for OpenStack cloud systems?",
    "answer": "No, OpenStack cloud systems cannot access the keys entered in the CCDB."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does it take for SSH public key changes made in CCDB to propagate to clusters?",
    "answer": "Changes to public keys will often propagate to clusters in a few minutes; however, in some cases, it can take up to approximately 30 minutes."
