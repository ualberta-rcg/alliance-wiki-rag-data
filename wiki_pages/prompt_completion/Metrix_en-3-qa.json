    "question": "What information is displayed at the top of a GPU task page?",
    "answer": "At the top of the page, you will find the task name, its number, your username, and its status."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I view the submission script details for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The details of your submission script are displayed by clicking on 'Voir le script de la t\u00e2che'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the submission script always available for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "No, if the task was launched in interactive mode, the submission script will not be available."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I access the working directory and submission command for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The working directory and submission command are accessible by clicking on 'Voir la commande de soumission'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is found in the section following the submission command on a GPU task page?",
    "answer": "The next section is reserved for scheduler information."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I navigate to my GPU account page from a GPU task page?",
    "answer": "You can access your GPU account page by clicking on your account number in the scheduler information section."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can I do in the 'Ressources' section of a GPU task page?",
    "answer": "In the 'Ressources' section, you can get an initial overview of your task's resource usage by comparing the 'Allou\u00e9s' (Allocated) and 'Utilis\u00e9s' (Used) columns for the different listed parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the CPU graph show on a GPU task page?",
    "answer": "The CPU graph allows you to visualize the usage of the requested CPU cores over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I customize the display of the CPU graph?",
    "answer": "Yes, on the right side of the CPU graph, you can select or deselect different cores according to your needs."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the CPU graph not available for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The CPU graph is not available for very short tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information does the 'M\u00e9moire' (Memory) graph provide for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'M\u00e9moire' graph allows you to visualize the usage over time of the memory you have requested for the CPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can be observed using the 'Process and threads' graph on a GPU task page?",
    "answer": "The 'Process and threads' graph allows you to observe various parameters related to processes and execution threads."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do the filesystem usage graphs for a GPU task show the usage of the entire node?",
    "answer": "No, the filesystem usage graphs represent the usage for the current task, not the entire node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is displayed on the left side of the filesystem usage graphs for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "On the left, a representation of the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) is displayed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the right side of the filesystem usage graphs for a GPU task illustrate?",
    "answer": "On the right, the graph illustrates the data transfer rate between the task and the filesystem over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the data transfer rate graph for filesystem usage in a GPU task?",
    "answer": "This graph allows you to identify periods of intense activity or low utilization of the filesystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the GPU graph represent?",
    "answer": "The GPU graph represents your usage of the GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' indicate in the GPU graph?",
    "answer": "The 'Streaming Multiprocessors' (SM) active parameter indicates the percentage of time during which the GPU executes a warp (a group of consecutive threads) in the last sampling window."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal value for 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active'?",
    "answer": "Ideally, the value for 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' should be around 80%."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'SM occupancy' and what is its generally expected value?",
    "answer": "'SM occupancy' is defined as the ratio between the number of warps assigned to an SM and the maximum number of warps an SM can manage, and a value around 50% is generally expected."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal value for the 'Tensor' parameter in the GPU graph?",
    "answer": "Regarding the 'Tensor' parameter, its value should be as high as possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is a high 'Tensor' parameter value desirable?",
    "answer": "A high 'Tensor' parameter value is desirable because, ideally, your code should exploit this part of the GPU, which is optimized for multidimensional matrix multiplications and convolutions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be observed for Floating Point operations (FP64, FP32, FP16) in the GPU graph?",
    "answer": "For Floating Point operations (FP64, FP32, and FP16), you should observe significant activity on only one of these types, depending on the precision used by your code."
