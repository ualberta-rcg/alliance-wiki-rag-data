    "question": "Where can I find scheduler information for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The scheduler information is in the dedicated section, and you can access your GPU account page by clicking on your account number."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I get an initial overview of my GPU task's resource usage?",
    "answer": "In the 'Ressources' section, you can compare the 'Allou\u00e9s' (Allocated) and 'Utilis\u00e9s' (Used) columns for the listed parameters to get an initial overview of your task's resource usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information does the CPU graph provide for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'CPU' graph allows you to visualize the usage of the requested CPU cores over time. You can select/deselect different cores as needed, but this graph is not available for very short tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the Memory graph show for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'M\u00e9moire' (Memory) graph allows you to visualize the usage over time of the memory you requested for the CPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "What parameters can be observed using the 'Process and threads' graph?",
    "answer": "The 'Process and threads' graph allows you to observe different parameters related to processes and execution threads."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is file system usage represented for a GPU task in the graphs?",
    "answer": "For the current task, file system usage is represented by IOPS (input/output operations per second) on the left graph and data transfer rate (bandwidth) between the task and the file system over time on the right graph. This helps identify periods of intense or low file system activity."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the file system usage graph show data for the entire node or just the current task?",
    "answer": "The file system usage graphs represent the usage for the current task only, not the entire node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' value in the GPU graph?",
    "answer": "The 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' parameter, indicating the percentage of time the GPU executes a warp, should ideally be around 80%."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the expected 'SM occupancy' value in the GPU graph?",
    "answer": "The 'SM occupancy' parameter, defined as the ratio between assigned warps and the maximum warps an SM can handle, is generally expected to be around 50%."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the 'Tensor' parameter behave in the GPU graph?",
    "answer": "The 'Tensor' parameter value should be as high as possible, as it indicates the code is exploiting the GPU's part optimized for multidimensional matrix multiplications and convolutions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be observed for Floating Point operations (FP64, FP32, FP16) in the GPU graph?",
    "answer": "For Floating Point operations (FP64, FP32, FP16), significant activity should be observed on only one of these types, depending on the precision used by your code."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is GPU memory usage displayed?",
    "answer": "On the left, there is a graph indicating the memory used by the GPU. On the right, a graph displays the GPU's memory access cycles, showing the percentage of cycles during which the device's memory interface is active for data transfer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information does the GPU power graph provide?",
    "answer": "The GPU power graph displays the evolution of the GPU's energy consumption (in watts) over time."
