    "question": "What is the ABINIT program used for?",
    "answer": "ABINIT is a software suite designed to calculate the optical, mechanical, vibrational, and other observable properties of materials, using density functional theory and related perturbation theories and many-body Green's functions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check which versions of ABINIT are currently available?",
    "answer": "You can check available ABINIT versions by running the command `module spider abinit`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I find out if a specific ABINIT version has module dependencies?",
    "answer": "To see if there are other modules that must be loaded first for a specific ABINIT version, run `module spider abinit/<version_number>`, for example, `module spider abinit/8.4.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users obtain atomic data files for ABINIT?",
    "answer": "Users should obtain the atomic data files for their calculations by following the links from the ABINIT Atomic data files page at `https://www.abinit.org/downloads/atomic-data-files`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical size of ABINIT atomic data files?",
    "answer": "These files rarely exceed 1 megabyte in size."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I download ABINIT atomic data files to a login node?",
    "answer": "Atomic data files can be downloaded directly to any login node using `wget` and the URL of the data file. For example: `wget http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/pseudos/nc-sr-04_pbe_standard/H.psp8.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are the data files for ABINIT tutorials and tests located?",
    "answer": "Data files for ABINIT tutorials and tests can be found at `$EBROOTABINIT/share/abinit-test/Psps_for_tests/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find input files mentioned in the ABINIT tutorial?",
    "answer": "Input files mentioned in the ABINIT tutorial are located at `$EBROOTABINIT/share/abinit-test/tutorial`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should ABINIT calculations be executed, apart from trivial examples?",
    "answer": "ABINIT calculations, other than the most trivial tests or tutorial examples, should be run via the Slurm job scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to execute ABINIT within the example job script?",
    "answer": "The command `srun abinit < parameters.txt >& output.log` is used to run ABINIT within the example job script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Slurm resources are requested in the provided example job script for ABINIT?",
    "answer": "The example job script requests an account (`def-someuser`), 2 nodes, 64 MPI processes, 1024 MB of memory per CPU, and a time limit of 2 days (`2-00:00`)."
