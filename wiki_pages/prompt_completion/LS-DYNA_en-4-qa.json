    "question": "What does `ls-dyna_s` signify in the context of MPP solvers?",
    "answer": "`ls-dyna_s` refers to the single precision MPP solver."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `ls-dyna_d` signify in the context of MPP solvers?",
    "answer": "`ls-dyna_d` refers to the double precision MPP solver."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can jobs be submitted to an arbitrary number of compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Jobs can be submitted to an arbitrary number of compute nodes by specifying the number of cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the advantage of specifying the core count when submitting jobs?",
    "answer": "Specifying the core count allows the scheduler to determine the optimal number of compute nodes to minimize job wait time in the queue."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a crucial consideration for memory when submitting MPP jobs by specifying core count?",
    "answer": "A sufficiently large value of `mem-per-cpu` must be specified so the master processor can successfully decompose and handle its computations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Slurm option specifies the total number of cores in a `script-mpp-bycore.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The `--ntasks` option is used to specify the total number of cores, for example, `#SBATCH --ntasks=64`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is memory per core specified in a Slurm script for MPP jobs submitted by core count?",
    "answer": "Memory per core is specified using the `--mem-per-cpu` option, for example, `#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2G`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which LS-DYNA MPI module version is loaded in the `script-mpp-bycore.sh` example?",
    "answer": "The `ls-dyna-mpi/12.2.1` module is loaded in the example script, after loading `StdEnv/2023` and `intel/2023.2.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to run LS-DYNA in double precision MPP mode with `airbag.deploy.k` as input and 200M memory?",
    "answer": "The command is `srun ls-dyna_d i=airbag.deploy.k memory=200M`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should standard scaling tests be performed before running a full LS-DYNA simulation?",
    "answer": "Standard scaling tests should be run to determine the optimal number of cores that can be used before simulation slowdown occurs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one determine the Job Wall-clock time, CPU Efficiency, and Memory Efficiency of completed LS-DYNA test jobs?",
    "answer": "The `seff jobnumber` command can be used to determine these metrics for successfully completed test jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What did recent LS-DYNA performance testing on different clusters reveal about airbag jobs?",
    "answer": "Recent testing with airbag jobs found significantly better performance on Cedar and Narval than on Graham."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended steps before running full LS-DYNA simulations, regarding performance?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to A) conduct standard scaling tests on a given cluster and B) run identical test cases on each cluster before settling on an optimal job size, module version, and cluster configuration."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is LS-PrePost used for?",
    "answer": "LS-PrePost is used for pre- and post-processing of LS-DYNA models."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does LS-PrePost require a license?",
    "answer": "No, LS-PrePost does not require a license."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which nodes can LS-PrePost be used?",
    "answer": "LS-PrePost can be used on any cluster node or on the Graham VDI nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch LS-PrePost version 4.8 on cluster nodes?",
    "answer": "First, connect to a compute or login node with TigerVNC. Then, load the `StdEnv/2020` and `ls-prepost/4.8` modules, and run `lsprepost`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to launch LS-PrePost version 4.9 on cluster nodes?",
    "answer": "After loading `StdEnv/2020` and `ls-prepost/4.9` modules, you can run either `lsprepost` or `lspp49`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules must be loaded to use LS-PrePost version 4.8 on Graham VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You must load `CcEnv StdEnv/2020` and `ls-prepost/4.8` modules to use LS-PrePost version 4.8 on Graham VDI nodes."
