  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the /nearline file system?",
    "answer": "The /nearline file system utilizes tape storage to preserve inactive data, such as datasets that are not required for use for several months."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for handling files smaller than ~10GB that need to be stored on /nearline?",
    "answer": "Files smaller than approximately 10GB should be grouped into archive files (tarballs) using `tar` or a similar archiving tool."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should very large files, specifically those over 4TB, be prepared for storage on /nearline?",
    "answer": "Files exceeding 4TB should be divided into 1TB parts using a tool like the `split` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it permissible to copy small files directly to /nearline?",
    "answer": "No, small files should not be copied to /nearline, with the sole exception of index files."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to compress my data before copying it to /nearline?",
    "answer": "It is not necessary to compress data on /nearline because the tape archiving system automatically performs compression using specialized circuits. However, already compressed data can be copied without any issues."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which tools are recommended for creating archive files for storage on /nearline?",
    "answer": "You should use either `tar` or `dar` to create archive files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the best practice regarding the location of source files when creating an archive for /nearline?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to keep the source files in their original file system and not copy them to /nearline before creating the archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most efficient method for creating an archive that will be stored on /nearline?",
    "answer": "The most efficient method is to create the archive directly on /nearline, as this avoids the need for additional storage space and is more efficient than creating it elsewhere and then copying it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `tar` options can be used for managing archives of several hundreds of GB?",
    "answer": "For archives of several hundreds of GB, the `tar` options `-M (--multi-volume)` and `-L (--tape-length)` can be used to produce files of a suitable size."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which `dar` option is useful for handling large archives?",
    "answer": "With `dar`, the `-s (--slice)` option can be used to manage large archives."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it advisable to create an index when files are grouped into an archive?",
    "answer": "Creating an index is advisable because it becomes difficult to locate a particular file within a grouped archive, avoiding the need to retrieve an entire large collection just for a few files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an index be created for a `tar` archive that has just been created?",
    "answer": "For an archive that has just been created, an index can be generated using the command `tar tvvf /nearline/def-sponsor/user/mycollection.tar > /nearline/def-sponsor/user/mycollection.index`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are index files allowed to be stored on /nearline?",
    "answer": "Yes, even if they are small files, index files can be stored on /nearline."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can compute nodes access data stored on /nearline?",
    "answer": "No, compute nodes cannot access data stored on /nearline because /nearline is not mounted on them, and data retrieval can take a significant amount of time, which is not suitable for computational tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it recommended to use a copy node (DTN) for archiving operations?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to use a copy node (DTN) because creating archive files is resource-intensive. If you can connect to the cluster via a DTN, it is preferable over a login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be used for archiving if a copy node (DTN) is unavailable?",
    "answer": "If a copy node (DTN) is not available, you should use a login node for archiving."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of using a terminal multiplexer like `tmux` for archiving large file collections?",
    "answer": "A terminal multiplexer like `tmux` should be used for archiving large file collections because the process can take many hours or even days, and it prevents SSH session interruptions, allowing the program to continue running in the background."
