  {
    "question": "What happens to storage equipment that is removed due to failure?",
    "answer": "Any storage equipment that must be removed due to failure is either destroyed, encrypted, or erased before being returned to the supplier for replacement."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is software access to filesystems on the clusters protected?",
    "answer": "Software access to our cluster filesystems is protected by standard POSIX and ACL permissions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What attributes are associated with each file?",
    "answer": "Each file is associated with an owner and a group."
  },
  {
    "question": "What entities can a file's group represent?",
    "answer": "The group associated with a file is either a user or a research project."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default permissions for newly created files?",
    "answer": "The default permissions are such that new files created are writable by the owner and readable by the group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Whose responsibility is it to ensure correct file group and access permissions?",
    "answer": "The file owner must ensure that the file belongs to the correct group and that the appropriate access permissions are defined."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the technical team counter elevation of privilege attacks?",
    "answer": "To counter this, our technical team monitors CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) mailing lists and applies the required patches."
  },
  {
    "question": "What additional measures are taken to detect and prevent intrusion?",
    "answer": "We also examine abnormal behaviors that might indicate an intrusion, in addition to imposing stricter security measures for our staff accounts that have privileged access compared to regular users."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there always a possibility of unauthorized access, even with precautions?",
