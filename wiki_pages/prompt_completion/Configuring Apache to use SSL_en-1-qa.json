  },
  {
    "question": "Should self-signed certificates be used for public-facing sites?",
    "answer": "If you have a public-facing site, you probably do not want to use a self-signed certificate."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tool is recommended for checking security settings after configuring a web server with a certificate?",
    "answer": "It is a good idea to check the security settings using ssllabs' ssltest tool, which can suggest changes to improve security."

    "question": "What is Certbot and what does it do?",
    "answer": "Certbot is a tool that automatically creates or renews an SSL certificate signed by the Let's Encrypt CA and automatically configures your web server to use the SSL certificate."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific port must be opened if configuring Certbot via Apache?",
    "answer": "If you are configuring Certbot via Apache, you must open port 443 (TCP ingress) for Certbot to connect to the site."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what types of sites are self-signed certificates explicitly stated as not suitable?",
    "answer": "Self-signed certificates should not be used for production sites."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which operating system are the self-signed certificate procedure steps in this document based on?",
    "answer": "The steps for creating a self-signed SSL certificate assume you are using the Ubuntu operating system."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you activate the SSL module in Apache on Ubuntu?",
    "answer": "Once Apache has been installed, the SSL module must be enabled with `sudo a2enmod ssl` followed by `sudo service apache2 restart`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to create a self-signed SSL certificate?",
    "answer": "The command to create a self-signed SSL certificate is `sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/server.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does being asked for a pass phrase indicate when creating a self-signed SSL certificate with the provided command?",
    "answer": "If you are asked for a pass phrase, it likely means that you missed the `-nodes` option in the `openssl` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which question is considered the most important to answer when creating a self-signed SSL certificate?",
    "answer": "The most important question to answer when creating a self-signed SSL certificate is the 'Common Name' question."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should the 'Common Name' be when creating a self-signed certificate for your server?",
    "answer": "The 'Common Name' should be the domain name of your server."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the 'Common Name' be formatted for a virtual machine on 'our clouds'?",
    "answer": "For a virtual machine on 'our clouds', the 'Common Name' should look similar to `XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX.cloud.computecanada.ca`, with the Xs replaced by the floating IP associated with the virtual machine."
