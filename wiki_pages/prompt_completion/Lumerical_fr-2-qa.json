  },
  {
    "question": "How can one efficiently execute multiple FDTD Solutions simulations?",
    "answer": "To efficiently execute multiple simulations, you can use script templates by creating `$HOME/bin` for `fdtd-run.sh` and `$HOME/bin/templates` for `fdtd-mpi-template.sh` and `fdtd-process-template.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of `fdtd-mpi-template.sh` and `fdtd-process-template.sh`?",
    "answer": "`fdtd-mpi-template.sh` is a shell interpreter for `fdtd_solutions.sh`, while `fdtd-process-template.sh` defines the necessary computing resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you submit an FDTD Solutions task for a single node using the template scripts?",
    "answer": "Use the command `fdtd-run.sh fsp1 [fsp2 ...]` to submit tasks for a single node, which will utilize 32 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you submit an FDTD Solutions task for multiple nodes using the template scripts?",
    "answer": "To submit tasks for multiple nodes, use the command `fdtd-run.sh -nn <nodes> fsp1 [fsp2 ...]`, specifying the desired number of nodes with `<nodes>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default number of nodes used if not specified with `fdtd-run.sh`?",
    "answer": "If the `-nn` argument is not provided, the `fdtd-run.sh` script defaults to using 1 node."
