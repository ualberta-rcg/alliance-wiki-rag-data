  {
    "question": "Why might a newly created VM on a private network not be directly accessible?",
    "answer": "A VM on a private network is not directly accessible from outside the tenant because it has not been assigned a floating IP."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a jump host or bastion host used for in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "A jump host (or bastion host) can be used to access VMs on a private network that do not have a floating IP, as they are both on the same private network. This strategy helps conserve floating IPs, which are a limited resource."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are Floating IPs handled in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "Floating IPs are not created directly on a VM. Instead, they are first allocated to the project from a pool and then associated with the VM's private network interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Terraform resource is used to declare and allocate a floating IP in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "The `openstack_networking_floatingip_v2` resource is used to declare and allocate a floating IP. You need to specify the `pool` from which to allocate it, such as `ext_net`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you allocate a floating IP using Terraform?",
    "answer": "To allocate a floating IP, you define an `openstack_networking_floatingip_v2` resource in your Terraform configuration, specifying the `pool` (e.g., `pool = \"ext_net\"`), and then run `terraform apply`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Terraform resource is used to associate an allocated floating IP with a VM?",
    "answer": "The `openstack_compute_floatingip_associate_v2` resource is used to associate an allocated floating IP with a VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you associate a floating IP with a VM using Terraform?",
    "answer": "To associate a floating IP with a VM, you define an `openstack_compute_floatingip_associate_v2` resource, setting `floating_ip` to the address attribute of the allocated floating IP resource (e.g., `openstack_networking_floatingip_v2.myvm_fip.address`) and `instance_id` to the ID of the VM instance (e.g., `openstack_compute_instance_v2.myvm.id`), then run `terraform apply`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical syntax for referencing attributes of other resources in Terraform?",
    "answer": "References to other resources and their attributes typically follow the syntax: `<resource type>.<resource name>.<attribute>`."
