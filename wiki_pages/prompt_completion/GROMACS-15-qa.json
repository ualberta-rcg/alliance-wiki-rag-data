    "question": "What is GROMACS-RAMD?",
    "answer": "GROMACS-RAMD is a fork of GROMACS that implements the Random Acceleration Molecular Dynamics (RAMD) method."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the RAMD method?",
    "answer": "The RAMD method is used to identify ligand exit routes from buried binding pockets of receptors and investigate the mechanism of ligand dissociation by applying an additional randomly oriented force to a molecule in the system."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find options specific to RAMD in GROMACS-RAMD?",
    "answer": "RAMD-specific MDP options can be found on the GROMACS-RAMD GitHub page."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is GROMACS-SWAXS?",
    "answer": "GROMACS-SWAXS is a modified version of GROMACS for computing small- and wide-angle X-ray or neutron scattering curves (SAXS/SANS) and for doing SAXS/SANS-driven molecular dynamics simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find documentation and tutorials for GROMACS-SWAXS?",
    "answer": "You can refer to the GROMACS-SWAXS Documentation for a description of features and tutorials."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules enable running GROMACS-SWAXS v2021.7 on GPUs under StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "The modules are `StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 openmpi/4.1.5 cuda/12.2 gromacs-swaxs/2021.7-0.5.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is G_MMPBSA used for?",
    "answer": "G_MMPBSA is a tool that calculates components of binding energy using the MM-PBSA method, excluding the entropic term, and the energetic contribution of each residue to binding using an energy decomposition scheme."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the compatibility of G_MMPBSA with GROMACS versions?",
    "answer": "G_MMPBSA is only compatible with GROMACS 5.1.x, as its development stalled in April 2016."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I load the installed version of G_MMPBSA?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of GROMACS and APBS were used to compile the installed G_MMPBSA?",
    "answer": "The installed G_MMPBSA was compiled with `gromacs/5.1.5` and `apbs/1.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any known issues with G_MMPBSA regarding accuracy?",
    "answer": "Yes, G_MMPBSA uses implicit solvents, and studies conclude there are issues with the accuracy of these methods for calculating binding free energies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tool is recommended as an alternative to G_MMPBSA for newer GROMACS versions?",
    "answer": "For newer versions of GROMACS, gmx_MMPBSA is recommended instead of G_MMPBSA."
