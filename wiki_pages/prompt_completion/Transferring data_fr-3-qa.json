    "question": "How do you display the overall transfer progress when using rsync for many small files?",
    "answer": "For transferring multiple small files, it is preferable to display the overall transfer progress using the `rsync -azh --no-g --no-p --info=progress2` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the rsync command to transfer files from a remote system to a local /project directory?",
    "answer": "To transfer files from a remote system to a local /project directory, use a command like `rsync -avzh --no-g --no-p someuser@nibi.alliancecan.ca:REMOTENAME ~/projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you perform a local rsync transfer from /home or /scratch to a /project directory on the same system?",
    "answer": "For a local transfer from /home or /scratch to /project on the same system, do not indicate the cluster name and use a command like `rsync -avh --no-g --no-p LOCALNAME ~/projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you copy a local directory from /home to /project while preserving mode and timestamps using the `cp` command?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `cp -rv --preserve=\"mode,timestamps\" LOCALNAME ~/projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/` to copy a local directory from /home to /project while preserving mode and timestamps."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key difference between `cp` and `rsync` when copying a local directory to a new destination name?",
    "answer": "Unlike `rsync`, if `LOCALNAME` is a directory and you use `cp` to copy it to `somedir`, it will be renamed `somedir` if `somedir` does not already exist."
  },
  {
    "question": "What alternative method can be used to compare two systems for synchronization if Globus is not an option and rsync is too slow?",
    "answer": "If Globus is not an option and rsync is too slow for synchronization, the two systems can be compared using a checksum utility."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you generate a log file of SHA1 checksums for all files in a specified directory?",
    "answer": "You can generate a log file of SHA1 checksums for all files in a directory using the command: `find /home/username/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sha1sum | tee checksum-result.log`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `checksum-result.log` file generated by the example command?",
    "answer": "The `checksum-result.log` file created in the current directory contains all the checksums of the files located in `/home/username/`, with the sums displayed as the process unfolds."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can large rsync transfers be made to run in the background to avoid interruption from SSH connection breaks?",
    "answer": "For large transfers or numerous files, rsync can be run in the background using tools like GNU Screen or tmux to operate despite SSH connection breaks."
  },
  {
    "question": "After a checksum operation, which utility can identify files that do not match?",
    "answer": "After a checksum operation is complete, the `diff` utility can find the files that do not match, for example, `diff checksum-result-silo.log checksum-dtn.log`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you prevent false differences when using `diff` on checksum files that might have been generated in a different order by `find`?",
    "answer": "To prevent false differences when `find` generates checksum files in a different order, sort both files using `sort -k2` before running `diff` on them."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does SFTP stand for and what protocol does it utilize for data transfer?",
    "answer": "SFTP stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol and it uses the SSH protocol, which encrypts the transferred data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you initiate an SFTP connection to a remote address?",
    "answer": "You initiate an SFTP connection by running `sftp USERNAME@ADDRESS` from your local terminal."
