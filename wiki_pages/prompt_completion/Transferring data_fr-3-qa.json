    "question": "How do you display the overall transfer progress for multiple small files when using rsync?",
    "answer": "For transferring multiple small files, it is preferable to display the overall transfer progress using the `--info=progress2` option, for example: `rsync -azh --no-g --no-p --info=progress2 LOCALNAME someuser@graham.alliancecan.ca:projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I transfer files from a remote system to a local /project directory using rsync?",
    "answer": "You can transfer files from a remote system to a local /project directory using a command like `rsync -avzh --no-g --no-p someuser@graham.alliancecan.ca:REMOTENAME ~/projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`, where REMOTENAME is the path to the remote file or directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the rsync command to transfer a local file or directory from /home or /scratch to /project on the same system?",
    "answer": "To transfer a local file or directory (from /home or /scratch) to /project on the same system, use `rsync -avh --no-g --no-p LOCALNAME ~/projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does `cp` behave differently from `rsync` when transferring a local directory to a destination that does not yet exist?",
    "answer": "Unlike rsync, if LOCALNAME (source directory) is a directory and somedir (destination) does not exist yet, `cp` will rename LOCALNAME to somedir."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should checksum comparison be used for data synchronization?",
    "answer": "Checksum comparison should be used if Globus cannot be used to synchronize two systems and rsync is too slow."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which utility is used in the example to compare checksums of files?",
    "answer": "The example uses `sha1sum` to compare checksums of files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I generate SHA1 checksums for all files in a directory and save them to a log file?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `find /home/username/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sha1sum | tee checksum-result.log` to create a log file named 'checksum-result.log' with all SHA1 checksums."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can large rsync transfers operate without interruption due to SSH connection loss?",
    "answer": "For a large number of files or very large files, rsync can be run in the background using `screen`, `tmux`, or any other method that allows it to operate despite an SSH connection break."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which utility can be used to find files that do not match after generating checksum logs for two systems?",
    "answer": "The `diff` utility can be used to find files that do not match after generating checksum logs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can false differences be avoided when comparing checksum logs generated by the `find` command?",
    "answer": "To avoid false differences when comparing checksum logs, you should sort both files using `sort -k2` before running the `diff` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does SFTP stand for and what protocol does it use?",
    "answer": "SFTP stands for 'Secure File Transfer Protocol' and it uses the SSH protocol to encrypt transferred data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to a remote server using SFTP?",
    "answer": "You can connect to a remote server using `sftp USERNAME@ADDRESS`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you authenticate an SFTP connection using an SSH key?",
    "answer": "You can authenticate an SFTP connection using an SSH key by adding the `-i` option followed by the path to your private key, for example: `sftp -i /home/name/.ssh/id_rsa USERNAME@ADDRESS`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command allows you to view available transfer commands once connected to SFTP?",
    "answer": "Once connected to SFTP, you can type `help` at the `sftp>` prompt to get a list of available transfer commands."
  },
  {
    "question": "Name some graphical applications for SFTP transfer available on Windows.",
    "answer": "Graphical applications available on Windows for SFTP transfer include WinSCP, MobaXterm, FileZilla, and Cyberduck."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does SCP stand for and what protocol does it use for encryption?",
    "answer": "SCP stands for 'Secure Copy Protocol' and, like SFTP, it uses the SSH protocol to encrypt transferred data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does SCP handle data synchronization?",
    "answer": "No, SCP does not handle data synchronization, unlike Globus or rsync."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I transfer a local file named `foo.txt` to the `work` directory of a user on the `beluga.alliancecan.ca` cluster using SCP?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `scp foo.txt username@beluga.alliancecan.ca:work/` to transfer the file."
  },
  {
    "question": "From which computer should the `scp` command always be launched?",
    "answer": "The `scp` command should always be launched from your local computer, regardless of the data transfer direction."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-r` option in SCP, and why is its use not recommended for `/project` directories?",
    "answer": "The `-r` option allows for recursive transfer of directories and files. It is not recommended for `/project` directories because the `setGID` bit is deactivated in created directories, which can lead to 'Disk quota exceeded' errors during subsequent file creation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I use a custom SSH key for authentication when using SCP?",
    "answer": "If you are using a custom SSH key (not the default names), you must use the SCP option `-i` followed by the path to your private key, for example: `scp -i /path/to/key foo.txt username@beluga.alliancecan.ca:work/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What preventive measure should be taken regarding read permissions before transferring directories?",
    "answer": "Before transferring directories, ensure that you can read all their content. On Linux, you can list unreadable items with `find <directory_name> ! -readable -ls`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be checked if problems occur when writing new data during a transfer?",
    "answer": "If problems occur when writing new data, you should check storage usage and available files, as well as file system permissions to ensure you have write permission at the destination."
