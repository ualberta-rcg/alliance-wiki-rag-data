    "question": "What is IDBA-UD?",
    "answer": "IDBA-UD is an iterative De Bruijn Graph De Novo Assembler for Short Reads Sequencing data with Highly Uneven Sequencing Depth, extending the IDBA algorithm."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does IDBA-UD handle sequencing data with uneven depth?",
    "answer": "IDBA-UD iterates from small to large k-mer values, iteratively removing short and low-depth contigs with cutoff thresholds to reduce errors in low-depth and high-depth regions. It also aligns paired-end reads to contigs and assembles them locally to generate missing k-mers."
