    "question": "What kind of software is IDBA-UD?",
    "answer": "IDBA-UD is an iterative De Bruijn Graph De Novo Assembler for Short Reads Sequencing data, particularly effective with highly uneven sequencing depth."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does IDBA-UD improve assembly quality?",
    "answer": "IDBA-UD improves assembly quality by iteratively removing short and low-depth contigs, and by locally assembling paired-end reads to generate missing k-mers in low-depth regions, allowing for larger k-values with fewer gaps and branches."
