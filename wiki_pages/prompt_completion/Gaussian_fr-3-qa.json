    "question": "How do you restart a Gaussian job from a previous rwf file?",
    "answer": "To restart a Gaussian job, you must first specify the path to the previous %rwf file and modify the keyword line to `#p restart`, followed by a blank line at the end of the input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example of an input file structure for restarting a Gaussian task?",
    "answer": "An example input file for restarting a Gaussian task would include lines like `%rwf=/scratch/yourid/jobid/name.rwf`, `%NoSave`, `%chk=name.chk`, `%mem=5000mb`, `%nprocs=16`, and `#p restart`, with one blank line at the end."
