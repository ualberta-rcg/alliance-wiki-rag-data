    "question": "How can you monitor the progress of a data transfer?",
    "answer": "File size is a good indicator of progress; you should check regularly to see that the transfer process has not stopped."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if a data transfer appears to be stalled?",
    "answer": "If no files have changed size for several minutes, something may have gone wrong. Try restarting the transfer, and if that doesn't work, contact technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long should one expect large data transfers to take?",
    "answer": "Expect hundreds of gigabytes to take hours and terabytes to take days."

    "question": "Is data transfer with Globus always quick for large volumes?",
    "answer": "No, even with Globus, transferring large volumes of data can be time consuming, and specific transfer speeds will vary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps should be taken after data migration to ensure data integrity?",
    "answer": "If you did not use Globus, or if you did but did not check 'verify file integrity', make sure that the data you have transferred are not corrupted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a simple method to check for data corruption after a transfer?",
    "answer": "A crude way to check is to compare file sizes at the source with file sizes at the destination."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you achieve greater assurance of file integrity after migration?",
    "answer": "For greater assurance, you can use `cksum` or `md5sum` at both the source and destination and see if the results match."
  },
  {
    "question": "What action is required if file sizes or checksums do not match after a transfer?",
    "answer": "Any files with mismatching sizes or checksums should be transferred again."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find information on how to use archiving and compression utilities?",
    "answer": "To learn how to use different archiving and compression utilities, use a Linux command like `man <command>` or `<command> --help`."

  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted for further technical assistance?",
    "answer": "Contact our technical support."
