    "question": "How are research groups charged for core equivalents when jobs request portions of them?",
    "answer": "Research groups are charged for the maximum number of core equivalents they take from the resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Alliance's method for accounting system usage address fairness concerns, even if it's not intuitive?",
    "answer": "The method used by the Alliance to account for system usage solves problems about fairness and perceptions of fairness, despite not being initially intuitive."

    "question": "If a research group requests two cores with 2GB of memory per core (total 4GB), and a core equivalent is defined as 1 core and 4GB memory, how many core equivalents will be counted for priority calculation?",
    "answer": "The job request will be counted as 2 core equivalents because it requests 2 core equivalents worth of cores, even though it only uses one bundle for memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a research group requests two cores with 5GB of memory per core (total 10GB), and a core equivalent is defined as 1 core and 4GB memory, how many core equivalents will be counted for priority calculation?",
    "answer": "The job request will be counted as 2.5 core equivalents because it requires 2.5 core equivalents worth of memory, even though it only requests two bundles for cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does accounting for GPU-based allocation targets differ from core equivalents?",
    "answer": "GPU-based allocation targets follow similar principles to core equivalents, but a reference GPU unit (RGU) is added to the resource bundle alongside multiple cores and memory, and the accounting must include the RGU."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are research groups charged when using RGU-core-memory bundles?",
    "answer": "Research groups are charged for the maximum number of RGU-core-memory bundles they use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Given a fictive bundle of 1 RGU, 3 cores, and 4 GB of memory, if a research group requests 2 P100-12gb GPUs (1 RGU each), 3 cores, and 4 GB of memory, how many RGU equivalents will be counted?",
    "answer": "This job request will be counted as 2 RGU equivalents, as the request is for 2 bundles worth of RGUs, which is the maximum compared to memory and cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "Given a fictive bundle of 1 RGU, 3 cores, and 4 GB of memory, if a researcher requests 1 RGU, 5 cores, and 5 GB of memory, how many RGU equivalents will be counted?",
    "answer": "This job request will be counted as 1.66 RGU equivalents because it requires 1.66 bundles worth of cores, which is the maximum component in the request."
  },
  {
    "question": "Given a fictive bundle of 1 RGU, 3 cores, and 4 GB of memory, if a researcher requests 1 RGU, 2 cores, and 6 GB of memory, how many RGU equivalents will be counted?",
    "answer": "This job request will be counted as 1.5 RGU equivalents because it requires 1.5 bundles worth of memory, which is the maximum component in the request."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the RGU equivalent value for a bundle containing one V100-32gb GPU, 7.8 CPU cores, and 10.4 GB of memory on a fictive cluster?",
    "answer": "Such a bundle is worth 2.6 RGU equivalents."
