  {
    "question": "What Julia code can be used to test a CUDA installation?",
    "answer": "You can test the CUDA installation using the following Julia code: `a = CuArray([1,2,3])` followed by `a.+=1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the result of `a = CuArray([1,2,3])` when testing a CUDA installation?",
    "answer": "The result is a 3-element `CuArray{Int64, 1, CUDA.Mem.DeviceBuffer}` containing `1`, `2`, `3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after running `a.+=1` on a `CuArray` during a CUDA installation test?",
    "answer": "After `a.+=1`, the `CuArray` will contain `2`, `3`, `4`."
