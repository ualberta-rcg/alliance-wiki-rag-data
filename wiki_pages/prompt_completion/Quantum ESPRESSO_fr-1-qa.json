    "question": "What is Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "Quantum ESPRESSO is an open-source suite of codes for electronic structure calculation and material modeling at the atomic or microscopic scale. It's based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are Quantum ESPRESSO codes distributed?",
    "answer": "The independent and interoperable codes are distributed under an open-source model."
  },
  {
    "question": "What components are included in the Quantum ESPRESSO suite?",
    "answer": "It includes a core set of components, an ensemble of routines or libraries for advanced tasks, and packages contributed by others."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start using Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "To use the Quantum ESPRESSO suite, you need to load a module."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check available versions of Quantum ESPRESSO modules?",
    "answer": "You can use `module avail quantumespresso` or `module spider quantumespresso`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load a specific version of the Quantum ESPRESSO module?",
    "answer": "You can load a module using a command like `module load quantumespresso/6.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a known problem regarding pseudopotential files for Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "Our clusters do not have a pseudopotential directory for Quantum ESPRESSO; users must find or create and save their own files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of errors can occur with Quantum ESPRESSO compiled with OpenMPI 3.1.2?",
    "answer": "Users have reported random 'segfault' crashes on Cedar when using Quantum ESPRESSO versions compiled with OpenMPI 3.1.2 for single-node tasks (shared memory communication)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended solution for 'segfault' errors with OpenMPI 3.1.2?",
    "answer": "If you encounter such an error, try using a compilation chain based on OpenMPI 2.1.1, for example, by loading `module load gcc/5.4.0`, `module load openmpi/2.1.1`, and `module load quantumespresso/6.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a known parameter error when using Grimme-D3 with Barium (Ba)?",
    "answer": "Yes, incorrect results can be obtained due to an incorrect value for the r2r4 parameter for Barium in the `dft-d3/core.f90` source code file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the correct value for the r2r4 parameter for Barium in Grimme-D3?",
    "answer": "The correct value for the r2r4 parameter is 0.15679528, not 10.1567952."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Quantum ESPRESSO versions are affected by the Grimme-D3 Barium parameter error?",
    "answer": "This error is confirmed in Quantum ESPRESSO versions 6.2.1 through 7.1."
