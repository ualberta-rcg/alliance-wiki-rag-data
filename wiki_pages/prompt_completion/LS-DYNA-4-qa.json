    "question": "How do you access LS-PrePost on cluster nodes?",
    "answer": "To access LS-PrePost on cluster nodes, connect to a compute or login node using TigerVNC, then load the `StdEnv/2020` module, followed by the specific `ls-prepost` module version (e.g., `ls-prepost/4.8` or `ls-prepost/4.9`), and finally run `lsprepost` (or `lspp49` for version 4.9)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to launch LS-PrePost version 4.8 on cluster nodes?",
    "answer": "First, connect to a compute or login node with TigerVNC. Then, in a terminal, run `module load StdEnv/2020`, followed by `module load ls-prepost/4.8`, and finally `lsprepost`."

  {
    "question": "How do you launch LS-PrePost version 4.9 on cluster nodes?",
    "answer": "After connecting to a compute or login node with TigerVNC and loading `StdEnv/2020`, load `module load ls-prepost/4.9` and then run either `lsprepost` or `lspp49`."

  {
    "question": "What is the procedure for using LS-PrePost on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "To use LS-PrePost on VDI nodes, connect to `gra-vdi` using TigerVNC. Open a new terminal and load the `CcEnv StdEnv/2020` modules, followed by the desired `ls-prepost` module version (e.g., `ls-prepost/4.8` or `ls-prepost/4.9`), and then execute `lsprepost` (or `lspp49` for version 4.9)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which commands are needed to run LS-PrePost version 4.8 on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "After connecting to `gra-vdi` with TigerVNC, open a terminal and execute `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2020`, then `module load ls-prepost/4.8`, and finally `lsprepost`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the commands to launch LS-PrePost version 4.9 on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Once connected to `gra-vdi` via TigerVNC and with a terminal open, run `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2020`, then `module load ls-prepost/4.9`, and then either `lsprepost` or `lspp49`."
