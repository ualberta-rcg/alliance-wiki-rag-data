    "answer": "Abaqus FEA is a software suite designed for finite element analysis and computer-aided engineering."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to provide my own Abaqus license to use the software on clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, you must provide your own license to use Abaqus software modules on the clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I configure my account on a cluster to use my Abaqus license?",
    "answer": "Log in to the cluster and create a file named `$HOME/.licenses/abaqus.lic` containing specific license path lines that support versions 202X and 6.14.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What content should the `abaqus.lic` file contain to configure the license?",
    "answer": "The `abaqus.lic` file should contain `prepend_path(\"ABAQUSLM_LICENSE_FILE\",\"port@server\")` and `prepend_path(\"LM_LICENSE_FILE\",\"port@server\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information should replace `port@server` in the `abaqus.lic` file?",
    "answer": "You should replace `port@server` with the flexlm port number and the server IP address (or fully qualified hostname) of your Abaqus license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are needed if my Abaqus license is not yet configured for use on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "Additional configuration changes by both the Alliance system administrator and your local system administrator will be necessary to ensure the flexlm and vendor TCP ports of your Abaqus server are reachable from all cluster compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information should I provide to technical support to get my Abaqus license configured for an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "You need to provide the flexlm port number, static vendor port number, and the IP address of your Abaqus license server to technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required before a local Abaqus license can be used remotely on Alliance hardware?",
    "answer": "A special license agreement must generally be negotiated and signed by SIMULIA and your institution."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are prototype Slurm scripts used for in Abaqus?",
    "answer": "Prototype Slurm scripts are used for submitting thread and MPI-based parallel simulations to single or multiple compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "For most users, which type of Slurm script is sufficient for Abaqus job submission?",
    "answer": "Most users will find it sufficient to use one of the **project directory scripts** provided in the *Single node computing* sections."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the optional `memory=` argument in Abaqus Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "The `memory=` argument is intended for larger memory or problematic jobs where the 3072MB offset value may require tuning."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I obtain a listing of all Abaqus command line arguments?",
    "answer": "Load an Abaqus module and run the command `abaqus -help | less`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which script should be used for single node Abaqus jobs that run for less than one day?",
    "answer": "Single node jobs that run for less than one day should use the *project directory script* located in the first tab."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should restart scripts be used for single node Abaqus jobs?",
    "answer": "Single node jobs that run for more than a day should use one of the restart scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can jobs that create large restart files benefit from writing to local disk?",
    "answer": "Jobs that create large restart files can benefit by writing to the local disk through the use of the `SLURM_TMPDIR` environment variable, which is utilized in the temporary directory scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of restart scripts in Abaqus?",
    "answer": "Restart scripts will continue jobs that have been terminated early, for reasons such as reaching maximum requested runtime or compute node crashes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of parallelization do Abaqus solvers support for Standard Analysis?",
    "answer": "Abaqus solvers support thread-based and MPI-based parallelization for Standard Analysis type jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are multiple node job restart scripts currently provided for Standard Analysis?",
    "answer": "No, scripts to perform multiple node job restarts are not currently provided for Standard Analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a typical Slurm header for a single node Abaqus Standard Analysis project directory script?",
    "answer": "A typical Slurm header includes `#SBATCH --account=def-group`, `#SBATCH --time=00-06:00`, `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4`, `#SBATCH --mem=8G`, and `#SBATCH --nodes=1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify in an Abaqus input file to write restart data every 12 time increments?",
    "answer": "You specify `*RESTART, WRITE, OVERLAY, FREQUENCY=12` in the input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify in an Abaqus input file to write restart data for a total of 12 time increments?",
    "answer": "You specify `*RESTART, WRITE, OVERLAY, NUMBER INTERVAL=12, TIME MARKS=NO` in the input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check for completed restart information in Abaqus output files?",
    "answer": "You can check by running the command `egrep -i \"step|start\" testsp*.com testsp*.msg testsp*.sta`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Abaqus command argument might improve performance for some simulations?",
    "answer": "Adding `order_parallel=OFF` to the Abaqus command at the bottom of the script might benefit some simulations."
