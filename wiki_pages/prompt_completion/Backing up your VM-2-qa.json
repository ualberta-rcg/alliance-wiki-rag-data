    "question": "How can you re-create a virtual machine after backing up its volumes as images?",
    "answer": "Once images of all desired volumes have been created, you can re-create your VM by booting from the original VM's root volume and attaching any additional volumes that were originally connected."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of a volume snapshot in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "A volume snapshot saves the state of a volume at the time it was created."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are OpenStack volume snapshots recommended for backup purposes?",
    "answer": "No, volume snapshots are not ideal for backups because they depend on the original volume remaining intact and cannot be downloaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to download OpenStack volume snapshots?",
    "answer": "No, it is not possible to download OpenStack volume snapshots as they depend on the original volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a practical use case for creating a new volume from a volume snapshot?",
    "answer": "You can create a new volume from a snapshot to revert file changes since the last volume snapshot or to isolate file changes specific to a VM that should not be included in other VMs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does OpenStack distinguish between 'volume snapshots' and 'VM snapshots'?",
    "answer": "OpenStack uses the word 'snapshot' to mean two different things: volume snapshots (discussed previously) and snapshots of VMs, which behave differently depending on the VM's flavor."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does OpenStack create when you take a snapshot of a persistent VM?",
    "answer": "When you take a snapshot of a persistent VM, OpenStack creates a nearly empty image containing pointers to volume snapshots of the persistent VM's boot volume and any attached volumes that were created as part of the VM snapshot."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you restore or create a new VM from a persistent VM snapshot?",
    "answer": "You can create a new VM by booting from the image generated by the persistent VM snapshot (which creates new volumes from the associated volume snapshots), then boot the new VM from its root volume and attach any other duplicated volumes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary goal when backing up Compute VMs?",
    "answer": "The main goal when backing up Compute VMs is to create an image of at least the root drive, and possibly other attached volumes if necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Compute VMs boot differently compared to persistent VMs?",
    "answer": "Compute VMs are meant to be booted from disk images that reside locally on the computer running the VM, rather than from volumes accessed over the network like persistent VMs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you create an image of a Compute VM's root disk?",
    "answer": "You can create an image of a Compute VM's root disk by clicking 'Create Snapshot' from your VM's drop-down menu on the 'Instances' tab in the OpenStack dashboard."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of data does a snapshot of a Compute VM contain?",
    "answer": "A snapshot of a Compute VM creates an image that contains a copy of the VM's root drive, unlike persistent VM snapshots which are nearly empty images with pointers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the extra data drive mounted on Compute VMs?",
    "answer": "Compute VMs come with an extra data drive mounted at `/mnt`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the data on the `/mnt` drive of a Compute VM included in its snapshot image?",
    "answer": "No, the data on the `/mnt` drive of a Compute VM is not captured in the image created from a Compute VM snapshot."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should data on the `/mnt` drive of a Compute VM be saved?",
    "answer": "Other arrangements, such as copying the data off the disk before the VM is terminated, must be made to save data from the `/mnt` drive."
  },
  {
    "question": "What challenge do very large disk images pose in backup strategies?",
    "answer": "Very large disk images (larger than 10-20 GB) can be difficult to manage due to relatively long upload and VM creation times."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a good basic strategy for backing up large disk images?",
    "answer": "A good basic strategy is to separate large data sets from your operating system and software stack."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the operating system and software stack be backed up in this strategy?",
    "answer": "The operating system and software stack can be backed up either using a disk image or recreated using provisioning software."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should large data sets be backed up in the example strategy?",
    "answer": "Large data sets should be backed up using normal file backup methods to a remote location."
  },
  {
    "question": "What additional step is recommended for backing up database software like MySQL or PostgreSQL?",
    "answer": "If using database software like MySQL or PostgreSQL, you should create dumps of the databases to include in your backups."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most crucial step in any backup strategy?",
    "answer": "The most important step in any backup strategy is to test restoring from your backup."
