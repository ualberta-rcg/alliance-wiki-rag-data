  {
    "question": "What is ARM DDT?",
    "answer": "ARM DDT (formerly known as Allinea DDT) is a powerful commercial parallel debugger with a graphical user interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of programs can ARM DDT debug?",
    "answer": "ARM DDT can debug serial, MPI, multi-threaded, and CUDA programs, or any combination of the above, written in C, C++, and FORTRAN."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is MAP?",
    "answer": "MAP (formerly Allinea) is an efficient parallel profiler from ARM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the available modules for debugging and profiling on Nibi and Trillium?",
    "answer": "The available modules are 'ddt-cpu' for CPU debugging and profiling, and 'ddt-gpu' for GPU or mixed CPU/GPU debugging."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should I log in to use a GUI application like DDT or MAP to ensure proper X11 tunnelling?",
    "answer": "You should log in using `ssh -Y` and use an SSH client like MobaXTerm (Windows) or XQuartz (Mac) to ensure proper X11 tunnelling."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are DDT and MAP typically used interactively?",
    "answer": "Both DDT and MAP are normally used interactively through their GUI, which is typically accomplished using the `salloc` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can MAP be used non-interactively?",
    "answer": "Yes, MAP can also be used non-interactively, in which case it can be submitted to the scheduler with the `sbatch` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the current license limits for DDT/MAP use?",
    "answer": "The current license limits the use of DDT/MAP to a maximum of 64 CPU cores across all users at any given time, while DDT-GPU is limited to 8 GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to debug CPU-only code using DDT/MAP?",
    "answer": "The first step is to allocate the node or nodes on which to do the debugging or profiling using `salloc`, which will open a shell session on the allocated node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example `salloc` command for CPU-only code debugging?",
    "answer": "An example `salloc` command for CPU-only code debugging is `salloc --x11 --time=0-1:00 --mem-per-cpu=4G --ntasks=4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which module should be loaded for CPU-only debugging and profiling?",
    "answer": "For CPU-only debugging and profiling, you should load the `ddt-cpu` module."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run DDT or MAP after loading the appropriate module for CPU-only code?",
    "answer": "You run them by executing `ddt path/to/code` or `map path/to/code`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What configuration should be checked in the DDT/MAP application window for MPI programs?",
    "answer": "You should make sure the MPI implementation is the default OpenMPI, and if not, change it from the drop-down menu. Also, specify the desired number of CPU cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a known compatibility issue between current versions of DDT and OpenMPI, and what is the workaround?",
    "answer": "Yes, there is a compatibility issue that breaks displaying message queues. The workaround is to execute `export OMPI_MCA_pml=ob1` before running DDT."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a potential drawback of using the OpenMPI compatibility workaround?",
    "answer": "The workaround (`export OMPI_MCA_pml=ob1`) can make your MPI code run slower, so it should only be used when debugging."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `salloc` command is used to allocate resources for CUDA code debugging?",
    "answer": "An example `salloc` command for CUDA code debugging is `salloc --x11 --time=0-1:00 --mem-per-cpu=4G --ntasks=1 --gres=gpu:1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which module should be loaded for GPU or mixed CPU/GPU debugging?",
    "answer": "You should load the `ddt-gpu` module for GPU or mixed CPU/GPU debugging."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do if loading `ddt-gpu` fails with a suggestion to load an older OpenMPI version?",
    "answer": "You should reload the OpenMPI module with the suggested command (e.g., `module load openmpi/2.0.2`), and then reload the `ddt-gpu` module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What other module is required for CUDA code debugging?",
    "answer": "A `cuda` module must be loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command should be executed if DDT complains about a mismatch between the CUDA driver and toolkit version?",
    "answer": "If DDT complains about a mismatch, execute `export ALLINEA_FORCE_CUDA_VERSION=<version>` (e.g., `export ALLINEA_FORCE_CUDA_VERSION=10.1`) and then run DDT again."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might the DDT graphical interface be laggy, and how can this be addressed?",
    "answer": "The DDT interface might be laggy due to X11 forwarding's sensitivity to packet latency. This can be fixed by running DDT under VNC."
