    "question": "What is the primary purpose of this guidance page?",
    "answer": "This page provides guidance based on user experiences with Compute Canada's cloud instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is updating packages generally safe and recommended?",
    "answer": "Yes, updating packages is often a safe operation and is recommended for security reasons."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is upgrading a major operating system version a good security measure?",
    "answer": "Upgrading from one major version of an operating system to the next is a good security measure, but it can often cause problems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What critical step should be taken before performing a major operating system upgrade?",
    "answer": "Before doing any major operating system upgrades, create a backup of your VM so that you can recover if the process fails."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should a second volume for data be considered for VMs without bounded storage requirements?",
    "answer": "It is very difficult to expand a root volume, so for any VM which does not have bounded storage requirements, creating a second volume for data is recommended."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a data volume be expanded if more space is needed?",
    "answer": "If more space is needed and your allocation has enough remaining volume storage, it is fairly straightforward to expand the data volume using OpenStack, and then expand the logical volume and filesystem within your VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommendation regarding the maximum number of volumes to attach to a VM?",
    "answer": "Avoid attaching more than three volumes to a VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What issues can arise from attaching more than three volumes to a VM?",
    "answer": "Attaching more than three volumes has been observed to lead to kernel timeouts, affecting disk operations, potentially causing a cascading effect, and rendering the VM effectively inoperative."
  },
  {
    "question": "If using a data volume, how many should be used, and how can storage be managed within it?",
    "answer": "If using a data volume, use only one, and you can carve it up into multiple filesystems inside your VM and expand it as necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where have problems with multiple volumes been observed?",
    "answer": "Issues with multiple volumes have been observed on Arbutus (arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca) by multiple users."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example of the issues caused by multiple volumes on Arbutus?",
    "answer": "In one case on Arbutus, 3 x 100GB volumes attached to a p4-6gb VM caused kernel timeouts whenever disk operations were attempted, making it very difficult to copy more than 500MB of data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did a similar multiple volume issue occur on the East cloud?",
    "answer": "No, a test on East cloud with 4 x 100GB data volumes (along with the root volume), the same OS, and a similar VM flavour did not show the issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "Was memory considered a factor in the multiple volume issue observed on Arbutus?",
    "answer": "High memory usage was not observed in the Arbutus case and is not believed to be a factor."
