    "question": "What is Abaqus FEA?",
    "answer": "Abaqus FEA is a software suite designed for finite element analysis and computer-aided engineering."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to use Abaqus software modules on clusters?",
    "answer": "You must provide your own license to use Abaqus software modules on clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure your account to use your own Abaqus license on a cluster?",
    "answer": "Log in to a cluster and create a file named `$HOME/.licenses/abaqus.lic`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should the `abaqus.lic` file contain for license configuration?",
    "answer": "The `abaqus.lic` file should contain these two lines: `prepend_path(\"ABAQUSLM_LICENSE_FILE\",\"port@server\")` and `prepend_path(\"LM_LICENSE_FILE\",\"port@server\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information needs to be customized in the `abaqus.lic` file?",
    "answer": "You need to replace `port@server` with the flexlm port number and the server's IP address (or fully qualified hostname) of your Abaqus license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are needed if your Abaqus license hasn't been set up for use on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "Additional configuration changes by both the Alliance system administrator and your local system administrator are required to ensure the flexlm and vendor TCP ports of your Abaqus server are reachable from all cluster compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should you contact for help with Abaqus license setup on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "You should write to technical support for assistance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What three items should be included in your request to technical support for Abaqus license setup on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "You should include the flexlm port number, static vendor port number, and the IP address of your Abaqus license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `memory=` argument in Abaqus Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "The optional `memory=` argument is intended for larger memory or problematic jobs where the 3072MB offset value might need tuning."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users obtain a listing of all Abaqus command line arguments?",
    "answer": "A listing of all Abaqus command line arguments can be obtained by loading an Abaqus module and running: `abaqus -help | less`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which type of script is sufficient for single node jobs running less than one day?",
    "answer": "For single node jobs that run less than one day, the 'project directory script' located in the first tab should be sufficient."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of script should be used for single node jobs that run for more than a day?",
    "answer": "Single node jobs that run for more than a day should use one of the restart scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can jobs that create large restart files benefit from specific script types?",
    "answer": "Jobs that create large restart files will benefit by writing to the local disk through the use of the `SLURM_TMPDIR` environment variable utilized in the 'temporary directory scripts'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of restart scripts?",
    "answer": "Restart scripts are designed to continue jobs that have been terminated early for reasons like reaching maximum requested runtime or a compute node crash."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should MPI scripts be used for Abaqus jobs?",
    "answer": "MPI scripts in the 'multiple node sections' should be used for jobs that require large memory or larger compute resources beyond what a single compute node can provide."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done before running long multi-node jobs to ensure optimal performance?",
    "answer": "Short scaling test jobs should be run to determine wall-clock times and memory requirements as a function of the number of cores (2, 4, 8, etc.) to determine the optimal number."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of parallelization do Abaqus solvers support for Standard Analysis?",
    "answer": "Abaqus solvers support thread-based and MPI-based parallelization for Standard Analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are scripts for multiple node job restarts currently provided for Standard Analysis?",
    "answer": "No, scripts to perform multiple node job restarts are not currently provided for Standard Analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical SBATCH parameters specified in a 'project directory script' for single node standard analysis?",
    "answer": "Typical SBATCH parameters include `--account`, `--time`, `--cpus-per-task`, `--mem`, and `--nodes` (which should be set to 1)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which environment modules are loaded in the example 'project directory script' for Abaqus 2021?",
    "answer": "The script loads `StdEnv/2020` and `abaqus/2021`."
