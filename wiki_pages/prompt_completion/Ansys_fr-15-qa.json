    "question": "What should I do if I encounter an 'Error segmentation violation - exiting after doing an emergency save' message when launching icemcfd?",
    "answer": "Do not click the OK button. Instead, go to the 'Settings Tab', then 'Display', tick 'X11', click 'Apply', then 'OK', and finally 'File -> Exit'. The error should not occur on subsequent launches."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I start Mapdl graphically on VDI nodes using StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "First, load the modules `CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions). Then, you can either run `mapdl -g` to start the GUI directly, or `unset SESSION_MANAGER; launcher -> click RUN button`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules should I load to run Workbench graphically on VDI nodes using SnEnv?",
    "answer": "You should load `SnEnv` and `ansys/2024R.04` (or older versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands can I use to launch Workbench on VDI nodes with SnEnv modules?",
    "answer": "You can use `runwb2` or `runwb2-gui`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default license server used by `runwb2` when loading Ansys modules installed locally via `SnEnv`?",
    "answer": "The `runwb2` command from `SnEnv` modules uses the SHARCNET license server by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I use a remote license server when launching Workbench with locally installed Ansys modules via `SnEnv`?",
    "answer": "Launch Workbench using `runwb2-gui`. This script will read your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file for license information or offer an interactive option to use the CMC server."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are required to run Workbench graphically on VDI nodes for Ansys 2025R1 and newer versions?",
    "answer": "You need to load `CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2025R1` (or newer versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to launch Workbench on VDI nodes with Ansys 2025R1 or newer?",
    "answer": "The command is `runwb2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Ansys Workbench 2025R1 available on the SHARCNET license server?",
    "answer": "No, it is not available on the SHARCNET license server before its update."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I prevent the 'Warning: Software rasterizer found, hardware acceleration will be disabled' message when starting Fluent from Workbench 2025R1 on VDI?",
    "answer": "Before clicking 'Start' in the Fluent Launcher, go to the 'Environment' tab and copy/paste `HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` into the empty input field. Alternatively, you can define `export HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` in your environment before starting Workbench."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the maximum core limits for running Mechanical and Fluent in Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "For Mechanical, the maximum is 24 cores (ensure 'Distributed' is checked). For Fluent, the maximum is 12 cores (ensure 'Distributed' is NOT checked)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the memory limit for Ansys simulations on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Do not attempt to use more than 128GB of memory; otherwise, Ansys will reach the limit and be stopped."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I need more cores or memory than what's available on gra-vdi for my Ansys Workbench session?",
    "answer": "You should use a compute node on a cluster to execute your graphical session."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many cores should I use for Ansys pre-processing or post-processing tasks on gra-vdi that do not involve calculations?",
    "answer": "You should only use 4 cores to avoid unnecessarily drawing HPC licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if the Workbench GUI or other Ansys programs freeze or fail to start correctly on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Open a new terminal window on gra-vdi and execute `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|fluent|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE|mono\"` to stop all Ansys processes completely."
  },
  {
    "question": "If Ansys GUI issues persist on gra-vdi after stopping processes, especially if I previously used a compute node for GUI work, what can I try?",
    "answer": "Try running `rm -rf .ansys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What could cause Ansys processes to remain in memory on gra-vdi even after a session ends?",
    "answer": "A process might remain in memory if an Ansys GUI session (Fluent, Workbench, etc.) is not properly terminated before vncviewer is manually or unexpectedly closed, for example due to a temporary network outage or a stalled file system."
