    "question": "What modes of simulation does Ansys Rocky support?",
    "answer": "Ansys Rocky can execute simulations in both graphical and non-graphical modes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does Ansys Rocky support GPU acceleration?",
    "answer": "Yes, Ansys Rocky supports execution using only processors or with a combination of processors and GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which cluster are the provided Ansys Rocky Slurm scripts currently usable?",
    "answer": "The provided Ansys Rocky Slurm scripts are currently only usable on the Graham cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I view a complete list of command-line options for Ansys Rocky?",
    "answer": "After loading an Ansys Rocky module, you can execute 'Rocky -h' on the command line to get a complete list of options. Currently, 'ansysrocky/2023R2' is available on Graham for this purpose."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the CPU requirements for Ansys Rocky when solving coupled problems with GPUs?",
    "answer": "When solving coupled problems with GPUs, the number of CPUs requested on the same node should be increased to the maximum until the scalability limit of the coupled application is reached."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the CPU requirements for Ansys Rocky when solving decoupled, standalone problems with GPUs?",
    "answer": "For decoupled, standalone problems with GPUs, only a minimal number of CPUs should be requested (e.g., 2 or 3) to allow Rocky to function optimally."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are 'rocky_hpc' licenses necessary for Ansys Rocky?",
