    "question": "How do users typically interact with Alliance servers?",
    "answer": "Users interact by entering commands via a console, which is called a command-line interface, rather than through graphical user interfaces."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do programs on Alliance servers not always execute immediately?",
    "answer": "Programs are placed in a queue and are executed when CPU cores become available, which helps to avoid interference and a decrease in performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three main steps to use the command-line interface for tasks?",
    "answer": "The steps are: preparing a script, submitting it to a scheduler, and retrieving the result once the task is completed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can users interact with a program while a task is running?",
    "answer": "Users usually do not interact with the program during its execution, but they can inquire about its progression."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of lines beginning with '#SBATCH' in a task script?",
    "answer": "Lines beginning with '#SBATCH' are directives that inform the scheduler about the task to be executed, such as its execution time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the primary functions of a task scheduler?",
    "answer": "A task scheduler maintains a database of tasks, applies rules regarding limits and priorities, prevents resource overload, determines which tasks to run on which nodes, launches tasks on appropriate nodes, and cleans up after task completion."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which task scheduling solution is used for Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "Slurm Workload Manager has been adopted as the task scheduling solution for Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request necessary resources for a calculation?",
    "answer": "You request necessary resources for a calculation by using a task script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the common parameters of a task that can be specified?",
    "answer": "The common parameters of a task are the execution time and the number of processors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a task's specified time or memory is less than its actual requirements?",
    "answer": "If the specified values are lower than what the calculations demand, and the task exceeds the specified time or memory, it will be stopped."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the downside of requesting more resources than a task actually needs?",
    "answer": "If more resources (time or memory) are requested than needed, the task might stay in the queue longer and its execution would use resources that could have been available for other tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default number of processors allocated if not specified in a task script?",
    "answer": "If the number of processors is not specified in a task script, a single processor will be allocated by default."
