    "question": "What are SLURM Raw Shares for rrg-* or rpp-* accounts?",
    "answer": "For rrg-* or rpp-* accounts, SLURM Raw Shares are a straight line corresponding to the account's resource allocation on the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are SLURM Raw Shares determined for default accounts?",
    "answer": "For default accounts, SLURM Raw Shares are dynamic over time, based on the number of active accounts on the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of plotting SLURM Raw Shares for a default account?",
    "answer": "Plotting the SLURM Raw Shares of a default account on a specific cluster is an easy way to determine the expected usage that can be achieved by that account on the given cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is SLURM Raw Usage?",
    "answer": "SLURM Raw Usage is a metric that the scheduling software uses to determine the priority of accounts."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is SLURM Raw Usage calculated?",
    "answer": "SLURM Raw Usage is the cumulative sum of the account's usage in billing units plus a half-life decay period."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is an account's usage considered at par with its target share based on SLURM Raw Usage?",
    "answer": "An account's usage is considered at par with its target share if the SLURM Raw Usage is at 10 times the SLURM Raw Shares."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you select a specific cluster in the usage portal?",
    "answer": "You can select a specific cluster using the 'System' pull-down menu in the 'Select system and dates' panel."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the time interval displayed in the usage figure be changed?",
    "answer": "The time interval can be changed using the 'Start date (incl.)' and 'End date (incl.)' fields in the 'Select system and dates' panel."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of jobs are included in the usage figure for a selected time interval?",
    "answer": "The figure includes all jobs on the specified cluster that were in a running (R) or pending (PD) state during the selected time interval, including both the start and end date."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does selecting an end date in the future for the usage figure display?",
    "answer": "Selecting an end date in the future will display a 'projection' of currently running and pending jobs for their requested duration into the future."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the transparent red area labeled 'Projection' in the usage figure indicate?",
    "answer": "The 'Projection' area indicates future time, where each job is assumed to run to its requested time limit, and pending jobs are assumed to start at the beginning of the projected time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the usage projections intended to be actual forecasts of future events?",
    "answer": "No, the usage projections are not intended to be a forecast of actual future events."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which metrics can be selected in the 'Parameters' panel of the usage portal?",
    "answer": "You can select from CPU, CPU-equivalent, RGU, RGU-equivalent, Memory, Billing, GPU, and all specific GPU models available on the selected cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between 'Total' and 'Running total' summation options in the usage figure?",
    "answer": "If 'Total' is selected, each bar shows the usage for that single day; if 'Running total' is selected, each bar represents the sum of that day's usage and all previous days back to the beginning of the time interval."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the 'Allocation Target' displayed when 'Running total' summation is active?",
    "answer": "If the 'Allocation Target' is displayed with 'Running total' summation, it is similarly adjusted to show the running total of the target usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users choose to include or exclude running jobs from the usage figure?",
    "answer": "Users can include running jobs by setting 'Include Running jobs' to 'Yes' or exclude them by setting it to 'No'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the running total histogram show when displaying a single account's usage alongside its 'Allocation target'?",
    "answer": "It displays how an account deviates from its target share over the period shown."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is expected of the usage cumulative sum when an account is submitting jobs requesting more than its target share, if the scheduler manages fair share properly?",
    "answer": "If the scheduler is managing fair share properly, the usage cumulative sum is expected to oscillate above and below the target share cumulative sum."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended time interval to inspect the scheduler's performance in maintaining an account's fair share?",
    "answer": "A good interval to inspect the scheduler\u2019s performance in maintaining the account's fair share is to display the past 30 days, due to the decay period for the impact of past usage."
