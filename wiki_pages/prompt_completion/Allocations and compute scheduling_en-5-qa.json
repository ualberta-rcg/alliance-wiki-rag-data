    "question": "What do the SLURM Raw Shares represent for an allocation (rrg-* or rpp-*) account?",
    "answer": "For an allocation (rrg-* or rpp-*) account, the SLURM Raw Shares are a straight line that corresponds to the account's resource allocation on the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are SLURM Raw Shares determined for default accounts?",
    "answer": "For default accounts, SLURM Raw Shares are dynamic over time and based on the number of active accounts on the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of plotting the SLURM Raw Shares of a default account?",
    "answer": "Plotting the SLURM Raw Shares of a default account on a specific cluster is an easy way to determine the expected usage that can be achieved by that default account on a given cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is SLURM Raw Usage?",
    "answer": "SLURM Raw Usage is a metric used by the scheduling software to determine account priority, calculated as the cumulative sum of the account's usage in billing units plus a half-life decay period."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is plotting an account's SLURM Raw Usage useful?",
    "answer": "Plotting an account's SLURM Raw Usage is a convenient way to assess how past usage influences the account's priority over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the rule of thumb for determining if an account's usage is at its target share, based on SLURM Raw Usage and SLURM Raw Shares?",
    "answer": "A good rule of thumb is that if the SLURM Raw Usage is at 10 times the SLURM Raw Shares, then the account's usage is at par with its target share (i.e., the usage rate the scheduler will try to maintain)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is displayed in the figure on the portal?",
    "answer": "The figure shows your usage for a single cluster over a specified time interval."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you select a specific cluster to view usage data?",
    "answer": "You can select a specific cluster using the 'System' pull-down menu, which lists active national clusters that use Slurm as a scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you change the time interval for the displayed usage data?",
    "answer": "You can change the time interval by using the 'Start date (incl.)' and 'End date (incl.)' fields in the 'Select system and dates' panel."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of jobs are included in the displayed usage data?",
    "answer": "The displayed usage data includes all jobs on the specified cluster that were in a running (R) or pending (PD) state during the selected time interval, including both the start and end dates."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if you select an end date in the future for viewing usage data?",
    "answer": "Selecting an end date in the future will display a projection of currently running and pending jobs for their requested duration into the future."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is usage over an extended time period into the future visualized in the portal?",
    "answer": "If an end time after the present is selected, the figure will have a transparent red area overlaid on the future time, labeled 'Projection'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What assumptions are made for the 'Projection' period in the usage figure?",
    "answer": "In the 'Projection' period, each job is assumed to run to its requested time limit, and for queued resources, each pending job is supposed to start immediately and run until its requested time limit."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the usage projection intended to be an accurate forecast of future events?",
    "answer": "No, the usage projection is not intended to be a forecast of actual future events."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can you select different metrics to display in the usage figure?",
    "answer": "You can select different metrics using the 'Metric' pull-down control in the 'Parameters' panel."
  },
  {
    "question": "What metrics are available for display in the usage figure?",
    "answer": "Available metrics include CPU, CPU-equivalent, RGU, RGU-equivalent, Memory, Billing, GPU, and all specific GPU models available on the selected cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you switch between daily 'Total' and 'Running total' for usage summation?",
    "answer": "You can switch between 'Total' and 'Running total' using the 'Summation' pull-down menu."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Total' summation represent in the usage histogram?",
    "answer": "If 'Total' is selected for summation, each bar of the histogram represents the total usage in that one day."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Running total' summation represent in the usage histogram?",
    "answer": "If 'Running total' is selected, each bar represents the sum of that day's usage and all previous days back to the beginning of the time interval."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the 'Allocation Target' display when 'Running total' summation is selected?",
    "answer": "If the 'Allocation Target' is displayed with 'Running total' summation, it is similarly adjusted to show the running total of the target usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view data only from completed jobs in the usage figure?",
    "answer": "You can view data only from completed jobs by setting 'Include Running jobs' to 'No'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you include data from running jobs in the usage figure?",
    "answer": "You can include data from running jobs by setting 'Include Running jobs' to 'Yes'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does displaying the 'Running total' of usage alongside the 'Allocation target' for a single account show?",
    "answer": "It shows how an account deviates from its target share over the period displayed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of values are presented in the 'Running total' view for usage and allocation target?",
    "answer": "The values in this view are the cumulative sum across days from the 'total' summation view for both the usage and allocation target."
  },
  {
    "question": "What pattern is expected in the cumulative usage sum if the scheduler is properly managing fair share?",
    "answer": "When an account submits jobs requesting more than its target share, it is expected that the usage cumulative sum will oscillate above and below the target share cumulative sum if the scheduler is managing fair share properly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended time interval for inspecting the scheduler's performance in maintaining an account's fair share?",
    "answer": "A good interval to use is the past 30 days, as the scheduler uses a decay period for the impact of past usage."
