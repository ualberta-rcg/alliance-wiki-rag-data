    "question": "What is Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale, based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the foundational principles of Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "Quantum ESPRESSO is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the Quantum ESPRESSO software distributed?",
    "answer": "The Quantum ESPRESSO distribution consists of a 'historical' core set of components, a set of plug-ins for advanced tasks, and various third-party packages designed for interoperability with the core components."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I make Quantum ESPRESSO available for use?",
    "answer": "You need to load a module, for example, using `module load quantumespresso/6.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check the available versions of Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "You can see available versions using `module avail quantumespresso` or `module spider quantumespresso`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example SLURM command to run a Quantum ESPRESSO job?",
    "answer": "An example command in a SLURM script is `srun pw.x < si.scf.in > si.scf.out` after loading the necessary modules like `quantumespresso/6.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many MPI tasks are requested in the provided Quantum ESPRESSO SLURM example script?",
    "answer": "The example SLURM script requests 32 MPI tasks per node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the number of processes in the example script always suitable for Quantum ESPRESSO jobs?",
    "answer": "No, the example requests 32 processes, which is more than needed for the silicon tutorial case, and users are responsible for choosing an efficient number."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are pseudopotential files available system-wide for Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "No, there is no system-wide repository of pseudopotentials for Quantum ESPRESSO on our clusters. Users must find or create and store their own."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of problem can occur when running Grimme-D3 with barium (Ba) in Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "Incorrect results may be obtained when running Grimme-D3 with barium (Ba) due to an incorrect value for the r2r4 parameter in the source code file `dft-d3/core.f90`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the correct value for the `r2r4` parameter for barium in Grimme-D3?",
    "answer": "The correct value for the `r2r4` parameter should be 10.15679528, not 0.15679528."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Quantum ESPRESSO versions are affected by the Grimme-D3 barium parameter error?",
    "answer": "The error has been confirmed by QE developers to exist in all versions from 6.2.1 to 7.1."
