    "question": "What is Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale."
  },
  {
    "question": "What fundamental theories and methods does Quantum ESPRESSO use?",
    "answer": "It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution structured?",
    "answer": "The Quantum ESPRESSO distribution consists of a \"historical\" core set of components, a set of plug-ins for advanced tasks, and a number of third-party packages designed to be inter-operable with the core components."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you begin using Quantum ESPRESSO?",
