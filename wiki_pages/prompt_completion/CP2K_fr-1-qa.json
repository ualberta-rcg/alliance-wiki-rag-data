  },
  {
    "question": "Is an Intel-compiled version of CP2K available, and are there any issues with it?",
    "answer": "Yes, an Intel-compiled version is available, but it appears to be less stable and occasionally crashes for unknown reasons."
  },

    "answer": "To load the Intel-compiled version of CP2K 8.2, use the command: `module load StdEnv/2020 intel/2020.1.217 openmpi/4.0.3 cp2k/8.2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find an example of a static calculation for CP2K?",
    "answer": "An example of a static calculation is available on the CP2K website at `https://www.cp2k.org/howto:static_calculation`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the commands to download and prepare the example static calculation files?",
    "answer": "First, `wget https://www.cp2k.org/_media/static_calculation.tgz`, then `tar xvfz static_calculation.tgz`, and finally `cd static_calculation/sample_output_no_smearing`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `mpi_job.sh` script in the example task?",
    "answer": "The `mpi_job.sh` script is a job submission script for a static calculation using CP2K in an MPI environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many MPI processes are requested in the `mpi_job.sh` example script?",
    "answer": "The `mpi_job.sh` script requests 4 MPI processes (`#SBATCH --ntasks=4`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the memory requested per CPU in the `mpi_job.sh` example?",
    "answer": "The `mpi_job.sh` script requests 4GB of memory per CPU (`#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4G`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the time limit for the `mpi_job.sh` example job?",
    "answer": "The time limit specified in the `mpi_job.sh` script is 0 days, 0 hours, and 15 minutes (`#SBATCH --time=0-00:15`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you submit the `mpi_job.sh` task?",
    "answer": "To submit the task, run the command `sbatch mpi_job.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check if a submitted task is complete?",
    "answer": "Run the command `sq`. Your task is finished if it does not appear in the list."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are the CP2K calculation results saved for the static calculation example?",
    "answer": "The CP2K results will be saved in the file `Si_bulk8.out`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `slurm-*.out` file and what does it indicate?",
    "answer": "The `slurm-*.out` file is a results file that will be empty if the calculation was completed without errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which executables does CP2K version 8.2 provide for calculations?",
    "answer": "Starting from version 8.2, CP2K provides `cp2k.popt` and the OpenMP/MPI executable `cp2k.psmp`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can `cp2k.psmp` potentially improve performance?",
    "answer": "The `cp2k.psmp` executable can improve the performance of certain calculations, such as the QS/H2O-512.inp test, where a 10% improvement was observed using 2 threads per MPI process compared to `cp2k.popt` with MPI alone."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `openmp_mpi_job.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The `openmp_mpi_job.sh` script is an example OpenMP/MPI job submission file designed for tasks on B\u00e9luga, though it can be adapted for other clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many nodes are requested in the `openmp_mpi_job.sh` example script?",
    "answer": "The `openmp_mpi_job.sh` script requests 2 nodes (`#SBATCH --nodes=2`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many MPI processes are requested in the `openmp_mpi_job.sh` example?",
    "answer": "The `openmp_mpi_job.sh` script requests 40 MPI processes (`#SBATCH --ntasks=40`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPUs per task are allocated in the `openmp_mpi_job.sh` example?",
    "answer": "The `openmp_mpi_job.sh` script allocates 2 CPUs per task (`-cpus-per-task=2`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variable is used to set the number of OpenMP threads in `openmp_mpi_job.sh`?",
    "answer": "The `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable is set to `$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` to control OpenMP threads."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to test both `cp2k.popt` and `cp2k.psmp` for a given problem?",
    "answer": "It's important to test both `cp2k.popt` and `cp2k.psmp` because the performance difference with threads depends on the problem, and `cp2k.psmp` can sometimes take longer, requiring testing to choose the best option."
