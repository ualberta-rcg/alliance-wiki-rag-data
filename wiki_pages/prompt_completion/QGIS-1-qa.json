  },
  {
    "question": "On what type of node should QGIS GUI visualization be performed?",
    "answer": "If you must visualize your data using the GUI, please do so on an interactive node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if parallel rendering is used on shared login nodes?",
    "answer": "Using parallel rendering on the shared login nodes will result in the termination of your session."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first module required to be loaded before loading QGIS?",
    "answer": "You will first need to load gcc, for example, `module load gcc/5.4.0`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view a list of all available QGIS module versions?",
    "answer": "You can see a list of all available QGIS versions using the command `module spider qgis`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load a specific QGIS module version?",
    "answer": "You can load a particular QGIS module using a command like `module load qgis/2.18.24`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What other modules might be necessary depending on QGIS package requirements?",
    "answer": "Depending on the packages you need to install, you might have to load various other modules. For example, 'rgdal' requires 'gdal', which itself requires 'nixpkgs' and 'gcc'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check if nixpkgs is loaded?",
    "answer": "You can ensure that nixpkgs is loaded by running the command `module list`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the nixpkgs module if it's not already loaded?",
    "answer": "If nixpkgs is not listed, you can load it by running `module load nixpkgs/16.09`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if a QGIS package fails to install?",
    "answer": "If any package fails to install, read the error message carefully, as it might provide details about additional modules needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you determine if a module has dependencies on other modules?",
    "answer": "You can find out if a module is dependent on any other module by running `module spider gdal/2.2.1` (using gdal/2.2.1 as an example)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can QGIS be executed from the command line?",
    "answer": "You can execute QGIS by running a Python script, for example, `python qgis_code.py`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `QgsApplication.setPrefixPath()` function in a Python QGIS script?",
    "answer": "It is used to supply the path to the QGIS installation location, for example, `QgsApplication.setPrefixPath(\"/path/to/qgis/installation\", True)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the QGIS GUI be disabled when creating a QgsApplication reference in a Python script?",
    "answer": "Set the second argument to `False` when creating the `QgsApplication` reference: `qgs = QgsApplication([], False)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What function should be called at the end of a QGIS Python script to clean up resources?",
    "answer": "When your script is complete, call `qgs.exitQgis()` to remove the provider and layer registries from memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to submit a QGIS job using a submission script?",
    "answer": "You submit the job with the command `sbatch job.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are interactive nodes recommended for visualizing large datasets with the QGIS GUI?",
    "answer": "Interactive nodes should be used for visualization because runtime is limited on login nodes and parallel rendering on login nodes can lead to session termination. Interactive nodes also provide access to more cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a prerequisite for using the QGIS GUI?",
    "answer": "Using the QGIS GUI requires X11 forwarding, which you should make sure is enabled."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure X11 forwarding is enabled when connecting via MobaXTerm?",
    "answer": "You need to make sure that the X server logo is green, which indicates X11 forwarding is enabled."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to start QGIS in the terminal after loading modules?",
    "answer": "Start QGIS by typing `qgis` in the terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you close QGIS when using the GUI?",
    "answer": "To close QGIS, simply close the window like you usually would."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of requesting a testing job on an interactive node for QGIS GUI?",
    "answer": "Requesting a testing job provides more time for exploring and visualizing data, and gives access to the 40 cores of each of the requested nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request an interactive job with X11 forwarding enabled?",
    "answer": "Request an interactive job using a command like `salloc --time=1:0:0 --ntasks=2 --x11 --account=def-someuser`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `--x11` argument in the `salloc` command?",
    "answer": "The `--x11` argument enables X11 forwarding on the interactive node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can parallel rendering of layers be enabled in QGIS?",
    "answer": "You can enable parallel rendering by clicking 'Settings' and 'Options', then 'Rendering' in the Options window. Check 'Render layers in parallel using many CPU cores' and optionally select a number of cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you terminate an interactive job allocation after finishing with QGIS?",
    "answer": "Once you are done and have closed QGIS, you can terminate the allocation by typing `exit`."
