    "question": "How do you conveniently install an SSH key on a specific system, such as Fir, using the command line?",
    "answer": "On OpenSSH systems, the `ssh-copy-id` command is used. For example: `ssh-copy-id -i alliance-key username@fir.alliancecan.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the `authorized_keys` mechanism considered somewhat fragile?",
    "answer": "SSH is very particular about the permissions on the `authorized_keys` file, your `/home` directory, and the `.ssh` subdirectory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary benefit of using an SSH key agent?",
    "answer": "An SSH key agent supplies the private key for new connections after you enter the passphrase once at startup, avoiding the need to re-enter it every time and preventing the unencrypted private key from being stored on permanent storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should the operation of generating an SSH key pair be performed?",
    "answer": "This operation should be performed on your own computer, not on a shared computer like a cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you specify a comment for an SSH key during generation using `ssh-keygen`?",
    "answer": "You can use the `-C` option, for example: `ssh-keygen -C 'Alliance systems'`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you choose a specific filename for your SSH key pair during generation?",
    "answer": "Use the `-f` option with `ssh-keygen`, for example: `ssh-keygen -f alliance-key`. This creates `alliance-key` for the private part and `alliance-key.pub` for the public part."
  },
  {
    "question": "If you use a custom filename for your SSH key, how do you specify it when logging in?",
    "answer": "You must use the `-i` option with the `ssh` command, like this: `ssh -i alliance-key user@host`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you choose a different key type, such as `ed25519`, when generating an SSH key?",
    "answer": "Use the `-t` option with `ssh-keygen`, for example: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you strengthen an RSA key type by setting a longer key length during generation?",
    "answer": "You can use the `-t rsa-sha2-512` and `-b` options together, for example: `ssh-keygen -t rsa-sha2-512 -b 4096`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default capability of a public key installed without any constraints?",
    "answer": "By default, a public key installed without constraints can do anything."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an SSH public key be constrained to perform only a specific command, like `squeue --me`?",
    "answer": "You can add `restrict,command=\"squeue --me\"` to the public key syntax."
  },
  {
    "question": "What key constraint allows an SSH key to be used only for SFTP?",
    "answer": "The constraint `restrict,command=\"/usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server\"` allows a key to be used only for SFTP."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an SSH key be constrained to only accept connections from specific hosts?",
    "answer": "You can add `restrict,from=\"hostname_or_IP\"` to the public key syntax, for instance: `restrict,from=\"d24-141-114-17.home.cgocable.net\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the effect of the `restrict` keyword on an interactive SSH session if `pty allocation` is not explicitly allowed?",
    "answer": "The `restrict` keyword turns off `pty allocation`, which makes an interactive session behave peculiarly."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can `pty allocation` be enabled for a source-constrained interactive session using key constraints?",
    "answer": "You can add `,pty` to the `restrict,from` constraint, for example: `restrict,from=\"d24-141-114-17.home.cgocable.net\",pty`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find detailed documentation on SSH key constraints?",
    "answer": "Detailed documentation on SSH key constraints is available in the `sshd man` page, accessible by running `man sshd` on a Linux system."
