    "question": "What is the description of the mpb-mpi software?",
    "answer": "MPB-mpi is a software package to compute definite-frequency eigenstates of Maxwell's equations in periodic dielectric structures. It can compute optical dispersion relations and eigenstates for structures such as strip waveguides and optical fibers. MPB-mpi is well suited for the study of photonic crystals: periodic dielectric structures exhibiting a band gap in their optical modes, prohibiting propagation of light in that frequency range."
