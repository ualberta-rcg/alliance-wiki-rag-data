    "question": "What two parameters are identified as important for GPU performance when adapting PyTorch code?",
    "answer": "The two important parameters are `batch_size` and `num_workers`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the `batch_size` parameter improve GPU performance?",
    "answer": "The `batch_size` parameter improves performance by increasing the size of inputs at each iteration, which better utilizes the GPU's capacity."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the `num_workers` parameter improve GPU performance?",
    "answer": "The `num_workers` parameter improves performance by facilitating the movement of data between the host (CPU) memory and the GPU memory, reducing GPU inactivity while waiting for data to process."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main conclusions for optimizing GPU performance with PyTorch?",
    "answer": "The two main conclusions are: 1) Increase the `batch_size` value to the maximum possible for the GPU's memory to optimize performance. 2) Use a `DataLoader` with as many workers as `cpus-per-task` to efficiently supply data to the GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find information on maximizing GPU utilization with small data inputs and small batch sizes?",
    "answer": "Information on maximizing GPU utilization with small data inputs and small batch sizes can be found in the 'Travailler avec un seul GPU' section."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the name of the shell script provided as an example for running PyTorch on a single GPU?",
    "answer": "The shell script is named `pytorch-single-gpu.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Python script used for the single GPU performance test?",
    "answer": "The Python script is `cifar10-gpu.py`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the neural network model (`net`) moved to the GPU in the `cifar10-gpu.py` script?",
    "answer": "The neural network model is moved to the GPU using the line `net = net.cuda()`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the loss function (`criterion`) moved to the GPU in the `cifar10-gpu.py` script?",
    "answer": "The loss function is moved to the GPU using the line `criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss().cuda()`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the input data and targets moved to the GPU during each batch iteration in `cifar10-gpu.py`?",
    "answer": "Input data and targets are moved to the GPU using `inputs = inputs.cuda()` and `targets = targets.cuda()` within the training loop."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to install `torch` and `torchvision` in the `pytorch-single-gpu.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The command `pip install torch torchvision --no-index` is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default `batch_size` argument passed to `cifar10-gpu.py` in the example `pytorch-single-gpu.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The default `batch_size` is `512`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default `num_workers` argument passed to `cifar10-gpu.py` in the example `pytorch-single-gpu.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The default `num_workers` is `0`."
