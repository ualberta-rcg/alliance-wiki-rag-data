  {
    "question": "What is the primary focus of the genewise package?",
    "answer": "The genewise package is focused on comparisons of biopolymers, particularly DNA sequence and protein sequence, and is known for comparing DNA sequences at the level of protein translation to predict gene structure with homology-based alignment."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of GenMap?",
    "answer": "GenMap computes the uniqueness of k-mers for each position in a genome, allowing for up to 'e' mismatches, and can be applied to single or multiple genomes to identify unique or shared regions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a low mappability value in GenMap indicate?",
    "answer": "A low mappability value in GenMap indicates that the k-mer at that position belongs to a repetitive region."
