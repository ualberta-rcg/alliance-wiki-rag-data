  {
    "question": "How do multiple processes write data contiguously to a single file using MPI-IO?",
    "answer": "Each process writes its data into a designated portion in the same file, with writing proceeding in a contiguous fashion from process 0 to 3."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the C MPI-IO example, how is the array `a` initialized for each process?",
    "answer": "For each process, the array `a` is initialized such that `a[i] = (char)('0' + rank)` for `i` from 0 to 9. For example, processor 3 creates an array `a[0:9]` filled with '3' characters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What MPI-IO function is used to open a file for writing in the C example for contiguous data, and what modes are typically combined?",
    "answer": "`MPI_File_open` is used. In the example, `MPI_MODE_CREATE|MPI_MODE_WRONLY` are combined, meaning the file is created if it doesn't exist and opened for write-only access."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the `displace` offset calculated for each process in the C MPI-IO contiguous data example?",
    "answer": "The `displace` offset is calculated by `rank * n * sizeof(char)`, where `rank` is the process ID and `n` is the array size (e.g., 10)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of `MPI_File_set_view` in the C MPI-IO example for contiguous data writing?",
    "answer": "`MPI_File_set_view` is used to assign specific writing regions to each process. The `displacement` is set, and `etype` and `filetype` are both set to `MPI_CHAR`, with 'native' indicating that data is stored in the file exactly as it is in memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is MPI-IO a part of a standard library?",
    "answer": "Yes, MPI-IO is a part of the standard MPI-2 library."
  },
  {
    "question": "How widely available is MPI-IO on HPC systems?",
    "answer": "MPI-IO is very widely installed on almost all HPC systems with modern MPI versions. For example, OpenMPI, which supports MPI-IO, is installed on all described clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does MPI-IO require additional library installations?",
    "answer": "No, MPI-IO does not require additional library installations beyond the standard MPI library."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations of MPI-IO regarding data portability and description?",
    "answer": "MPI-IO writes raw data to files, which means it is not portable across platforms, it is hard to append new variables, and it does not include data description."
