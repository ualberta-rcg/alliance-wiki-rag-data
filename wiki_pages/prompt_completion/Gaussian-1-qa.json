  },
  {
    "question": "What should be prepared for a Gaussian job submission?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to run a G16 job from a job script?",
    "answer": "The command is `G16 name.com`, where `name.com` is the input file and `name.log` will be the output."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you use Gaussian 09 or Gaussian 03 instead of G16 in a job script?",
    "answer": "You modify the `module load` command to `gaussian/g09.e01` or `gaussian/g03.d01` and change the execution command from `G16` to `G09` or `G03` respectively."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are default runtime files saved when using the g16 (lowercase) option?",
    "answer": "The default runtime files are saved temporarily in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` (e.g., `/localscratch/username.jobid.0/`) on the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the runtime files saved with the g16 (lowercase) option after a job is done?",

  },
  {
    "question": "When should you use the g16 (lowercase) option for Gaussian jobs?",
    "answer": "You should use this option if you do not expect to use the .rwf file to restart in a later time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the size of `/localscratch` and who shares it?",
    "answer": "`/localscratch` is approximately 800GB and is shared by all jobs running on the same node."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should you use the G16 (capitalized) option instead of g16 (lowercase) for runtime files?",
