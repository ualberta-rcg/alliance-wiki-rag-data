    "question": "How do you prepare the environment before launching COMSOL in graphical mode on cluster nodes?",
    "answer": "Open a terminal in vncviewer and run `export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=${SLURM_TMPDIR}`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to launch COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 (or a more recent version) graphically on cluster nodes?",
    "answer": "After exporting XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, load the modules with `module load StdEnv/2023` and `module load comsol/6.3`, then execute `comsol`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6 (or a more recent version than 5.5 in that context) graphically on cluster nodes?",
    "answer": "After exporting XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, load the modules with `module load StdEnv/2020` and `module load comsol/5.6`, then execute `comsol`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to launch COMSOL Multiphysics 5.5 (or an older version) graphically on cluster nodes?",
    "answer": "After exporting XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, load the modules with `module load StdEnv/2016` and `module load comsol/5.5`, then execute `comsol`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are valid interactive graphical uses for gra-vdi nodes with COMSOL?",
    "answer": "Valid uses include launching test tasks (with a maximum of 8 cores and 128GB of memory), creating or modifying input files for a simulation, post-processing, or visualizing data."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should COMSOL be used on a cluster node instead of a gra-vdi node for graphical work?",
    "answer": "If you need more cores or memory than what is available on a gra-vdi node (maximum 8 cores and 128GB)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to gra-vdi to use COMSOL graphically?",
    "answer": "Connect to gra-vdi using TigerVNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are needed to launch COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 (or a more recent version) graphically on gra-vdi nodes?",
    "answer": "Open a terminal in vncviewer, then run `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023`, `module avail comsol`, `module load comsol/6.3`, and finally `comsol -np 12 -Dosgi.locking=none`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6 (or a version compatible with StdEnv/2020) graphically on gra-vdi nodes?",
    "answer": "Open a terminal in vncviewer, then run `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2020`, `module avail comsol`, `module load comsol/5.6`, and finally `comsol -np 12 -Dosgi.locking=none`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the procedure to launch COMSOL Multiphysics 5.5 (or an older version) graphically on gra-vdi nodes?",
    "answer": "Open a terminal in vncviewer, then run `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2016`, `module avail comsol`, `module load comsol/5.5`, and finally `comsol -np 12 -Dosgi.locking=none`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if the top menu options in COMSOL are disabled when it starts in graphical mode?",
    "answer": "Your `~/.comsol` directory might be corrupted. To fix this, rename or delete the entire directory using `rm -rf ~/.comsol` and then restart COMSOL."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can parameter problems be resolved in COMSOL's interactive graphical interface?",
    "answer": "Parameter problems can be solved using the 'Batch Sweep' approach."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to achieve acceleration by parallelizing tasks for batch sweeps in COMSOL?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to obtain acceleration by parallelizing tasks during batch sweeps."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a cluster sweep performed for COMSOL simulations?",
    "answer": "A cluster sweep requires submitting a task via the command line to the scheduler using `sbatch slurmscript`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the functionality to submit parametric simulations to a cluster queue from COMSOL's graphical interface using the 'Cluster Sweep' node currently available?",
    "answer": "No, the functionality to submit parametric simulations to a cluster queue from COMSOL's graphical interface with the 'Cluster Sweep' node is not currently offered."
