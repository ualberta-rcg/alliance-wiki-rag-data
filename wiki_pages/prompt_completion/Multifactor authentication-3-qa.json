  },
  {
    "question": "What is the process for logging into the account portal with multifactor authentication enabled?",
    "answer": "After entering your username and password, you will see a prompt to select your desired second factor option to complete authentication."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do command line SSH clients require special configuration for multifactor authentication?",
    "answer": "No, command line SSH clients typically support multifactor authentication without additional configuration."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do graphical SSH clients usually require special configuration for multifactor authentication?",
    "answer": "Yes, graphical SSH clients often require specific instructions and configuration to work with multifactor authentication."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does FileZilla repeatedly ask for the password and second factor during file transfers?",
    "answer": "FileZilla asks for the password and second factor each time a transfer is initiated because, by default, transfers use independent connections that are automatically closed after some idle time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I reduce the number of times I have to enter my password and second factor in FileZilla?",
    "answer": "To avoid multiple prompts in FileZilla, limit the number of simultaneous connections to each site to '1' in 'Site Manager' => 'Transfer Settings tab,' although this will prevent browsing the server during transfers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to configure a new site in FileZilla for SFTP with interactive logon?",
    "answer": "Launch FileZilla, select 'Site Manager,' create or edit a site. On the 'General' tab, set Protocol to 'SFTP \u2013 SSH File Transfer Protocol,' Host to [the cluster login hostname], Logon Type to 'Interactive,' and User to [your username]. On the 'Transfer Settings' tab, check 'Limit number of simultaneous connections' and set 'Maximum number of connections' to 1, then click 'OK' and test the connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a workaround for using FileZilla with Niagara, given its SSH key and MFA prompt requirements?",
    "answer": "First, attempt to connect with an SSH key (which will fail due to the interactive MFA prompt, but FileZilla will remember the key). Then, change the login method to 'interactive' and attempt to connect again to receive the 2FA prompt."

  {
    "question": "Which version of MobaXTerm is recommended for multifactor authentication?",
    "answer": "MobaXTerm version 23.1 or later is recommended, with version 23.5 being the latest for which the provided instructions work for most users."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does MobaXterm prompt for the second factor during file transfers by default?",
    "answer": "MobaXterm establishes two connections by default (one for the terminal and one for the remote file browser), and the file browser's default SFTP protocol causes a mandatory second prompt for authentication."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can MobaXterm's file transfer prompt behavior be improved?",
    "answer": "The behavior can be improved by switching the 'SSH-browser type' to 'SCP (enhanced speed)' or 'SCP (normal speed)' in the session's 'Advanced SSH settings.'"
  },
  {
    "question": "What changes should be made to MobaXterm's SSH settings to enable downloads and use an SSH key instead of a password?",
    "answer": "In MobaXterm's SSH settings (SSH tab in Settings dialogue), uncheck 'GSSAPI Kerberos' and 'Use external Pageant,' check 'Use internal SSH agent \"MobAgent\",' and use the '+' button to select your SSH key file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the known issues when using MobaXterm with multifactor authentication?",
    "answer": "MobaXterm can exhibit strange behavior, such as file operations (open, download, or upload) hanging indefinitely when using the left navigation bar, potentially due to hidden MFA-Duo windows or new MFA transactions starting each time you navigate to a different folder."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many independent authentication sessions are typically involved when using MobaXterm with MFA?",
    "answer": "There are typically three independent sessions requiring authentication: one to open the SSH terminal, one to display the contents of the folder on the left pane, and one to start the transfer of files."
