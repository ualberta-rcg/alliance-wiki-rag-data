    "question": "What is the procedure to mount CephFS in a user's home directory using ceph-fuse?",
    "answer": "First, create a mount point directory, for example, `mkdir ~/my_cephfs`. Then, use the command `ceph-fuse my_cephfs/ --id=MyCephFS-RW --conf=~/ceph.conf --keyring=~/ceph.keyring --client-mountpoint=/volumes/_nogroup/f6cb8f06-f0a4-4b88-b261-f8bd6b03582c`."
