  {
    "question": "What is computational chemistry?",
    "answer": "Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that incorporates the results of theoretical chemistry into computer programs to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors influence the grouping of computational chemistry methods?",
    "answer": "Most computer programs in computational chemistry offer a large number of methods that are broadly grouped in terms of the trade-off between accuracy, applicability, and cost."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics of 'ab initio' methods?",
    "answer": "'Ab initio' methods are based entirely on first principles, are broadly applicable but very costly in terms of CPU time, and are mostly applied to systems with a small number of particles."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do semi-empirical methods compare to 'ab initio' methods?",
    "answer": "Semi-empirical methods give accurate results for a narrower range of cases, but are typically much faster than 'ab initio' methods."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why have density functional methods become widely used?",
    "answer": "Density functional methods offer a very good cost-accuracy trade-off, serving as a compromise between 'ab initio' and semi-empirical methods, and have therefore become very widely used in recent years."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are molecular mechanics methods based on?",
    "answer": "Molecular mechanics methods are based on classical mechanics instead of quantum mechanics."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do molecular mechanics methods reproduce material properties?",
    "answer": "They use a force field that can be optimized using 'ab initio' and/or experimental data to reproduce the properties of the materials."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what size systems are molecular mechanics methods frequently used?",
    "answer": "Due to their low cost, molecular mechanics methods can be applied to systems of thousands or even millions of particles."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are molecular dynamics calculations useful for?",
    "answer": "Molecular dynamics calculations are extremely useful in the study of biological systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Name some types of materials that can be simulated using molecular dynamics calculations.",
    "answer": "Molecular dynamics calculations can be used to simulate glasses, metals, liquids, supercooled liquids, granular materials, and complex materials."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which computational chemistry software package includes NBO?",
    "answer": "NBO is included in several Gaussian modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find a list of all software versions installed on Compute Canada systems?",
    "answer": "An automatically generated list of all the versions installed on Compute Canada systems can be found on the 'Available software' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Molden used for?",
    "answer": "Molden is a visualization tool for use in conjunction with GAMESS, Gaussian, and other applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe VMD.",
    "answer": "VMD is an open-source molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems in 3D."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is VisIt?",
    "answer": "VisIt is a general-purpose 3D visualization tool, with a gallery presenting examples from chemistry."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is CheMPS2?",
    "answer": "CheMPS2 is a library containing a spin-adapted implementation of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) for 'ab initio' quantum chemistry."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Libxc used for?",
    "answer": "Libxc is a library used in density-functional models."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Open3DQSAR designed for?",
    "answer": "Open3DQSAR is a tool aimed at pharmacophore exploration by high-throughput chemometric analysis of molecular interaction fields."
  },
  {
    "question": "What functionalities does Open Babel provide?",
    "answer": "Open Babel provides a set of tools to search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling, chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is PCMSolver?",
    "answer": "PCMSolver is a tool for code development related to the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM)."
  },
