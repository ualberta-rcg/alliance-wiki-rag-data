  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of METIS software?",
    "answer": "METIS is a set of serial programs used for partitioning graphs, partitioning finite element meshes, and generating fill-reducing orderings for sparse matrices. Its algorithms are based on multilevel recursive-bisection, multilevel k-way, and multi-constraint partitioning schemes."

    "question": "What is Minimac3 used for?",
    "answer": "Minimac3 is a computationally efficient implementation of genotype imputation algorithms designed to handle very large reference panels with no loss of accuracy, improving upon minimac and minimac2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of Minimac3 is available?",
    "answer": "Minimac3 is available in version 2.0.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is minimap2 and what are its key features?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 is a fast sequence mapping and alignment program capable of finding overlaps between long noisy reads or mapping long reads/assemblies to a reference genome. It works efficiently with query sequences from a few kilobases to ~100 megabases at an error rate of ~15% and outputs in PAF or SAM format. It is also noted as being over 20 times faster than most other long-read aligners and replaces BWA-MEM for long reads and contig alignment."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of minimap2 is mentioned?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 is mentioned in version 2.17."
  },
  {
    "question": "What functionalities does MiXCR provide?",
    "answer": "MiXCR is a universal framework for processing big immunome data from raw sequences to quantitated clonotypes. It efficiently handles paired- and single-end reads, considers sequence quality, corrects PCR errors, identifies germline hypermutations, and supports both partial- and full-length profiling using all available RNA or DNA information."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the available version of mixcr?",
    "answer": "The available version of mixcr is 4.1.2."
