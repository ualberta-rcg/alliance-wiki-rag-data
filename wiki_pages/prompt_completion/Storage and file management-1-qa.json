    "question": "What kind of storage options are provided to users?",
    "answer": "A wide range of storage options, from high-speed temporary local storage to different kinds of long-term storage, are provided to cover diverse user needs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should filesystems be used responsibly?",
    "answer": "Filesystems on our systems are a shared resource, and unwise behavior can negatively affect dozens or hundreds of other users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of files are the filesystems designed to store?",
    "answer": "These filesystems are designed to store a limited number of very large files, typically binary ones, since very large text files lose most of their interest in being readable by humans."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of files should users avoid storing?",
    "answer": "Users should avoid storing tens of thousands of small files (less than a few megabytes), particularly in the same directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended approach for managing many small files?",
    "answer": "A better approach is to use commands like `tar` or `zip` to convert a directory containing many small files into a single very large archive file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the user's responsibility regarding stored data?",
    "answer": "It is the user's responsibility to manage the age of their stored data. Most filesystems are not intended to provide indefinite archiving, so unneeded files should be moved to a more appropriate filesystem, such as a personal workstation or other storage system under their control."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tool should be used for moving significant amounts of data?",
    "answer": "Moving significant amounts of data between your workstation and one of our systems or between two of our systems should generally be done using Globus."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the storage systems?",
    "answer": "Our storage systems are not for personal use and should only be used to store research data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What will a new account's home directory contain upon creation?",
    "answer": "When an account is created on a cluster, the home directory will contain symbolic links to the user's scratch and project spaces, which serve as shortcuts for easy access."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long might it take for symbolic links to appear in a new home directory?",
    "answer": "These symbolic links may appear up to a few hours after you first connect to the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which storage spaces are unique to an individual user, and which are shared?",
    "answer": "Home and scratch spaces are unique to an individual user, while the project space is shared by a research group."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a research group for project space typically defined?",
    "answer": "A research group may consist of individuals with an account sponsored by a particular faculty member or members of a Resource Allocation Competition (RAC) allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a user have access to multiple project spaces?",
    "answer": "Yes, an individual may have access to several different project spaces, associated with one or more faculty members, with symbolic links to these different project spaces in the 'projects' directory of their home."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can a user find links to the projects they have access to?",
    "answer": "In the folder `projects` within their home directory, each user has a link to each of the projects they have access to."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the default project determined for users with multiple sponsored roles?",
    "answer": "Users with more than one active sponsored role will have a default project that corresponds to the default project of the faculty member with the most sponsored accounts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What utility can users use to check disk space and utilization for project, home, and scratch filesystems?",
    "answer": "All users can check the available disk space and the current disk utilization for the project, home, and scratch filesystems with the command-line utility `diskusage_report`, available on our clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you use the `diskusage_report` utility?",
    "answer": "To use the `diskusage_report` utility, log into the cluster using SSH, type `diskusage_report` at the command prompt, and press the Enter key."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more detailed disk usage output than what `diskusage_report` provides?",
    "answer": "More detailed output is available using the Diskusage Explorer tool."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do these systems differ from a personal computer in terms of storage?",
    "answer": "Unlike a personal computer, our systems typically have several storage spaces or filesystems, and users should ensure they are using the right space for the right task."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics and recommended uses for the HOME directory?",
    "answer": "The HOME directory generally has a relatively small quota and doesn't have especially good performance for writing and reading large amounts of data. Its most logical use is typically for source code, small parameter files, and job submission scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics and recommended uses for PROJECT space?",
    "answer": "PROJECT space has a significantly larger quota and is well adapted to sharing data among members of a research group, as it is linked to a professor's account. Data stored in project space should be fairly static to avoid burdening the tape-based backup system."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should SCRATCH space be used?",
    "answer": "SCRATCH space is the best choice for intensive read/write operations on large files (> 100 MB per file). It should be used for temporary files like checkpoint files, output from jobs, and other data that can easily be recreated, as it is not backed up and older files are subject to purging."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a critical warning about using SCRATCH space?",
    "answer": "Users should not regard SCRATCH as their normal storage; it is for transient files that they can afford to lose because important files are not backed up there and older files are subject to purging."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is NEARLINE storage designed for?",
    "answer": "NEARLINE is a tape-based filesystem intended for inactive data. Datasets which you do not expect to access for months are good candidates to be stored in `/nearline`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is `SLURM_TMPDIR` used for during a job's execution?",
    "answer": "`SLURM_TMPDIR` holds a unique path to a temporary folder on a fast, local filesystem on each compute node allocated to the job, used for temporary files only needed for the duration of the job, as its contents are deleted when the job ends."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main advantage of `SLURM_TMPDIR` compared to other networked filesystems?",
    "answer": "The main advantage of `SLURM_TMPDIR` is increased performance due to the filesystem being local to the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of files is `SLURM_TMPDIR` especially well-suited for?",
    "answer": "`SLURM_TMPDIR` is especially well-suited for large collections of small files (for example, smaller than a few megabytes per file)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the `SLURM_TMPDIR` filesystem exclusive to a single job?",
    "answer": "No, the `SLURM_TMPDIR` filesystem is shared between all jobs running on the node."
