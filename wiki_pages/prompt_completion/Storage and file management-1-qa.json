    "question": "What types of storage solutions are offered to users?",
    "answer": "A wide range of storage options are offered, from high-speed temporary local storage to different kinds of long-term storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should filesystems on the systems be used?",
    "answer": "Filesystems are a shared resource and should be used responsibly, as unwise behavior can negatively affect other users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary design purpose of these filesystems regarding file size and type?",
    "answer": "These filesystems are designed to store a limited number of very large files, which are typically binary."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should users store many small files, especially in the same directory?",
    "answer": "No, users should avoid storing tens of thousands of small files (less than a few megabytes), particularly in the same directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended method for handling directories containing many small files?",
    "answer": "A better approach is to use commands like `tar` or `zip` to convert a directory containing many small files into a single very large archive file."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the filesystems intended for indefinite data archiving?",
    "answer": "No, most of the filesystems are not intended to provide an indefinite archiving service, and users are responsible for managing the age of their stored data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What action should be taken when a file or directory is no longer needed on the system?",
    "answer": "When a file or directory is no longer needed, it should be moved to a more appropriate filesystem, such as a personal workstation or another storage system under the user's control."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should significant amounts of data be moved between systems or a workstation and a system?",
    "answer": "Moving significant amounts of data should generally be done using Globus."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the intended use of the provided storage systems?",
    "answer": "The storage systems are not for personal use and should only be used to store research data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What content will a user's home directory have when an account is first created on a cluster?",
    "answer": "Upon account creation, a user's home directory will contain symbolic links that reference their scratch and project spaces."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long might it take for the symbolic links to scratch and project spaces to appear?",
    "answer": "These symbolic links may appear up to a few hours after a user first connects to the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who has access to home, scratch, and project spaces?",
    "answer": "Home and scratch spaces are unique to individual users, while the project space is shared by a research group."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are research groups typically formed for sharing project space?",
    "answer": "Research groups typically consist of individuals with an account sponsored by a faculty member or members of an RAC allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a single user access multiple project spaces?",
    "answer": "Yes, an individual may have access to several different project spaces, associated with one or more faculty members."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are links to different project spaces located in a user's home directory?",
    "answer": "Symbolic links to different project spaces are located in the `projects` directory within a user's home directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a user's default project determined if they have only one active sponsored role?",
    "answer": "For users with a single active sponsored role, their default project is that of their sponsor."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a user's default project determined if they have multiple active sponsored roles?",
    "answer": "For users with more than one active sponsored role, the default project corresponds to the default project of the faculty member with the most sponsored accounts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command-line utility can be used to check disk usage for project, home, and scratch filesystems?",
    "answer": "All users can check disk space and utilization for the project, home, and scratch filesystems using the command line utility `diskusage_report`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do users execute the `diskusage_report` utility?",
    "answer": "To use `diskusage_report`, users should log into the cluster using SSH, type `diskusage_report` at the command prompt, and press Enter."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more detailed disk usage output?",
    "answer": "More detailed output is available using the Diskusage Explorer tool."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to select the correct storage space for a given task on these systems?",
    "answer": "It is important to use the right space for the right task because the systems typically have several storage spaces or filesystems, each with different characteristics and intended uses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the general characteristics of the HOME directory regarding quota and performance?",
    "answer": "The home directory generally has a relatively small quota and does not offer particularly good performance for writing and reading large amounts of data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended use for a user's home directory?",
    "answer": "The most logical uses for a home directory are typically source code, small parameter files, and job submission scripts."
