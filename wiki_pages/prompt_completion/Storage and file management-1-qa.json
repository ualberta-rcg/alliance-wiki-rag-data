    "question": "What range of storage options is available on the systems?",
    "answer": "The systems provide a wide range of storage options, from high-speed temporary local storage to different kinds of long-term storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should filesystems be used responsibly?",
    "answer": "Filesystems are a shared resource, and unwise behavior can negatively affect dozens or hundreds of other users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of files are the filesystems primarily designed to store?",
    "answer": "These filesystems are designed to store a limited number of very large files, which are typically binary."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should users store many small text files on the system?",
    "answer": "Users should avoid storing tens of thousands of small files (less than a few megabytes), particularly in the same directory, especially if they are text files that lose readability interest when very large."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended method for storing a directory containing many small files?",
    "answer": "A better approach is to use commands like `tar` or `zip` to convert a directory containing many small files into a single very large archive file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the user's responsibility regarding the age of stored data?",
    "answer": "It is the user's responsibility to manage the age of stored data, as most filesystems are not intended to provide an indefinite archiving service, so unneeded files should be moved."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should significant amounts of data be moved between a workstation and the systems, or between two systems?",
    "answer": "Moving significant amounts of data should generally be done using Globus."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the storage systems?",
    "answer": "Our storage systems are not for personal use and should only be used to store research data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a home directory contain upon account creation?",
    "answer": "When an account is created, the home directory will contain symbolic links to the user's scratch and project spaces."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long might it take for symbolic links to scratch and project spaces to appear?",
    "answer": "These symbolic links may appear up to a few hours after you first connect to the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who shares the project space?",
    "answer": "The project space is shared by a research group, which can consist of individuals with an account sponsored by a faculty member or members of an RAC allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can an individual user access multiple project spaces?",
    "answer": "Yes, a given individual may have access to several different project spaces, with symbolic links to these spaces located in the `projects` directory of their home."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command-line utility is available to check disk space and utilization?",
    "answer": "All users can check the available disk space and current disk utilization for the project, home, and scratch filesystems with the command line utility `diskusage_report`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run the `diskusage_report` utility?",
    "answer": "To use `diskusage_report`, log into the cluster using SSH, type `diskusage_report` at the command prompt, and press Enter."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more detailed disk usage information?",
    "answer": "More detailed output is available using the Diskusage Explorer tool."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary intended use for the HOME directory?",
    "answer": "The most logical use of your home directory is typically source code, small parameter files, and job submission scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the home directory not suitable for all files and work?",
    "answer": "Your home normally has a relatively small quota and doesn't have especially good performance for writing and reading large amounts of data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics and intended use of the PROJECT storage space?",
    "answer": "The project space has a significantly larger quota, is well adapted to sharing data among research group members (linked to a professor's account), and should store fairly static data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the intended use for SCRATCH storage?",
    "answer": "SCRATCH is the best choice for intensive read/write operations on large files (> 100 MB per file) and should be used for temporary files like checkpoint files and job output that can easily be recreated, as it is not backed up and is subject to purging."
