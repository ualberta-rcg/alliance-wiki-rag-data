  },
  {
    "question": "What is Filtlong?",
    "answer": "Filtlong is a bioinformatics tool used for filtering long sequencing reads by quality, producing a smaller, higher-quality subset of reads."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Filtlong filter long reads?",
    "answer": "Filtlong filters long reads by considering both read length (prioritizing longer reads) and read identity (prioritizing higher quality reads) to select a better subset."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of Filtlong are available?",
    "answer": "Filtlong is available in versions 0.2.0 and 0.2.1."

  {
    "question": "What is FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads)?",
    "answer": "FLASH is a fast and accurate software tool designed to merge paired-end reads from next-generation sequencing experiments, particularly when DNA fragments are shorter than twice the read length."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can FLASH improve sequencing assemblies?",
    "answer": "By merging paired-end reads, FLASH produces longer reads that can significantly improve both genome and transcriptome assemblies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is flashpca?",
    "answer": "flashpca is described as a tool for filtering long reads by quality, capable of producing a smaller, better subset by considering read length and identity."
