    "question": "What is Octopus (chem)?",
    "answer": "Octopus is a scientific program aimed at the ab initio virtual experimentation on a hopefully ever-increasing range of system types. Electrons are described quantum-mechanically within density-functional theory (DFT), in its time-dependent form (TDDFT) when doing simulations in time. Nuclei are described classically as point particles. Electron-nucleus interaction is described within the pseudopotential approximation."

    "question": "What is Octopus-bio?",
    "answer": "Octopus is a mapping-based variant caller that implements several calling models within a unified haplotype-aware framework. Octopus takes inspiration from particle filtering by constructing a tree of haplotypes and dynamically pruning and extending the tree based on haplotype posterior probabilities in a sequential manner. This allows octopus to implicitly consider all possible haplotypes at a given loci in reasonable time."
