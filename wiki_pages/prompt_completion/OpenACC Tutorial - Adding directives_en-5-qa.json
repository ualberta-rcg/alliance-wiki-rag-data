    "question": "What is the primary responsibility when using the OpenACC `parallel loop` directive?",
    "answer": "It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that parallelism is safe when using the `parallel loop` directive."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary responsibility when using the OpenACC `kernels` directive?",
    "answer": "It is the compiler's responsibility to analyze the code and determine what is safe to parallelize when using the `kernels` directive."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which OpenACC directive allows the compiler more room for optimization?",
    "answer": "The `kernels` directive allows the compiler more room to optimize."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which OpenACC directive is useful for parallelizing code sections that the compiler might miss?",
    "answer": "The `parallel loop` directive enables parallelization of sections that the compiler may miss."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do OpenACC `parallel loop` and `kernels` directives compare in terms of validity and performance?",
    "answer": "Both `parallel loop` and `kernels` approaches are equally valid and can perform equally well."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which OpenACC directive offers a straightforward path for programmers familiar with OpenMP?",
    "answer": "The `parallel loop` directive offers a straightforward path from OpenMP."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an advantage of the OpenACC `kernels` directive regarding code coverage?",
    "answer": "A single `kernels` directive can cover a large area of code."
  },
  {
    "question": "What functions are suggested for modification in the OpenACC challenge?",
    "answer": "The challenge suggests modifying the `matvec`, `waxpby`, and `dot` functions to use OpenACC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What OpenACC directives can be used for the challenge?",
    "answer": "For the challenge, either the `kernels` or the `parallel loop` directives can be used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What compiler flags need to be added to the Makefile for the OpenACC challenge?",
    "answer": "The Makefile should be modified to add `-acc -gpu=managed` and `-Minfo=accel` to the compiler flags."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find solutions for the OpenACC challenge?",
    "answer": "Solutions for the OpenACC challenge are available in the `step1.*` directories of the [https://github.com/calculquebec/cq-formation-openacc Github repository]."
