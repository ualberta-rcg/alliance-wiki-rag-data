    "question": "Where is the $SLURM_TMPDIR environment variable set on Niagara?",
    "answer": "The $SLURM_TMPDIR environment variable is set on Niagara compute jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does $SLURM_TMPDIR point to on Niagara compute nodes?",
    "answer": "On Niagara compute jobs, $SLURM_TMPDIR points to RAMdisk, not to local hard drives."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the contents of the $SLURM_TMPDIR directory after a job finishes?",

  {
    "question": "Do Niagara compute nodes have local disks?",
    "answer": "No, Niagara compute nodes have no local disks."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does $SLURM_TMPDIR on Niagara differ from systems like Cedar and Graham?",
    "answer": "On Niagara, $SLURM_TMPDIR lives in memory (ramdisk), whereas on general purpose Compute Canada systems like Cedar and Graham, it points to a directory on a node-local SSD disk."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is $BB_JOB_DIR?",
    "answer": "For every job on Niagara, the scheduler creates a temporary directory on the burst buffer called $BB_JOB_DIR."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the $BB_JOB_DIR directory accessible from all nodes of a job?",
    "answer": "Yes, the $BB_JOB_DIR directory is accessible from all nodes of a job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of applications is $BB_JOB_DIR intended for?",
    "answer": "$BB_JOB_DIR is intended for applications that generate many small temporary files or create files that are accessed very frequently (high IOPS applications), but that do not fit in ramdisk."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should ramdisk be preferred over burst buffer for temporary files?",
    "answer": "If temporary files fit in ramdisk, it is generally a better location than burst buffer because the bandwidth and IOPS of ramdisk far exceed those of the burst buffer."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users access ramdisk for temporary files?",
    "answer": "Users can directly access /dev/shm or use the environment variable $SLURM_TMPDIR to use ramdisk."

    "answer": "Yes, the $HOME filesystem is backed up."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the $HOME filesystem accessible on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "The $HOME filesystem is read-only on compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the individual user quota for the $SCRATCH filesystem?",
    "answer": "The individual user quota for $SCRATCH is 25 TB, provided the group quota is not reached."

    "answer": "For groups of up to 4 users, the $SCRATCH group quota is 50TB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the quota for the $PROJECT filesystem?",
    "answer": "The quota for the $PROJECT filesystem is determined by group allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the $PROJECT filesystem backed up?",
    "answer": "Yes, the $PROJECT filesystem is backed up."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the backup policy for the $ARCHIVE filesystem?",
    "answer": "The $ARCHIVE filesystem uses a dual-copy backup policy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the $ARCHIVE filesystem accessible on login or compute nodes?",
    "answer": "No, the $ARCHIVE filesystem is not accessible on login nodes or compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the user quota for the $BBUFFER filesystem?",
    "answer": "The quota for the $BBUFFER filesystem is 10 TB per user."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does $BBUFFER stand for?",
    "answer": "$BBUFFER stands for Burst Buffer, which is a faster parallel storage tier for temporary data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'backup' mean in the context of SciNet filesystems?",
    "answer": "Backup means a recent snapshot, not an archive of all data that ever was."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which command provides information on disk usage for home, scratch, project, and archive filesystems?",
    "answer": "The `/scinet/niagara/bin/diskUsage` command provides information on disk usage for the home, scratch, project, and archive filesystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the `diskUsage` command available?",
    "answer": "The `diskUsage` command is available on the login nodes and datamovers."
  },

    "question": "How can a user view the disk usage of all members in their group?",
    "answer": "A user can view the disk usage of all members in their group by using the `diskUsage -a` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user check which of their directories have more than 1000 files?",
    "answer": "A user can check which of their directories have more than 1000 files with the `/scinet/niagara/bin/topUserDirOver1000list` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user identify directories with more than 1GB of material?",
    "answer": "A user can identify directories with more than 1GB of material using the `/scinet/niagara/bin/topUserDirOver1GBlist` command."
