  },
  {
    "question": "After clearing generated data in Ansys Workbench, what are the next steps to properly exit and prepare for job submission?",
    "answer": "Click `File -> Exit` from the top menu, then click `No` when prompted to save modified project, and finally quit Workbench."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I prevent the Workbench solution from being overwritten during repeated test runs on a cluster?",
    "answer": "Remove `;Save(Overwrite=True)` from the last line of your Slurm script, or save a copy of the original `YOURPROJECT.wbpj` and its `YOURPROJECT_files` subdirectory before each test run."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you submit an Ansys Workbench project file to the queue using a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "Customize one of the provided Slurm scripts (e.g., `script-wbpj-202X.sh`) and launch it with the command `sbatch script-wbpj-202X.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which module versions are typically loaded for an Ansys Workbench job using `StdEnv/2023` in a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "Typically, `module load StdEnv/2023 ansys/2023R2` or newer Ansys module versions are loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is memory parallelism (`MEMPAR`) configured in an Ansys Workbench Slurm script for single-node vs. multi-node execution?",
