    "question": "How do I add a read group (RG) tag to a BAM file using GATK?",
    "answer": "To add a read group tag, you can use the `AddOrReplaceReadGroups` command in GATK/PICARD. An example command would be: `gatk AddOrReplaceReadGroups -I input.bam -O output.bam --RGLB tag --RGPL ILLUMINA --RGPU tag --RGSM tag --SORT_ORDER 'coordinate' --CREATE_INDEX true`."

  {
    "question": "What should I do if I encounter a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error when running GATK?",
    "answer": "If you receive a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error, you should add or increase the `-Xmx` command within the `--java-options` argument to reserve more memory for the Java Virtual Machine. For example, use `--java-options \"-Xmx8G DGATK_STACKTRACE_ON_USER_EXCEPTION=true\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What if increasing the heap memory does not resolve a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error in GATK?",
    "answer": "If increasing heap memory doesn't fix the issue, especially with non-model organisms and many scaffolds, it's recommended to remove small scaffolds and create subsets of your reference. This involves mapping multiple times and running pipelines on each subset, though this approach may not work for all pipelines."

    "question": "How can I control GATK/JAVA applications from using more memory or CPUs than requested?",
    "answer": "To control GATK/JAVA applications from using more resources than requested, which is often due to JAVA garbage collection, add `-XX:ConcGCThreads=1` to the `--java-options` argument."
