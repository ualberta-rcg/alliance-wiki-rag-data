    "question": "What Fortran statement immediately follows the `function computeIntegral(...)` declaration?",
    "answer": "The `implicit none` statement follows the function declaration."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the `computeIntegral` function, what are the declared data type and intent for `boundInf` and `boundSup`?",
    "answer": "`boundInf` and `boundSup` are declared as `real` type with `intent(in)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `interface` block within the `computeIntegral` function?",
    "answer": "The `interface` block is used to explicitly define the signature of the `func` argument, which is a function pointer."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the function `func` defined within its `interface` block inside `computeIntegral`?",
    "answer": "Within its `interface` block, `func` is defined as a `real` function that takes a `real, intent(in) :: x` as an argument."
