    "question": "What type of job script is used to split a MrBayes calculation into multiple Slurm jobs for checkpointing?",
    "answer": "A job array script is used for this purpose."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many Slurm jobs will be launched by the provided job array script (`submit-mrbayes-cp.sh`)?",
    "answer": "The script will launch two Slurm jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `sbatch` command is used to submit the MrBayes checkpointing job array script?",
    "answer": "The script is submitted using `sbatch submit-mrbayes-cp.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `--array` parameter in the `submit-mrbayes-cp.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The `--array=1-2%1` parameter is used to define the job array, specifying that there are two sub-jobs and only one should run at a time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the job array script (`submit-mrbayes-cp.sh`) dynamically select which input file (e.g., `job1.nex` or `job2.nex`) to use?",
    "answer": "It uses the `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` variable to construct the filename, as seen in `srun mb job${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}.nex`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are loaded in the `submit-mrbayes-cp.sh` job script for checkpointing?",
    "answer": "The `gcc` and `mrbayes/3.2.7` modules are loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the specified number of tasks (`--ntasks`) for the MrBayes checkpointing job array script?",
    "answer": "The script specifies `--ntasks=8`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the name of the example job script provided for MrBayes checkpointing with a job array?",
    "answer": "The example job script is named `submit-mrbayes-cp.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum number of sub-jobs allowed to run concurrently in the MrBayes checkpointing job array?",
    "answer": "Only one sub-job is allowed to run at a time, as indicated by `--array=1-2%1`."
