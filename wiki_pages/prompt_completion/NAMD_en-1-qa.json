    "answer": "Please refer to the [[Running jobs]] page for help on using the SLURM workload manager."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you increase the number of cores for a serial NAMD simulation job?",
    "answer": "You can increase the number for --cpus-per-task up to the maximum number of cores available on a cluster node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended flag to potentially improve NAMD runtimes in job scripts?",
    "answer": "Adding the `+setcpuaffinity` flag may improve performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD 3.0.1 module is loaded for a serial job?",
    "answer": "The `namd-multicore/3.0.1` module is loaded after `StdEnv/2023` and `gcc/12.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a UCX parallel CPU job example use for NAMD?",
    "answer": "This example uses 80 processes in total on 2 nodes, each node running 40 processes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What memory setting (`--mem`) means all memory per node in a SLURM script?",
    "answer": "`--mem=0` means all memory per node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific NAMD 3 input flag can improve performance considerably on GPUs?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3 added an input flag, `GPUresident on;`, which shifts more calculations to the GPU and can improve performance considerably."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you enable the `GPUresident on;` flag in NAMD 3?",
    "answer": "To use it, add the line `GPUresident on;` to your NAMD input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPU cores and GPUs are used in the single GPU job example?",
    "answer": "This example uses 8 CPU cores and 1 P100 GPU on a single node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the specifications of B\u00e9luga GPU nodes for NAMD jobs?",
    "answer": "B\u00e9luga GPU nodes have 40 cores and 4 GPUs per node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might NAMD report fewer cores being used than specified in a parallel GPU job with UCX?",
    "answer": "1 core per task has to be reserved for a communications thread, so NAMD will report that only 72 cores are being used but this is normal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is UCX compatible with all clusters?",
    "answer": "UCX can be used on all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What resource can help determine optimal conditions for NAMD jobs on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "A team at ACENET has created a Molecular Dynamics Performance Guide for Alliance clusters, which can help determine optimal conditions for NAMD jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for NAMD benchmarking regarding the number of steps?",
    "answer": "Vary the number of steps so that your system runs for a few minutes, and that timing information is collected in reasonable time intervals of at least a few seconds."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is efficiency calculated in the NAMD benchmarking results?",
    "answer": "Efficiency is computed from (time with 1 core) / (N * (time with N cores))."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the trade-off of requesting more cores for NAMD jobs?",
    "answer": "If you ask for more cores, your jobs will wait in the queue for a longer time, affecting your overall throughput."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD module is used for GPU simulations that span multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "NAMD verbs-smp module is used for runs spanning nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it generally more cost-effective to run NAMD with or without GPUs on Graham, and why?",
    "answer": "It is more cost effective to run with GPUs because a full GPU node job runs faster than it would on 4 non-GPU nodes, and a GPU node costs about twice what a non-GPU node costs."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might it be advisable to submit non-GPU jobs even if GPU jobs are more cost-effective?",
    "answer": "You may need to consider submitting non-GPU jobs if your waiting time for GPU jobs is too long, given that there are fewer GPU than CPU nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user run a newer NAMD version not yet installed as a module on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "You can download the binary from the NAMD website and modify it using `setrpaths.sh --path .` after extracting the archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find the NAMD User's guide for version 3.0.1?",
    "answer": "The NAMD User's guide for version 3.0.1 is available at https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/3.0.1/ug/."
