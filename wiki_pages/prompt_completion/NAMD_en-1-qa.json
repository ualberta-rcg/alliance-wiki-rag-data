  {
    "question": "Which cluster should NAMD 2.14 be used on if a GPU version is selected?",
    "answer": "NAMD 2.14 should be used only on narval cluster if the GPU version is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What technology should be used to run NAMD jobs that span nodes?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find help on using the SLURM workload manager for NAMD jobs?",
    "answer": "Please refer to the 'Running jobs' page for help on using the SLURM workload manager."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the number of cores be increased for a threaded NAMD simulation?",
    "answer": "You can increase the number for `--cpus-per-task` in the job script to use more cores, up to the maximum available on a cluster node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What NAMD module is used in the example script for a threaded job?",
    "answer": "The `namd-multicore/3.0.1` module is used in the example script for a threaded job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended value for `ntasks-per-node` for best performance of NAMD UCX jobs on fir, rorqual, nibi, and trillium clusters?",
    "answer": "For best performance, `ntasks-per-node` should be equal to the number of cores available on the node, which is 192 on fir, rorqual, nibi, and trillium."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should the UCX version of NAMD be used?",
    "answer": "The UCX version should only be used if the multicore version of NAMD is not sufficient for your needs and you need to run on multiple nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What NAMD module is used in the example script for a multi-node CPU UCX job?",
    "answer": "The `namd-ucx/3.0.1` module is used in the example script for a multi-node CPU UCX job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What input flag was added in NAMD 3 to improve GPU performance, and how is it used?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3 added an input flag, `GPUresident on;`, which shifts more calculations to the GPU to improve performance. To use it, add this line to your NAMD input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What NAMD module is used in the example script for a threaded GPU job?",
    "answer": "The `namd-multicore/3.0.1` module is used in the example script for a threaded GPU job."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is using multiple nodes justified for multi-node GPU NAMD jobs?",
    "answer": "Using multiple nodes for GPU NAMD jobs is justified only when your job can use them efficiently, as a single GPU node provides a great deal of computational power."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which cluster is the example multi-node UCX GPU job script specifically designed for?",
    "answer": "This example multi-node UCX GPU job script is for narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the Narval multi-node UCX GPU example, why might NAMD report fewer cores being used than requested?",
    "answer": "In the Narval multi-node UCX GPU example, 1 core per task has to be reserved for a communications thread, so NAMD will report that only 88 cores are being used, but this is normal."
  },
  {
