    "question": "What is NAMD?",
    "answer": "NAMD is a parallel, object-oriented molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What visualization package is NAMD integrated with for simulation preparation and analysis?",
    "answer": "Simulation preparation and analysis for NAMD is integrated into the VMD visualization package."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is NAMD typically made available to users?",
    "answer": "NAMD is installed by our software team and is available as a module."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted if a new version of NAMD is needed or if a user wants to perform their own installation?",
    "answer": "If a new version of NAMD is required or if for some reason you need to do your own installation, please contact Technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the latest version of NAMD mentioned and its release date?",
    "answer": "The latest version of NAMD is 3.0.2, released on August 27, 2025."
  },
  {
    "question": "Has NAMD 3.0.2 been installed on all clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, NAMD 3.0.2 has been installed on all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations of NAMD version 2.14 regarding GPUs?",
    "answer": "NAMD version 2.14 cannot run on H100 GPUs, so it should be used only on narval cluster if the GPU version is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be used to run NAMD jobs that span multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "To run jobs that span nodes, use UCX."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find help on using the SLURM workload manager for NAMD jobs?",
    "answer": "Users should refer to the 'Running jobs' page for help on using the SLURM workload manager."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended setting for `ntasks-per-node` in multi-node CPU UCX jobs to achieve best performance?",
    "answer": "For best performance, `ntasks-per-node` should be equal to the number of cores available on the node, meaning NAMD UCX jobs should use full nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should the UCX version of NAMD be used for multi-node CPU jobs instead of the multicore version?",
    "answer": "Only use the UCX version if the multicore version of NAMD is not sufficient for your needs and you need to run on multiple nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What input flag was added in NAMD 3 to improve GPU performance, and how is it used?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3 added an input flag, 'GPUresident on;', which shifts more calculations to the GPU and can be added to your NAMD input file to improve performance considerably."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might using multiple nodes for multi-node GPU jobs not always be justified?",
    "answer": "A single GPU node provides a great deal of computational power, so using multiple nodes is justified only when your job can use them efficiently."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key consideration for using NAMD 2.14 in multi-node UCX GPU jobs?",
    "answer": "NAMD 2.14 in this example should not be used on clusters with H100 GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the UCX version of NAMD 3.0.1 compatible with H100 GPUs available on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "The UCX version of NAMD 3.0.1 able to run on H100 is not yet installed on Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a multi-node UCX GPU job on Narval, how many cores per task are reserved for a communications thread?",
    "answer": "1 core per task has to be reserved for a communications thread in a multi-node UCX GPU job on Narval."
