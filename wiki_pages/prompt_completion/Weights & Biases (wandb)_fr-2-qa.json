  {
    "question": "How can the `wandb-test.sh` script be modified to run in online mode instead of offline mode?",
    "answer": "To run in online mode, you should save your wandb API key (e.g., in `.bash_profile` or by replacing `$API_KEY` directly) and then remove or comment out the `wandb offline` line in the script."

  {
    "question": "How are metrics logged in the `wandb-test.py` example?",
    "answer": "Metrics are logged in a loop using `wandb.log({'my_metric': my_metric})`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can offline wandb runs be synchronized with the Weights & Biases server?",
    "answer": "After an offline run, you will have a directory like `./wandb/offline-run*`. To synchronize all runs in this directory to the server, use the command `wandb sync ./wandb/offline-run*`."
  },
