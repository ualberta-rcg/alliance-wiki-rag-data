    "question": "How do you connect to a Rorqual, Fir, Nibi, or Narval cluster for X11 forwarding?",
    "answer": "Connect to the cluster using SSH with the `-X` or `-Y` flag for X11 forwarding."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start a graphical application like VMD for small visualizations on the connection node of Rorqual, Fir, Nibi, or Narval?",
    "answer": "First, load the VMD module using `module load vmd`, then execute `vmd`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you request interactive resources on a compute node for large visualizations on Rorqual, Fir, Nibi, or Narval?",
    "answer": "Use the command `salloc --time=1:00:0 --ntasks=1 --mem=3500 --account=def-someprof --x11`."
  },
  {
    "question": "After an interactive task is running on a compute node (Rorqual, Fir, Nibi, or Narval), how do you start a graphical application?",
    "answer": "Load the application module, for example `module load vmd`, and then run the application, e.g., `vmd`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might you request a test task on the Trillium cluster?",
    "answer": "Because execution time on connection nodes is limited, requesting a test task provides more time to explore and visualize data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an advantage of requesting a test task on Trillium?",
    "answer": "You would have access to 40 cores on each requested node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to use an interactive visualization session on Trillium?",
    "answer": "Connect via SSH to `trillium.alliancecan.ca` with the `-X` or `-Y` flag for X11 redirection."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request an interactive task on Trillium once connected via SSH?",
    "answer": "Run the command `debugjob`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after you run `debugjob` on Trillium?",
    "answer": "This will connect you to a compute node, for example, 'niaXYZW'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start a graphical application like VMD inside an interactive task on Trillium?",
    "answer": "Load the VMD module with `module load vmd`, then run `vmd`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of Xvfb?",
    "answer": "Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) allows applications that require a graphical display to run without actually showing the results on screen, as the results are saved to a file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run an application with Xvfb on a CPU?",
    "answer": "Use the command `xvfb-run <name-of-application>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run an application with Xvfb on a GPU?",
    "answer": "Use the command `xvfb-run vglrun -d egl <name-of-application>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a prerequisite for running Xvfb with a GPU?",
    "answer": "You must reserve a GPU for the task."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is benchmarking important when using GPUs with Xvfb?",
    "answer": "Benchmarking is important because if a GPU is overloaded, it might not be faster than a CPU, and GPUs are more costly to use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is X11 redirection not recommended for applications like MATLAB?",
    "answer": "Using X11 redirection can significantly slow down the connection to the server for such applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended for remotely starting and connecting to a graphical user interface for applications like MATLAB?",
    "answer": "Using VNC is recommended for remote startup and connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more information about VNC?",
    "answer": "More information can be found on the VNC wiki page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted to organize a visualization workshop at an institution?",
    "answer": "Interested parties should write to `support@tech.alliancecan.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which workshop on VisIt was held at HPCS 2016 in Edmonton?",
    "answer": "A VisIt workshop was presented by Marcelo Ponce and Alex Razoumov at HPCS 2016 in Edmonton."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who conducted the ParaView workshop in July 2017?",
    "answer": "Alex Razoumov conducted the ParaView workshop in July 2017."
  },
  {
    "question": "What topics were covered by Marcelo Ponce during the 2016 Ontario summer school?",
    "answer": "Marcelo Ponce covered Gnuplot, xmgrace, remote visualization tools (X-forwarding and VNC), and Python's matplotlib."
