    "question": "What three pieces of information are required to configure an existing ANSYS license server for use on a cluster?",
    "answer": "You need the fully qualified hostname (LICSERVER) of the server, the Ansys flex port (FLEXPORT) number (commonly 1055), and the Ansys licensing interconnect port (INTEPORT) number (commonly 2325)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I configure my `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file with license server information once I have the necessary details?",
    "answer": "Once the LICSERVER, FLEXPORT, and INTEPORT values are collected, you configure your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file by plugging these values into the `FILE: ansys.lic` template."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the common port numbers for Ansys Flex and Interconnect ports?",
    "answer": "The Ansys flex port (FLEXPORT) is commonly 1055, and the Ansys licensing interconnect port (INTEPORT) is commonly 2325."
  },
  {
    "question": "What additional information is needed if a local Ansys license server has never been set up for use on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "You will also need the static vendor port (VENDPORT) number from your local Ansys server administrator and confirmation that the `<servername>` (found in the first line of the license file) resolves to the same IP as LICSERVER on Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if the `<servername>` in the license file does not resolve to the same IP address as LICSERVER on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "If `<servername>` does not meet this requirement, you should request your license administrator to change it to either the same fully qualified hostname as LICSERVER or at least to a hostname that will resolve to the same IP address as LICSERVER remotely."
  },
  {
    "question": "After collecting all necessary information for a new Ansys license server setup, whom should I contact and what information should I send?",
    "answer": "You should send the LICSERVER, FLEXPORT, INTEPORT, and VENDPORT values by email to technical support, mentioning which Alliance cluster(s) you want to run Ansys jobs on."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after Alliance system administrators receive the license server setup request?",
    "answer": "Alliance system administrators will open the firewall to allow license checkout requests to reach your license server from the specified cluster compute nodes, and in return, you will receive a range of IP addresses to forward to your server administrator for opening the local firewall."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I test if my `ansys.lic` file is configured and working properly on a cluster?",
    "answer": "You can test it by running a sequence of commands on the cluster, starting with `cd /tmp`, `salloc` for resource allocation, `module load StdEnv/2023; module load ansys/2023R2`, and then using `lmutil lmstat -c $ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE` to check for 'Success' or 'Fail'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What indicates a successful Ansys license checkout when testing the `ansys.lic` configuration?",
    "answer": "If `Success` is output, license checkouts should work when jobs are submitted to the queue."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if the Ansys license check outputs 'Fail'?",
    "answer": "If `Fail` is output, jobs will likely fail, requiring a problem ticket to be submitted to resolve the issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to test the Ansys license with the same module version used in Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "It is important to use the same Ansys module version to ensure that license checkouts will work when jobs are run in the queue, as using a newer module version for testing with an outdated remote license server could cause a failure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are Ansys simulations typically forward compatible or backwards compatible?",
    "answer": "Ansys simulations are typically forward compatible but NOT backwards compatible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can an Ansys simulation created with an older version be run with a newer version?",
    "answer": "Yes, simulations created using an older version of Ansys can be expected to load and run fine with any newer version."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I determine which version of Ansys Fluent was used to create a `.cas` file?",
    "answer": "You can check by grepping the `.cas` file using a command like `grep -ia fluent combustor.cas` to look for clues."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find detailed platform support information for Ansys software?",
    "answer": "Ansys provides detailed platform support information describing software/hardware compatibility for the Current Release and Previous Releases on their website."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any Ansys packages supported under Windows but not under Linux (and thus not on Alliance systems)?",
    "answer": "Yes, the 'Platform Support by Application / Product' PDF indicates which packages, such as Spaceclaim, are supported under Windows but not under Linux."
