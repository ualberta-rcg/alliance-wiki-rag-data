  {
    "question": "How do I use an existing ANSYS License server on the cluster?",
    "answer": "Contact your local Ansys license server administrator to get the fully qualified hostname (LICSERVER), the Ansys flex port (FLEXPORT, commonly 1055), and the Ansys licensing interconnect port (INTEPORT, commonly 2325). Then, configure your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file with these values."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is needed for a local Ansys license server that has never been set up on the Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "In addition to the hostname, flex port, and interconnect port, you will need the static vendor port (VENDPORT) number and confirmation that the `<servername>` in your license file resolves to the same IP as LICSERVER on Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important for the <servername> to resolve to the same IP as LICSERVER?",
    "answer": "If `<servername>` does not resolve to the same IP, Ansys license checkouts will not work on any remote cluster at the Alliance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if my local Ansys license server's <servername> doesn't resolve correctly?",
    "answer": "Request your license administrator to change `<servername>` to either the same fully qualified hostname as LICSERVER or at least to a hostname that will resolve to the same IP address as LICSERVER remotely."
  },
  {
    "question": "After collecting license server details for a new setup, who should I contact?",
    "answer": "Send the hostname, flex port, interconnect port, and static vendor port by email to technical support, specifying which Alliance cluster(s) you want to run Ansys jobs on."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after I contact technical support to set up a new Ansys license server?",
    "answer": "Alliance system administrators will open the firewall, and you will receive a range of IP addresses to provide to your server administrator, who will then open the local firewall for inbound Ansys license connections on the FLEXPORT, INTEPORT, and VENDPORT."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I test if my `ansys.lic` file is correctly configured and working?",
    "answer": "Copy and paste a specific sequence of commands on the cluster you're using, which involves loading the Ansys module and running `lmutil lmstat -c $ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command sequence is used to check the Ansys license configuration?",
    "answer": "The sequence is `cd /tmp`, `salloc --time=1:0:0 --mem=1000M --account=def-YOURUSERID`, `module load StdEnv/2023; module load ansys/2023R2`, and then `$EBROOTANSYS/v$(echo ${EBVERSIONANSYS:2:2}${EBVERSIONANSYS:5:1})/licensingclient/linx64/lmutil lmstat -c $ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE 1> /dev/null && echo Success || echo Fail`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What indicates a successful Ansys license checkout during testing?",
    "answer": "`Success` will be output if the license checkouts are working properly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if the Ansys license checkout test outputs `Fail`?",
    "answer": "If `Fail` is output, jobs will likely fail, and you should submit a problem ticket to resolve the issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are Ansys simulations typically backwards compatible?",
    "answer": "No, Ansys simulations are NOT backwards compatible; they are typically forward compatible."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does forward compatibility mean for Ansys simulations?",
    "answer": "Simulations created using an older version of Ansys can be expected to load and run fine with any newer version, for example, ansys/2022R2 on ansys/2023R2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What might happen if a simulation created with a newer Ansys version is run with an older version?",
    "answer": "While it might be possible to start, random error messages or crashing will likely occur."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I identify the Fluent version used to create a `.cas` or `.cas.h5` file?",
    "answer": "You can try grepping the file, for example: `$ grep -ia fluent combustor.cas` or `$ grep -ia fluent cavity.cas.h5`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find detailed Ansys platform support information?",
    "answer": "Detailed platform support information, including software/hardware compatibility, is available on the Ansys website for the Current Release and Previous Releases."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which platform support document is particularly relevant for Alliance users?",
    "answer": "The 'Platform Support by Application / Product' PDF is of special interest."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the 'Platform Support by Application / Product' PDF important for Alliance users?",
    "answer": "It shows which packages, such as Spaceclaim, are supported under Windows but not under Linux, and therefore not available on the Alliance systems."
