  },
  {
    "question": "How do Ansys service packs affect module naming starting with Ansys 2024?",
    "answer": "Starting with Ansys 2024, a separate Ansys module will appear on the clusters with a decimal and two digits after the release number whenever a service pack is installed. For example, `ansys/2024R1.03` indicates Service Pack 3 for the 2024R1 release."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I load the latest Ansys module version with the latest service pack?",
    "answer": "You can typically load the latest module version equipped with the latest installed service pack by simply running `module load ansys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find detailed descriptions of Ansys 2024R1 service pack changes?",
    "answer": "Detailed descriptions of what each service pack does, starting with Ansys 2024R1, can be found by searching the link `https://storage.ansys.com/staticfiles/cp/Readme/release2024R1/info_combined.pdf` for 'Service Pack Details'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does the Ansys software suite require special instructions for parallel jobs on clusters?",
    "answer": "The Ansys software suite comes with multiple MPI implementations, but none of them natively support the Slurm scheduler, necessitating special instructions for each Ansys package to start a parallel job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical steps to run an Ansys Fluent job on a cluster?",
    "answer": "The typical procedure involves preparing the Fluent job in Ansys Workbench, exporting the case and data files, transferring them to the cluster, creating a journal file to run the solver, and finally, after running the job, downloading and importing the data file back into Fluent."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I export a Fluent case file from Ansys Workbench?",
    "answer": "You can export a Fluent case file from Ansys Workbench by going to `File > Export > Case\u2026` or by locating it in your project's files (often named `FFF-1.cas.gz`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of a Fluent journal file?",
    "answer": "The purpose of a Fluent journal file is to automate the process of loading case/data files, running the solver for a specified number of iterations, and writing the simulation results."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if Fluent jobs frequently fail due to license shortages?",
    "answer": "If jobs frequently fail due to license shortages, consider modifying your script to requeue your job up to 4 times. However, it's strongly recommended to monitor Slurm output files to confirm each requeue attempt is license-related, and manually kill jobs that fail due to simulation issues."
