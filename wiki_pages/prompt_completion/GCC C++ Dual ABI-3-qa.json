    "question": "What is the default ABI used by the compiler if only `-std=c++98` or `-std=c++11` is specified without `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI`?",
    "answer": "If only `-std=c++98` or `-std=c++11` is used, the ABI does not differ, and the compiler will use the default (newer) ABI."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you explicitly choose between the old and new ABI when compiling with `-std=c++98` or `-std=c++11`?",
    "answer": "By setting `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI` to `0` (for the old ABI) or `1` (for the new ABI) along with using `-std=c++98` or `-std=c++11`, the desired ABI can be explicitly chosen."
  },
  {
    "question": "What compiler flag is required to link to binaries compiled using the old ABI when using GCC v5.1 or higher?",
    "answer": "To link to binaries compiled using the old ABI with GCC v5.1 or higher, one must specify `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` when compiling the C++ code."
