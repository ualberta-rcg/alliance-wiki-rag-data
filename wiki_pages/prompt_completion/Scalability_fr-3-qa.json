  {
    "question": "What is the duration of execution when 128 cores are used for a problem size of 128,000 in the weak scalability analysis?",
    "answer": "The duration of execution is 3966 seconds."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is efficiency calculated for weak scalability tests?",
    "answer": "Efficiency is calculated by dividing the reference execution duration (with 1 core) by the execution duration with 'n' cores, and then converting the result to a percentage."

  {
    "question": "Under what communication conditions is weak scalability usually preferable?",
    "answer": "It is usually preferable when a parallel program favors communication with nearby entities."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a parallel program does not favor communication with nearby entities when using weak scalability?",
    "answer": "It will generally cause a decrease in performance, as observed with the Fast Fourier Transform."
