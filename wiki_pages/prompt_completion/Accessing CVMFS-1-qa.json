  },
  {
    "question": "What are the requirements for installing CVMFS on a single system?",
    "answer": "For a single system, CVMFS requires a supported operating system, FUSE support, approximately 50 GB of local storage for the cache (5-10 GB for light use), and outbound HTTP access to the internet or local proxy servers."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much local storage is typically needed for the CVMFS cache?",
    "answer": "Approximately 50 GB of local storage is needed for the cache, though 5-10 GB may suffice for light use on a personal computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What network access is required for CVMFS?",
    "answer": "Outbound HTTP access to the internet, or at least to one or more local proxy servers, is required."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do if your system lacks FUSE support, local storage, or has limited network connectivity for CVMFS?",
    "answer": "If your system has such restrictions, you may be able to use 'some other option' detailed in the documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the additional considerations for deploying CVMFS on multiple systems, such as a cluster?",
    "answer": "For multiple systems, it is recommended to deploy forward caching HTTP proxy servers (at least two) and to synchronize the identity of the `cvmfs` service account across all client nodes before CVMFS installation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are forward caching HTTP proxy servers recommended for multiple CVMFS clients?",
    "answer": "They are recommended to improve performance and bandwidth usage, especially with a large number of clients."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum recommended number of local proxy servers for a site with multiple CVMFS clients?",
    "answer": "At least two local proxies are recommended to avoid a single point of failure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to synchronize the `cvmfs` service account identity across client nodes before installing CVMFS?",
    "answer": "Synchronizing the `cvmfs` service account identity facilitates the use of an alien cache and is easier to do initially than to change later."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the minimal supported operating systems for the CVMFS software environment?",
    "answer": "Supported operating systems include Linux (Kernel 2.6.32+ for 2016/2018 environments, 3.2+ for 2020 environment), Windows with WSL2 and a compatible Linux distribution, and Mac OS only through a virtual machine."
  },
  {
    "question": "What CPU instruction sets are minimally required for the software environment?",
    "answer": "An x86 CPU supporting at least one of SSE3, AVX, AVX2, or AVX512 instruction sets is required."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the optimal requirements for the software environment?",
    "answer": "Optimal requirements include Slurm or Torque scheduler, Ethernet, InfiniBand, or OmniPath network interconnect, an NVidia GPU with CUDA drivers (7.5 or newer), and as few Linux packages installed as possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is a Slurm or Torque scheduler optimal for the environment?",
    "answer": "A Slurm or Torque scheduler is optimal for tight integration with OpenMPI applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of network interconnect is optimal for parallel applications?",

  {
    "question": "What is recommended for the local CVMFS cache before installation?",
    "answer": "It is recommended that the local CVMFS cache be on a dedicated file system, provisioned before CVMFS installation, to prevent storage usage from being shared with other applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default location for the local CVMFS cache?",
    "answer": "The default location for the local CVMFS cache is `/var/lib/cvmfs`."
