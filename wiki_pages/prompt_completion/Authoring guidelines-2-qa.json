  {
    "question": "How should graphic design and content be handled in the wiki layout?",
    "answer": "Graphic design should be separated from content as much as possible. This means avoiding extra line breaks for vertical spacing, not indenting paragraphs with tabs or spaces, and not adding extra spaces after a sentence. Style adjustments should be made universally using stylesheets and templates."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the guidelines for using screenshots in wiki pages?",
    "answer": "Screenshots are good for how-tos and tutorials. They should float to the right-hand side and be scaled down. If important information becomes unreadable, a cropped picture might be better, or a caption can remind the reader to 'Click on the image for a larger version.'"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to leave a blank line at the end of each section before a header?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the overall process for translating a wiki page?",
    "answer": "To translate a page, one first writes the content in the original language, then marks the page for translation. A human then translates it using tools provided by the MediaWiki Translate extension, and finally, a second human reviews the translation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do users see if a page has not yet been translated or if a translation has not been reviewed?",
    "answer": "If a page has not yet been translated, users can see the page in the original language. If a translation has not yet been reviewed, users can see the non-reviewed translation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when a page is marked for translation?",
    "answer": "Marking a page for translation triggers an analysis of its content, splitting it into 'translation units' such as titles, paragraphs, or images. These units are then translated individually."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of splitting content into translation units?",
    "answer": "Splitting content into translation units allows for individual translation, ensures that a modification to a page doesn't require translating the entire page again, and enables tracking of the percentage of a page that is translated or outdated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step when marking a new page for translation if the original language is French?",
    "answer": "If the original language of the page is French, the first step is to change it on [[Special:PageLanguage]]."

    "answer": "Content to be translated must be enclosed within `<translate>` and `</translate>` tags."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should code blocks and wiki markup be handled when marking a new page for translation?",
    "answer": "Code blocks should be enclosed in `</translate> <translate>` tags to exclude them from translation. Likewise, wiki markup (tables, tags, etc.) should also be excluded from translation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tag needs to be at the very top of a page to display language options?",
    "answer": "The tag `<languages />` must appear at the very top of the page to show a box with the list of languages the page is translated into."
  },
  {
    "question": "After preparing the tags, what are the next steps to mark a new page for translation?",
    "answer": "After preparing the tags, go to 'View' mode, click on 'Mark this page for translation', review the translation units, specify 'fr' or 'en' as the priority language in the 'Priority languages' section, and then click 'Mark this version for translation'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be avoided when marking changes to an already translated page for translation?",
    "answer": "When making changes to an already translated page, you must NOT change or manually edit the automatically generated tags of the form `<!--T:3-->`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are involved in marking changes to an existing page for translation?",
    "answer": "To mark changes for translation: ensure new text is within `<translate>` tags, code blocks and wiki markup are excluded from translation, go to 'View' mode and click 'marked for translation' (when prompted 'This page has changes since it was last marked for translation.'), review translation units, verify 'fr' or 'en' as the priority language, and finally, click 'Mark this version for translation'."
