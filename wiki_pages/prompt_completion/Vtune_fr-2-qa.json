    "question": "How do you load the necessary modules for VTune on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You load the modules by running `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2020 vtune`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch the VTune graphical interface on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "After loading the required modules, execute the command `vtune-gui`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules need to be loaded to prepare for an MPI example with VTune?",
    "answer": "First, load `StdEnv/2020`, then load `vtune` using `module load StdEnv/2020` followed by `module load vtune`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run an MPI program for profiling with VTune in a job or interactive session?",
    "answer": "After compiling your MPI program, run it using `srun aps your_mpi_program.x` inside a job or an interactive session started by an `salloc` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the profiling data stored after running an MPI program with `srun aps`?",
    "answer": "The profiling data will be stored in a directory called `aps_result_YYYYMMDD`, where `YYYYMMDD` is the current date."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you generate a basic summary report from the MPI profiling data?",
    "answer": "To get the basic summary report, run `aps-report -D aps_result_YYYYMMDD`, replacing `YYYYMMDD` with the actual date in the directory name."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the output format of the `aps-report` command and how can it be viewed?",
    "answer": "The `aps-report` command creates an HTML file, which can be copied to your own computer and viewed in a browser."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the report generated by `aps-report`?",
    "answer": "The report will clearly identify performance issues that are affecting your code."
