  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of SSW?",
    "answer": "SSW is a fast implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, designed to perform protein and genome alignment using Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) instructions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which programming languages can utilize the SSW library API?",
    "answer": "The SSW library provides an API that can be flexibly used by programs written in C, C++, and other languages."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much faster is the current SSW implementation compared to an ordinary Smith-Waterman algorithm?",
    "answer": "The current version of the SSW implementation is approximately 50 times faster than an ordinary Smith-Waterman."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of output can SSW provide for alignments?",
    "answer": "SSW can return the Smith-Waterman score, alignment location, and traceback path (cigar) of the optimal alignment accurately, and also the sub-optimal alignment score and location heuristically."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the homepage for SSW?",
    "answer": "The homepage for SSW is https://github.com/mengyao/Complete-Striped-Smith-Waterman-Library."

  {
    "question": "What is Stacks used for in bioinformatics?",
    "answer": "Stacks is a software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences, such as those generated on the Illumina platform, to build genetic maps and conduct population genomics and phylogeography."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of data is Stacks designed to work with?",
    "answer": "Stacks was developed to work with restriction enzyme-based data, such specifically RAD-seq."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some of the available versions for the Stacks software?",
    "answer": "Some available versions for Stacks include 2.53, 2.55, 2.57, 2.59, 2.60, 2.62, 2.64, 2.66, and 2.67."

  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of STAR software?",
    "answer": "STAR aligns RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using uncompressed suffix arrays."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of STAR are listed?",
    "answer": "Listed versions for STAR include 2.7.5a, 2.7.8a, 2.7.9a, 2.7.11a, and 2.7.11b."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does STAR-Fusion do?",
    "answer": "STAR-Fusion utilizes the STAR aligner to identify candidate fusion transcripts supported by Illumina reads and further processes the output to map junction reads and spanning reads to a reference annotation set."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the version of STAR-Fusion available?",
    "answer": "The available version for STAR-Fusion is 1.10.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide the homepage for STAR-Fusion?",
    "answer": "The homepage for STAR-Fusion is https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion."
