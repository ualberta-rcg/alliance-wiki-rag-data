    "answer": "The 'structure' program is a free software package used for analyzing multi-locus genotype data to investigate population structure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What capabilities does the 'structure' program offer?",
    "answer": "The 'structure' program can infer distinct populations, assign individuals to populations, study hybrid zones, identify migrants and admixed individuals, and estimate population allele frequencies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of the 'structure' program is available?",
    "answer": "Version 2.3.4 of the 'structure' program is available."
