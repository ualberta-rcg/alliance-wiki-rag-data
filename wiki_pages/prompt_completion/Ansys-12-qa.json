    "question": "How can User-Defined Functions (UDFs) be utilized with Discrete Phase Models (DPM) in Ansys Fluent?",
    "answer": "UDFs can be used to customize Discrete Phase Models (DPM) in Ansys Fluent."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find detailed information about customizing Discrete Phase Models (DPM) with UDFs?",
    "answer": "Detailed information can be found in \"Part III: Solution Mode | Chapter 24: Modeling Discrete Phase | 24.2 Steps for Using the Discrete Phase Models| 24.2.6 User-Defined Functions\" of the `2024R2 Fluent Users Guide` and \"Part I: Creating and Using User Defined Functions | Chapter 2: DEFINE Macros | 2.5 Discrete Phase Model (DPM) DEFINE Macros\" of the `2024R2 Fluent Customization Manual`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are \"Point Properties\" used for in DPM simulations, and what variables do they typically include?",
    "answer": "\"Point Properties\" are used to define the injection of a set of particles in a DPM simulation. They include variables such as source position, initial trajectory, mass flow rate, time duration, and temperature, depending on the injection type."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I define particle injections using the GUI in Ansys Fluent for DPM simulations?",
    "answer": "In the GUI, you would click the Physics panel, then Discrete Phase to open the `Discrete Phase Model` box. After that, click the `Injections` button, then the `Create` button in the `Injections` dialog box to create one or more injections."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial injection types available from the \"Injection Type\" pulldown menu in the \"Set Injection Properties\" dialog?",
    "answer": "The first four injection types available from the \"Injection Type\" pulldown menu are \"single, group, surface, flat-fan-atomizer\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I specify \"Point Properties\" by reading an injection text file in the Ansys Fluent GUI?",
    "answer": "To specify \"Point Properties\" by reading an injection text file, select \"file\" from the \"Injection Type\" pulldown in the \"Set Injection Properties\" dialog. Then, click the `File` button and select your injection text file (commonly with a .inj extension)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I verify that an injection text file was read successfully by Fluent?",
    "answer": "If there are no problems with the file, no Console error or warning message will appear in Fluent. You should then see the specified Injection name in the \"Injections\" dialog box and be able to List its Particles and Properties in the console."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I enable the \"Interaction with Continuous Phase\" setting for DPM in Fluent?",
    "answer": "To enable this setting, open the Discrete Phase Model Dialog Box and select \"Interaction with Continuous Phase\", which will enable updating DPM source terms every flow iteration. This setting can be saved in your cas file or added via the journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the DPM injection setup steps be automated using a journal file?",
    "answer": "Yes, once an injection is confirmed working in the GUI, the steps can be automated by adding commands to the journal file after solution initialization. An example command for enabling coupled calculations is `/define/models/dpm/interaction/coupled-calculations yes`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example of journal file commands to configure DPM injections.",
    "answer": "Example commands include: `/define/models/dpm/interaction/coupled-calculations yes`, `/define/models/dpm/injections/delete-injection injection-0:1`, `/define/models/dpm/injections/create injection-0:1 no yes file no zinjection01.inj no no no no`, `/define/models/dpm/injections/list-particles injection-0:1`, and `/define/models/dpm/injections/list-injection-properties injection-0:1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the format description for steady injection files used in DPM simulations?",
    "answer": "The format for steady injection files is described in subsection \"Part III: Solution Mode | Chapter 24: Modeling Discrete Phase | 24.3. Setting Initial Conditions for the Discrete Phase | 24.3.13 Point Properties for File Injections | 24.3.13.1 Steady File Format\" of the `2024R2 Fluent Customization Manual`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I view a summary of command-line options for `cfx5solve`?",
    "answer": "You can print a summary of command-line options by running `cfx5solve -help` after manually loading the same module version that is used in your Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default precision mode for `cfx5solve`, and how can it be changed?",
    "answer": "By default, `cfx5solve` runs in single precision (`-single`). To run in double precision, you need to add the `-double` option, which will also double memory requirements."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default mesh element limits that `cfx5solve` can support?",
    "answer": "By default, `cfx5solve` can support meshes with up to 80 million structured elements or 200 million unstructured elements."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can `cfx5solve` be used for meshes larger than the default limits?",
    "answer": "For larger meshes with up to 2 billion elements, you need to add the `-large` option to the `cfx5solve` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "For which components can command-line options be specified when using `cfx5solve`?",
    "answer": "Command-line options can be specified for the Partitioner, Interpolator, or Solver."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more details on `cfx5solve` command-line options and their combinations?",
    "answer": "You should consult the `ANSYS CFX-Solver Manager User's Guide` for further details."
