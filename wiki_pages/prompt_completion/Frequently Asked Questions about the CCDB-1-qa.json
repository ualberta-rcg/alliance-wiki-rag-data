  {
    "question": "What is the CCDB?",
    "answer": "The CCDB is the portal to your account with the Alliance where you can find information on your roles in projects, allocated resources, and statistics on your use of these resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What actions can a user perform on the CCDB portal?",
    "answer": "On the CCDB portal, users can register, manage personal information and roles, apply for the Resource Allocation Competition (RAC), and manage RAP information and membership."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a CCI?",
    "answer": "A CCI is a unique personal and national identifier created when you register at https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca. It is a string of 3 letters, a dash, and 3 digits (e.g., abc-123)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the format of a CCI?",
    "answer": "A CCI is a string of 3 letters followed by a dash and 3 digits, for example, abc-123."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is eligible to register with the CCDB?",
    "answer": "To register with the CCDB, you must either be a faculty member at a Canadian institution registered with the CCDB, or be sponsored by such a faculty member. Sponsored individuals can include graduate students and research staff."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can graduate students register with the CCDB?",
    "answer": "Yes, graduate students can register with the CCDB if they are sponsored by a faculty member at a Canadian institution that is registered with the CCDB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'role' in the CCDB system?",
    "answer": "A role is an identifier that represents the combination of a person's position (e.g., faculty, graduate student), institution, and sponsor, and is required to access computational resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why must a new role be applied for when institution, sponsor, or position changes?",
    "answer": "When a user changes institution, sponsor, or position, they must apply for a new role (rather than updating an old one) to maintain accurate records for usage reporting to governmental funding agencies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the convention for a CCRI?",
    "answer": "The CCRI follows the convention of a CCI followed by a dash and 2 digits. For example, for CCI abc-123, a first role would be abc-123-01."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a user's CCRI change if they have multiple roles?",
    "answer": "For a user with CCI abc-123, the CCRI for a first role would be abc-123-01, and for a second role, it would be abc-123-02, following the convention of adding a dash and 2 digits."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a CCRI?",
    "answer": "A CCRI is the unique identifier for your role. Since one person may have multiple roles over time, one CCI may be associated with more than one CCRI."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can one person have multiple CCRIs?",
    "answer": "Yes, one person can have multiple CCRIs because a single CCI can be associated with more than one role over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is attributed to a CCRI?",
    "answer": "Every job that runs on a national cluster is attributed to a CCRI."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do PIs access national computational resources?",
    "answer": "PIs access national computational resources through Resource Allocation Projects (RAP)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What identifies a Resource Allocation Project (RAP)?",
    "answer": "Each RAP is identified by a RAPI (Resource Allocation Project Identifier) and an associated group name."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the term 'RAP' used instead of 'project' for resource allocation?",
    "answer": "The term 'project' is considered too ambiguous for reporting purposes, so 'RAP' is used as a name that does not have implicit meanings and represents the group of researchers to whom resources are allocated."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are computing resources allocated to individuals or groups?",
    "answer": "Computing resources are not allocated to individuals; they are allocated to groups of researchers, represented by a RAP."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main types of RAPs?",
    "answer": "The two main types of RAPs are Default RAPs and RAC RAPs."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is a Default RAP created?",
    "answer": "A Default RAP is automatically created when a PI role is activated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of resources are managed via a Default RAP?",
    "answer": "Default and Rapid Access Service quotas for storage and cloud resources are managed via the Default RAP."
  },
  {
    "question": "What priority do Default RAPs provide for compute resources?",
    "answer": "The Default RAP allows PIs and sponsored users to make opportunistic use of compute resources with the default (lowest) priority."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the naming convention for a Default RAP on CCDB?",
    "answer": "On CCDB, a Default RAP uses the convention `def-profname`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is a RAC RAP created?",
    "answer": "A RAC RAP is created when the PI receives an award through the Resource Allocation Competition (RAC) application process."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical form of a RAC RAPI?",
    "answer": "The RAC RAPI typically takes the form `abc-123-ab`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are typical group name forms for RAC RAPs with HPC allocations?",
    "answer": "For HPC allocations, RAC RAP group names typically take the form `rrg-profname-xx` or `rpp-profname-xx`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are typical group name forms for RAC RAPs with Cloud allocations?",
    "answer": "For Cloud allocations, RAC RAP group names typically take the form `crg-profname-xx` or `cpp-profname-xx`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a group name in the context of RAPs?",
    "answer": "A group name is an alias for the Research Allocation Project Identifier (RAPI). It has a one-to-one mapping with a RAPI but is often easier for users to remember."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical group name convention for an RRG/HPC resource RAP?",
    "answer": "The typical group name convention for an RRG/HPC resource RAP is `rrg-[profname][-xx]`."
