  {
    "question": "What is the general recommendation for interactive rendering on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "For interactive rendering, client-server visualization with interactive or high-priority nodes is recommended as much as possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the general recommendation for non-interactive visualization on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "For non-interactive visualization, batch tasks with regular compute nodes are recommended."

    "answer": "Less efficient options include X11 forwarding and VNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does client-server interactive visualization work?",
    "answer": "In client-server mode, data is processed on the remote cluster with CPU or GPU rendering, while you work with a client user interface on your local computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which visualization software supports client-server mode?",
    "answer": "ParaView and VisIt support client-server mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should X11 forwarding be avoided for remote windows?",
    "answer": "X11 forwarding should generally be avoided for intensive graphical processing because of many interactions and slower speed compared to VNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a prerequisite for using X11 forwarding on your local computer?",
    "answer": "An X server must be installed on your computer to use X11 forwarding."
