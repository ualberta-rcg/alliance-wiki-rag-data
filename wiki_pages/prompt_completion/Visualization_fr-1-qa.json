  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for interactive rendering on clusters?",
    "answer": "For interactive rendering, client-server visualization with interactive or high-priority nodes is recommended as much as possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should non-interactive visualization tasks be handled on clusters?",
    "answer": "For non-interactive visualization, batch tasks with regular compute nodes are recommended."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are less efficient options for remote user interfaces on clusters?",
    "answer": "Less efficient options include X11 redirection and VNC, which may be the only UI options for some packages."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does client-server interactive visualization work?",
    "answer": "In client-server mode (with ParaView and VisIt), data is processed on the remote cluster using CPU or GPU rendering, while you interact with a client user interface on your local computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find instructions to configure client-server visualization?",
    "answer": "Configuration instructions for client-server visualization can be found on the ParaView and VisIt wiki pages."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is X11 redirection suitable for intensive graphical processing?",
    "answer": "Generally, X11 redirection should be avoided for intensive graphical processing because of many interactions and slower speed compared to VNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required on my computer to use X11 forwarding for remote windows?",
    "answer": "An X server must be installed on your computer to use X11 forwarding."
