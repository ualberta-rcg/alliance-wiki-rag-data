    "question": "What is the purpose of the Abaqus SHARCNET Academic License User Agreement?",
    "answer": "The agreement confirms that a user will only use 'SIMULIA Academic Software' with tokens from the SHARCNET license server for specific academic and research purposes on SHARCNET hardware."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the four main conditions for using the SHARCNET academic license?",
    "answer": "The conditions are: 1) use on SHARCNET hardware where the software is installed, 2) affiliation with a Canadian degree-granting academic institution, 3) for education, institutional, or instruction purposes (not commercial/contractual with unpublishable results), and 4) for experimental, theoretical, or digital research work up to proof-of-concept in a laboratory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the Abaqus license file be configured for SHARCNET systems?",
    "answer": "The `~/.licenses/abaqus.lic` file should contain `prepend_path(\"LM_LICENSE_FILE\",\"27050@license3.sharcnet.ca\")` and `prepend_path(\"ABAQUSLM_LICENSE_FILE\",\"27050@license3.sharcnet.ca\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which SHARCNET systems are compatible with the provided license file configuration?",
    "answer": "The license file configuration is usable on Graham, gra-vdi, and Dusky systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be checked if an Abaqus job fails with a 'Segmentation fault' error in the Slurm output?",
    "answer": "Verify that your `abaqus.lic` file contains `ABAQUSLM_LICENSE_FILE` to support abaqus/2020."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be checked if an Abaqus job fails with a 'License server machine is down or not responding' error?",
    "answer": "Verify that your `abaqus.lic` file contains `LM_LICENSE_FILE` to support abaqus/6.14.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you prepare to query the SHARCNET Abaqus license server?",
    "answer": "Log into graham using `ssh graham.alliancecan.ca`, then load the necessary modules with `module load StdEnv/2020` and `module load abaqus`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command checks the SHARCNET license server for started and queued jobs?",
    "answer": "Run `abaqus licensing lmstat -c $LM_LICENSE_FILE -a | egrep \"Users|start|queued\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check for started, queued, and reserved jobs on the SHARCNET license server?",
    "answer": "Use the command `abaqus licensing lmstat -c $LM_LICENSE_FILE -a | egrep \"Users|start|queued|RESERVATION\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command checks the SHARCNET license server for availability of only CAE, Standard, and Explicit products?",
    "answer": "Execute `abaqus licensing lmstat -c $LM_LICENSE_FILE -a | grep \"Users of\" | egrep \"cae|standard|explicit\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does it signify when an Abaqus job is reported as 'queued' by `lmstat`?",
    "answer": "A 'queued' job means it has entered the 'Running' state from Slurm's perspective, is idle on a compute node, and is waiting for a license. This consumes CPU time and impacts account priority."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users prevent license shortage issues when submitting multiple Abaqus jobs?",
    "answer": "Users can employ job dependencies, job arrays, or set up Slurm email notifications to know when a job completes before manually submitting another."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can memory usage (`#SBATCH --mem=`) be optimized for completed Abaqus jobs?",
    "answer": "For completed jobs, use `seff JobNumber` to check 'Memory Efficiency'. If it's below ~90%, decrease the `#SBATCH --mem=` value in the Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can CPU usage (`#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=`) be optimized for completed Abaqus jobs?",
    "answer": "For completed jobs, use `seff JobNumber` to check 'CPU Efficiency'. If it's below ~90%, perform scaling tests to find the optimal number of CPUs and update the `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=` value."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can memory and CPU usage be monitored for running Abaqus jobs?",
    "answer": "Use `srun --jobid=29821580 --pty top -d 5 -u $USER` to monitor `%CPU`, `%MEM`, and `RES` for each Abaqus parent process on the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the formula used to calculate Abaqus tokens based on the number of cores?",
    "answer": "The formula is `TOKENS = floor[5 X CORES^0.422]`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many additional tokens are required for each GPU used?",
    "answer": "Each GPU used requires 1 additional token."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is eligible to use the Western Abaqus site license?",
    "answer": "Only Western researchers are permitted to use the Western site license."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which hardware systems can the Western Abaqus license be used?",
    "answer": "The Western license can only be used on hardware located at Western's campus, with the Dusky cluster being the currently eligible system. Graham and gra-vdi are excluded."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should Western researchers inquire about using the Western Abaqus license?",
    "answer": "Contact the Western Abaqus license server administrator at `jmilner@robarts.ca`, providing your username and potentially making arrangements to purchase tokens."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure the Abaqus license file for the Western license?",
    "answer": "The `~/.licenses/abaqus.lic` file should contain `prepend_path(\"LM_LICENSE_FILE\",\"27000@license4.sharcnet.ca\")` and `prepend_path(\"ABAQUSLM_LICENSE_FILE\",\"27000@license4.sharcnet.ca\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if problems arise with the Western Abaqus license after configuration?",
    "answer": "Submit a problem ticket to technical support, specifying that you are using the Abaqus Western license on Dusky, and include the failed job number and any error messages."
