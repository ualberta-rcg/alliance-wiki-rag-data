  {
    "question": "How can Ansys EDT be executed interactively in batch mode?",
    "answer": "Ansys EDT can be run interactively in batch mode (without a graphical interface) by first starting an `salloc` session with specific options, then copying and pasting the complete `ansysedt` command from `script-local-cmd.sh`, ensuring $YOUR_AEDT_FILE is manually specified."

    "answer": "Tasks can be submitted to a cluster queue using the command `sbatch script-name.sh` with one of the provided single-node Slurm scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which cluster were the provided Slurm scripts for AnsysEDT tested as of January 2023?",
    "answer": "As of January 2023, these Slurm scripts were tested only on Graham."
  },
  {
    "question": "What parameters need to be specified before using the Slurm scripts for AnsysEDT?",
    "answer": "Before using the Slurm scripts, you need to specify the simulation time, memory, number of cores, and replace `YOUR_AEDT_FILE` with the name of your input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user obtain a complete list of command-line options for AnsysEDT?",
    "answer": "A complete list of command-line options can be obtained by starting AnsysEDT in graphical mode with the commands `ansysedt -help` or `ansysedt -Batchoptionhelp`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `#SBATCH --ntasks` directive in the example Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "The `#SBATCH --ntasks` directive is used to specify the number of cores to request for the job, with examples like 40 for Beluga, 32 or 48 for Cedar, 32 or 44 for Graham, and 64 for Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which AnsysEDT module version is recommended in the example Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "The example Slurm scripts recommend loading `ansysedt/2023R2` (or newer) after loading `StdEnv/2023`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a test example file copied for use with the Slurm script?",
    "answer": "A test example can be copied using `cp -f $EBROOTANSYSEDT/AnsysEM21.2/Linux64/Examples/HFSS/Antennas/TransientGeoRadar.aedt .`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to remove previous output files for an AnsysEDT simulation?",
    "answer": "Previous output files can be removed using `rm -rf $YOUR_AEDT_FILE.* ${YOUR_AEDT_FILE}results`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the common locations for running Ansys programs interactively in graphical mode?",
    "answer": "Ansys programs can be run interactively in graphical mode on compute nodes of the clusters or on Graham's VDI nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum duration for running Ansys interactively on a single compute node?",
    "answer": "Ansys can be run interactively on a single compute node for up to 24 hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is running Ansys on a compute node ideal for intensive simulations?",
    "answer": "It is ideal for intensive simulations because all cores and memory can be requested using `salloc`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `salloc` command example for launching an interactive graphical session on a compute node?",
    "answer": "An example `salloc` command is `salloc --time=3:00:00 --nodes=1 --cores=8 --mem=16G --account=def-group`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which window manager command is suggested after launching an `salloc` session for graphical use?",

    "answer": "You launch AnsysEDT by simply typing `ansysedt` in the terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What initial configuration steps are recommended in AnsysEDT's graphical interface regarding HPC and Analysis Options?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to click `Tools -> Options -> HPC and Analysis Options -> Edit`, uncheck 'Use Automatic Settings' (once only), and not modify Cores under the Machines tab (as it's detected by Slurm)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch an interactive analysis within AnsysEDT's graphical interface?",
    "answer": "To launch an interactive analysis, click on `Project -> Analyze All`."
