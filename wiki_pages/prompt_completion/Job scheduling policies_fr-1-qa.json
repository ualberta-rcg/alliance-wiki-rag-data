  {
    "question": "What is a basic way to accomplish work on clusters?",
    "answer": "By submitting tasks that only specify the number of cores required and the maximum execution time."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it beneficial to have a good understanding of the scheduling policy?",
    "answer": "You will gain productivity when submitting multiple tasks or tasks that require a large amount of resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the priority of tasks determined?",
    "answer": "Tasks are processed in order of priority determined by the Fair Tree algorithm."
  },
  {
    "question": "What algorithm determines task priority?",
    "answer": "The Fair Tree algorithm."
  },
  {
    "question": "To what is each task billed?",
    "answer": "Each task is billed to a resource allocation project."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the project for a task defined?",
    "answer": "The project for a task is defined by the `--account` argument passed to `sbatch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do account codes typically start with for projects that received CPU or GPU time through a resource allocation competition?",
    "answer": "For projects that received CPU or GPU time through a resource allocation competition, the account code generally starts with `rrg-` or `rpp-`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do account names typically start with for projects using the rapid access service?",
    "answer": "For projects using the rapid access service, the account name generally starts with `def-`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find information on which account code to use?",
    "answer": "Users can consult the 'Comptes et projets' section of the 'Running jobs/fr' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is assigned to each project?",
    "answer": "Each project is assigned a 'target usage level' (cible d'utilisation)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the target usage level determined for projects with resources allocated via the competition?",
    "answer": "For projects with resources allocated via the competition, the target usage level depends on the quantity of CPU-years or GPU-years that has been allocated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the target usage level for projects without allocated resources?",
    "answer": "Projects without allocated resources (i.e., `def-` accounts) all have the same target usage level, which is adjusted every few minutes based on the number of active projects in the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to view usage and sharing information?",
    "answer": "The `sshare` command can be used to view usage and sharing information."
  },
  {
    "question": "What suffix must be added to the account code when using the `sshare` command?",
    "answer": "`_cpu` or `_gpu` must be added to the end of the account code because both are accounted for individually."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the first red line in the `sshare` output represent?",
    "answer": "The first red line in the `sshare` output describes the status of the project relative to other projects using the cluster and is the most important for scheduling."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a high 'LevelFS' value indicate for a group?",
    "answer": "A high 'LevelFS' value indicates that the group has used only a small portion of its allocated resources, suggesting that tasks submitted by this group will likely have a rather high priority."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the other lines in the `sshare` table show (below the first project line)?",
    "answer": "The other lines in the table show the values for each user relative to other users within the same project."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the priority level for tasks of a group relative to other research groups determined?",
    "answer": "The priority level for tasks of a group relative to other research groups is solely determined by the 'LevelFS' value for the group, not by the 'LevelFS' values of the individual users within that group."
