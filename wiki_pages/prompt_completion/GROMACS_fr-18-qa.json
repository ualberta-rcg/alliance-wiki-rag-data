    "question": "How do I install gmx_MMPBSA for gromacs/2021 using StdEnv/2020?",
    "answer": "First, load the necessary modules and create a virtual environment, then install required Python packages, and finally load the Qt/PyQt module. The commands are: `module purge`, `module load StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 python/3.8 gromacs/2021.4`, `module load ambertools/21`, `virtualenv venv_gmxMMPBSA`, `source venv_gmxMMPBSA/bin/activate`, `pip install -U pip`, `pip install --no-index numpy==1.22.2 seaborn==0.13.1 gmx_MMPBSA==1.5.0.3 ParmEd==3.4.4`, and `module load qt/5.15.2`."
