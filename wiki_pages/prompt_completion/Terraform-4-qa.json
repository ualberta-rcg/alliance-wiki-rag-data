    "question": "What are the essential details required to define an OpenStack VM named 'myvm' using Terraform, including its network configuration?",
    "answer": "A minimal OpenStack VM definition in Terraform includes its `name` (e.g., 'myvm'), `image_id` (e.g., '80ceebef-f9aa-462e-a793-d3c1cf96123b'), `flavor_id` (e.g., '0351ddb0-00d0-4269-80d3-913029d1a111'), `key_pair` (e.g., 'Aluminum'), `security_groups` (e.g., 'default'), and a `network` sub-block specifying the network `name` (e.g., 'my-tenant-net')."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Terraform command is used to implement the changes defined in the configuration, such as creating a VM?",
    "answer": "The `terraform apply` command is used to actually effect the changes described in the plan."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Terraform indicate the successful creation of an OpenStack instance?",
    "answer": "Terraform indicates success with a message like 'Creation complete after 32s [id=1f7f73ff-b9b5-40ad-9ddf-d848efe13e42]' and a summary 'Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.'"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the name of the file created by Terraform that stores details about managed resources?",
    "answer": "There is a file in your workspace called `terraform.tfstate`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `terraform.tfstate` file?",
    "answer": "The state file contains details about the managed resources Terraform uses to determine how to arrive at a new state described by configuration updates."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the `terraform.tfstate` file is deleted?",
    "answer": "Without the `terraform.tfstate` file, Terraform cannot properly manage resources and if you delete it, you will need to restore it or recreate it, or manage those resources without Terraform."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why would a newly created VM on a private network not be directly accessible from outside the tenant?",
    "answer": "A newly created VM on a private network cannot be logged in or checked out because a floating IP has not been assigned to it, making it not directly accessible from outside the tenant."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a jump host (or bastion host) and when is it a useful strategy?",
    "answer": "A jump host is another host in the same tenant with a floating IP that can be used to access VMs on the private network. This is a good strategy for nodes that do not need to be directly accessible from the internet, such as a database server, or to preserve floating IPs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What OpenStack CLI command can you use to verify that a VM has been created and is active?",
    "answer": "You can use the `openstack server list` command in your OpenStack terminal window to see your new VM and its status."
