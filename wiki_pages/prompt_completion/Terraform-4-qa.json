    "question": "How do you define a basic OpenStack VM in Terraform?",
    "answer": "A basic OpenStack VM is defined using a `resource \"openstack_compute_instance_v2\"` block, specifying attributes like `name`, `image_id`, `flavor_id`, `key_pair`, `security_groups`, and a `network` sub-block."
  },
  {
    "question": "What attributes were configured for the `myvm` instance in the provided Terraform example?",
    "answer": "The `myvm` instance was configured with `name = \"myvm\"`, `image_id = \"80ceebef-f9aa-462e-a793-d3c1cf96123b\"`, `flavor_id = \"0351ddb0-00d0-4269-80d3-913029d1a111\"`, `key_pair = \"Aluminum\"`, `security_groups = [\"default\"],` and connected to the `my-tenant-net` network."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which command is used to apply Terraform configurations and create resources?",
    "answer": "The `terraform apply` command is used to apply the configuration and create resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long did it take for the `myvm` instance creation to complete in the example `terraform apply` output?",
    "answer": "The `myvm` instance creation was completed after 32 seconds."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ID of the `myvm` instance that was successfully created in the example?",
    "answer": "The ID of the `myvm` instance is `1f7f73ff-b9b5-40ad-9ddf-d848efe13e42`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you verify that a VM created by Terraform is active in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "You can verify the VM's status on Horizon or by using the OpenStack CLI command `server list -c ID -c Name -c Status`, which will show the new VM with an `ACTIVE` status."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `terraform.tfstate` file, and what is its purpose?",
    "answer": "The `terraform.tfstate` file is created by Terraform during configuration application. It contains details about the managed resources that Terraform uses to determine how to arrive at a new state based on configuration updates."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the consequences of deleting the `terraform.tfstate` file?",
    "answer": "If the `terraform.tfstate` file is deleted, Terraform cannot properly manage resources. You would need to restore it, recreate it, or manage those resources without Terraform."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does Terraform manage or affect OpenStack resources that were created manually or outside of its configuration?",
    "answer": "No, Terraform does not manage or affect resources already defined in the project that were not configured by Terraform. It has no knowledge of their existing state and they are invisible to Terraform."
