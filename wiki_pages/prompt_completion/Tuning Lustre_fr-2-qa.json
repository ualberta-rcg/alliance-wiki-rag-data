    "question": "After migrating a file with `lfs migrate -c 2`, what will be the `lmm_stripe_count` for that file?",
    "answer": "The `lmm_stripe_count` will be 2, and two objects will be allocated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of increasing the number of disks for a file in Lustre?",
    "answer": "Increasing the number of disks can increase performance, but it also makes the file more vulnerable to hardware failures."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should small files, specifically those less than 1MB like configuration files, be handled in a parallel program for optimal efficiency?",
    "answer": "For small files (< 1MB), it is more efficient to place them on a single disk (stripe count=1), read them with the master process, and then send them to other processes using `MPI_Broadcast` or `MPI_Scatter`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended stripe count for small files in a parallel computing environment using Lustre?",
    "answer": "A `stripe count` of 1 is recommended for small files in Lustre, meaning they should be placed on a single disk."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which MPI functions are suggested for distributing a small file from a master process to other processes?",
    "answer": "`MPI_Broadcast` or `MPI_Scatter` are suggested for distributing a small file from a master process to other processes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the best practice for `stripe count` when handling large data files with MPI processes?",
    "answer": "When manipulating large data files, it is preferable to use as many disks as the number of MPI processes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the `stripe_size` be determined for large data files, and what is a general recommendation if unsure?",
    "answer": "The `stripe_size` should usually match the size of the data buffer read or written by each process (e.g., 1MB if processes read 1MB). If there is no specific reason to change it, it's recommended to leave it at its default value, which is optimized for large files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a crucial requirement for the `stripe_size` parameter?",
    "answer": "The `stripe_size` must always be an integer multiple of 1MB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What general advice is provided regarding file open and close operations for better performance?",
    "answer": "It is generally recommended to minimize file open and close operations as much as possible, ideally opening a file only once at the beginning of execution and closing it at the end."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it more efficient to write many small files or aggregate data into a single large file?",
    "answer": "It is preferable to aggregate all data into a single file rather than writing a multitude of small files to reduce overhead."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find additional information about archiving and compressing files?",
    "answer": "Additional information about archiving and compressing files can be found under 'Archivage et compression de fichiers'."
