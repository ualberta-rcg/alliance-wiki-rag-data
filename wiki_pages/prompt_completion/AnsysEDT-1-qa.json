  {
    "question": "How can users obtain a license for AnsysEDT if The Alliance doesn't provide a generic one?",
    "answer": "Many institutions, faculties, and departments already have license servers that can be used if legal aspects are resolved and network changes are made to enable access from cluster compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to enable an external license server to be reached from cluster compute nodes for AnsysEDT?",
    "answer": "Network changes would need to be made to enable the license server to be reached from the cluster compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can the Ansys software check out licenses after a license server is accessible?",
    "answer": "The Ansys software would be able to check out licenses after loading the ansysedt module."

    "answer": "For help, contact technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify your AnsysEDT license server?",
    "answer": "Specify your ansysedt license server by creating a file named `$HOME/.licenses/ansys.lic` consisting of two lines."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can more details about configuring the Ansys license file be found?",
    "answer": "Further details can be found on the Ansys wiki page under the 'Configuring your license file' section."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can AnsysEDT be run interactively in batch (non-GUI) mode?",
    "answer": "It can be run by first starting an `salloc` session with specific options (e.g., `--time=3:00:00 --tasks=8 --mem=16G --account=def-account`) and then copy-pasting the `ansysedt` command from the last line of `script-local-cmd.sh`, manually specifying `$YOUR_AEDT_FILE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are AnsysEDT jobs submitted to a cluster queue using Slurm?",
    "answer": "Jobs may be submitted to a cluster queue with the `sbatch script-name.sh` command using single node scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which cluster were the AnsysEDT Slurm scripts tested as of January 2023?",
    "answer": "As of January 2023, the scripts had only been tested on Graham."
  },
  {
    "question": "What parameters need to be specified in the Slurm scripts before running AnsysEDT jobs?",
    "answer": "Before using them, specify the simulation time, memory, number of cores, and replace `YOUR_AEDT_FILE` with your input file name."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users obtain a full listing of AnsysEDT command line options?",
    "answer": "A full listing of command line options can be obtained by starting AnsysEDT in graphical mode with `ansysedt -help` or `ansysedt -Batchoptionhelp` to get scrollable graphical popups."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical module load sequence for AnsysEDT in a Slurm script like `script-local-cmd.sh`?",
    "answer": "The typical module load sequence involves loading `StdEnv/2023` and then `ansysedt/2023R2` (or a newer version)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the line `cp -f $EBROOTANSYSEDT/AnsysEM21.2/Linux64/Examples/HFSS/Antennas/TransientGeoRadar.aedt .` in the example script?",
    "answer": "This line is used to copy a test example file, `TransientGeoRadar.aedt`, to the current directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the input file for an AnsysEDT simulation specified within the `script-local-cmd.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The input file is specified by setting the `YOUR_AEDT_FILE` variable, for example: `YOUR_AEDT_FILE=\"TransientGeoRadar.aedt\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to clean up previous output files in the `script-local-cmd.sh` script?",
