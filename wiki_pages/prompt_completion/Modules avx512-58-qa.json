    "answer": "lammps-omp is a chemistry (chem) software."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is LAMMPS and what can it model?",
    "answer": "LAMMPS, or Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator, is a classical molecular dynamics code capable of modeling atoms and parallel particle simulations at atomic, meso, or continuum scales, including solid-state materials, soft matter, and coarse-grained systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does LAMMPS-OMP utilize parallel computing resources?",
    "answer": "LAMMPS-OMP runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'last' module?",
    "answer": "The 'last' module, or LAST, is used to find and align related regions of sequences."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of the 'last' module are available?",
    "answer": "Versions 1145 and 1642 of the 'last' module are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is LASTZ and what kind of sequences can it align?",
    "answer": "LASTZ is a program for aligning DNA sequences, specifically a pairwise aligner, useful for sequences the size of human chromosomes, from different species, and also for sequences produced by NGS technologies like Roche 454."
