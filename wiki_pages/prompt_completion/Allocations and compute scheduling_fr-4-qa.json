    "question": "How does the scheduler calculate priority for a task requesting 2 cores and 5GB of memory per core?",
    "answer": "For a task requesting 2 cores and 5GB per core, totaling 10GB of memory, the scheduler evaluates the demand as 2.5 core-equivalents for priority calculation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary difference in calculating GPU resource usage compared to CPU core-equivalents?",
    "answer": "GPU resource usage follows similar principles to core-equivalents, but a Reference GPU Unit (UGR) is added to the bundle, and the accounting for GPU allocation must include the UGR."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a point system for UGR-equivalents?",
    "answer": "Yes, a point system is used for UGR-equivalents, similar to the one for core-equivalents."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the priority calculation determined for tasks involving UGRs?",
    "answer": "The priority calculation is based on the maximum number of UGR-core-memory bundles requested."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example of what constitutes a UGR bundle?",
    "answer": "An example UGR bundle consists of 1 UGR, 3 cores, and 4GB of memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what conditions are UGRs specifically accounted for in the priority calculation for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "UGRs are accounted if a group uses more UGRs than cores OR memory per bundle. For instance, if a user requests 2 GPUs (each 1 UGR), 3 cores, and 4GB of memory, the scheduler evaluates the demand as 2 UGR-equivalents."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are cores counted in the priority calculation for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "Cores are counted if a group uses more cores than UGRs OR more memory per bundle with a GPU. For example, if a task requests 1 GPU (1 UGR), 5 cores, and 5GB of memory, the scheduler evaluates the demand as 1.66 UGR-equivalents due to the core requirement."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is memory accounted for in the priority calculation for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "Memory is accounted if a group uses more memory than UGRs OR cores per bundle with a GPU. For instance, if a task requests 1 GPU (1 UGR), 2 cores, and 6GB of memory, the scheduler evaluates the demand as 1.5 UGR-equivalents due to the memory requirement."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the UGR-equivalent value for a bundle containing a V100-32gb GPU, 7.8 cores, and 10.4GB of RAM on a hypothetical cluster?",
    "answer": "On a hypothetical cluster, such a bundle would be worth 2.6 UGR-equivalents."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the UGR-equivalent value for a bundle containing an A100-40gb GPU, 12 cores, and 16GB of RAM on a hypothetical cluster?",
    "answer": "On a hypothetical cluster, such a bundle would be worth 4.0 UGR-equivalents."
