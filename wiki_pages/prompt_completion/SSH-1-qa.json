    "question": "What is Secure Shell (SSH) and what is its primary function?",
    "answer": "Secure Shell (SSH) is a widely used standard for securely connecting to remote machines. It encrypts the connection, including usernames and passwords, and is used for executing commands, submitting jobs, checking job progress, and transferring files."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which SSH client is most commonly used on macOS and Linux?",
    "answer": "On macOS and Linux, the most widely used client is OpenSSH, which is a command-line application installed by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users access SSH on recent versions of Windows?",
    "answer": "For recent versions of Windows, SSH is available in the PowerShell terminal, the `cmd` prompt, or through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Additionally, popular 3rd-party SSH clients like PuTTY, MobaXTerm, WinSCP, and Bitvise are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What four pieces of information are essential for successful SSH access?",
    "answer": "To use SSH successfully, you must know the name of the machine you want to connect to (e.g., `fir.alliancecan.ca`), your username (e.g., `ansmith`, not a CCI, CCRI, or email), your password or an SSH key, and be registered for multifactor authentication with your 2nd factor available."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is a CCI, CCRI, or email address considered a valid SSH username?",
    "answer": "No, your SSH username is not your CCI (e.g., `abc-123`), nor a CCRI (e.g., `abc-123-01`), nor your email address. It is typically something like `ansmith`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended for better security when authenticating with SSH, a password or an SSH key?",
    "answer": "It is highly recommended to register and use an SSH key instead of a password, as it provides better security."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find their password for SSH login?",
    "answer": "Your SSH password is the same one you use to log in to CCDB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the basic command-line syntax for connecting via SSH?",
    "answer": "From a command-line client, use the `ssh` command like this: `ssh username@machine_name`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens the first time you connect to a machine via SSH regarding its host key?",
    "answer": "The first time you connect to a machine, you'll be asked to store a copy of its host key, which is a unique identifier. This allows the SSH client to verify, on subsequent connections, that it is connecting to the same machine."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find documentation on generating SSH key pairs?",
    "answer": "More information on generating key pairs can be found under 'SSH Keys', with specific guides for 'Generating SSH keys in Windows' and 'Using SSH keys in Linux'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can SSH be used to facilitate communication between compute nodes and the internet?",
    "answer": "Information on how to use SSH to allow communication between compute nodes and the internet can be found under 'SSH tunnelling'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a way to simplify the SSH login procedure?",
    "answer": "Yes, information on how to use an SSH configuration file to simplify the login procedure is available under 'SSH configuration file'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is X11 in the context of SSH, and what does it allow?",
    "answer": "X11 (or the X protocol) is a feature supported by SSH that allows for the use of graphical applications remotely."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required on your local computer to use X11 with SSH?",
    "answer": "In order to use X11, you must have an X11 server installed on your computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which X11 servers are recommended for macOS and Windows users?",
    "answer": "For macOS users, an external package like XQuartz is typically needed. Under Windows, MobaXterm comes with an X11 server, while PuTTY users can use VcXsrv."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you enable X11 communications using the SSH command line?",
    "answer": "To enable X11 communications using the SSH command line, add the `-Y` option to the command: `ssh -Y username@machine_name`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some common connection error messages that might occur when connecting to a cluster via SSH?",
    "answer": "Common connection error messages include 'no matching cipher found,' 'no matching MAC found,' 'unable to negotiate a key exchange method,' 'couldn't agree a key exchange algorithm,' and 'remote host identification has changed.'"
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do if you encounter a 'remote host identification has changed' error message?",
    "answer": "If you get a 'remote host identification has changed' error, verify that the host key fingerprint in the message matches one published at 'SSH host keys'. If it matches, it's safe to continue. If not, terminate the connection and contact support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of SSH connection error messages indicate a need to upgrade your OS or SSH client?",
    "answer": "If you see error messages like 'no matching cipher found,' 'no matching MAC found,' 'unable to negotiate a key exchange method,' or 'couldn't agree a key exchange algorithm,' you will need to upgrade your OS and/or SSH client to support stronger ciphers, key exchange protocols, and MAC algorithms."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which specific versions of SSH clients are known to fail and require an upgrade?",
    "answer": "Known versions that will fail and need to be upgraded include OpenSSH on CentOS/RHEL 5 and PuTTY v0.64 and earlier on Windows."

  },
  {
    "question": "When were further SSH security improvements made across all clusters?",
    "answer": "Further security upgrades of this type were made on all clusters in September/October 2019."
