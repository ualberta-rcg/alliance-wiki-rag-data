  },
  {
    "question": "How can users access SSH on Windows?",
    "answer": "For recent versions of Windows, SSH is available in the PowerShell terminal, in the `cmd` prompt, or through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Additionally, third-party clients like PuTTY, MobaXterm, WinSCP, and Bitvise are popular."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is essential for a successful SSH connection?",
    "answer": "To connect successfully via SSH, you must know the machine's name, your username, your password (or have an SSH key), and be registered for multifactor authentication with your 2nd factor available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What format should an SSH username follow?",
    "answer": "Your SSH username should typically be something like `ansmith`, not your CCI (e.g., `abc-123`), CCRI (e.g., `abc-123-01`), or email address."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an alternative to using a password for SSH and why is it recommended?",
    "answer": "You can use an SSH key instead of a password, which is highly recommended for better security."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the basic command-line syntax for connecting via SSH?",
    "answer": "From a command-line client, use the `ssh` command as follows: `ssh username@machine_name`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What occurs the first time you connect to a new machine using SSH?",
    "answer": "The first time you connect to a machine, you will be asked to store a copy of its host key, a unique identifier that allows the SSH client to verify it's the same machine on subsequent connections."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does SSH support graphical applications, and if so, how?",
    "answer": "Yes, SSH supports graphical applications via the X protocol, usually called X11. To use it, you must have an X11 server installed on your computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What X11 server is typically used by macOS users for SSH graphical applications?",
    "answer": "macOS users typically need to install an external package such as XQuartz for an X11 server."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you enable X11 communications using the SSH command line?",
    "answer": "To enable X11 communications from the SSH command line, add the `-Y` option: `ssh -Y username@machine_name`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some common SSH connection error messages?",
    "answer": "Common SSH connection error messages include 'no matching cipher found', 'no matching MAC found', 'unable to negotiate a key exchange method', 'couldn't agree a key exchange algorithm', and 'remote host identification has changed'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do if you encounter the 'remote host identification has changed' SSH error?",
    "answer": "If you get the 'remote host identification has changed' error, verify that the host key fingerprint matches one of the published fingerprints at [[SSH host keys]]. If it matches, it's safe to continue; otherwise, terminate the connection and contact support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if you receive SSH errors like 'no matching cipher found'?",
    "answer": "If you receive errors such as 'no matching cipher found', you will need to upgrade your OS and/or SSH client to support stronger ciphers, key exchange protocols, and message authentication code (MAC) algorithms."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which specific older SSH client versions are known to cause connection errors?",
    "answer": "OpenSSH on CentOS/RHEL 5 and PuTTY v0.64 and earlier on Windows are known versions that will fail and require upgrading."
