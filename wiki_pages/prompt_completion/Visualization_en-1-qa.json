  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended options for remote visualization on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "For interactive rendering, client-server visualization on interactive or high-priority nodes is recommended, and for non-interactive visualization, off-screen batch jobs on regular compute nodes are recommended."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are considered less efficient options for remote visualization?",
    "answer": "X11-forwarding and VNC are considered less efficient options for remote visualization."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does client-server interactive visualization work?",
    "answer": "In client-server mode, all data is processed remotely on the cluster using either CPU or GPU rendering, while users interact with their visualization through a familiar GUI client on their local computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which visualization tools support client-server mode?",
    "answer": "ParaView and VisIt support the client-server mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should X11-forwarding be avoided for heavy graphics?",
    "answer": "X11-forwarding should be avoided for any heavy graphics as it requires many round trips and is much slower than VNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required on the local computer to use X11-forwarding?",
    "answer": "An X-server installed on your local computer is assumed for X11-forwarding."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to Cedar, Graham, or B\u00e9luga for X11-forwarding?",
    "answer": "Connect to the cluster with the -X/-Y flag for X11-forwarding via ssh."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you start a small graphical visualization like VMD on a login node using X11-forwarding on Cedar, Graham, or B\u00e9luga?",
    "answer": "Load the vmd module and then run `vmd` on the login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command requests interactive resources on a compute node for large visualizations with X11-forwarding on Cedar, Graham, or B\u00e9luga?",
    "answer": "`salloc --time=1:00:0 --ntasks=1 --mem=3500 --account=def-someprof --x11` can be used to request interactive resources on a compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start a graphical application inside an interactive job on Cedar, Graham, or B\u00e9luga?",
    "answer": "Once the job is running, load the relevant module (e.g., `module load vmd`) and then start the graphical application (e.g., `vmd`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might a user request a testing job on Niagara for visualization?",
    "answer": "Since runtime is limited on the login nodes, a testing job provides more time for exploring and visualizing data, along with access to 40 cores on each requested node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to perform an interactive visualization session on Niagara using X11-forwarding?",
    "answer": "The first step is to ssh into niagara.scinet.utoronto.ca with the `-X/-Y` flag for X11-forwarding."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request an interactive job on Niagara?",
    "answer": "Request an interactive job by running `debugjob`."
