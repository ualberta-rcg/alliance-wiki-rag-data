  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended remote visualization options on Alliance systems for interactive rendering?",
    "answer": "For interactive rendering on Alliance systems, client-server visualization on interactive or high-priority nodes is recommended."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for non-interactive visualization on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "For non-interactive visualization, off-screen batch jobs on regular compute nodes are recommended."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are considered less efficient options for remote GUI visualization on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "X11-forwarding and VNC are considered less efficient options for remote GUI visualization."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does client-server interactive visualization work on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "In client-server mode, all data processing (using CPU or GPU rendering) occurs remotely on the cluster, while the user interacts with the visualization through a GUI client on their local computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which visualization packages support client-server mode on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "ParaView and VisIt support the client-server visualization mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should X11-forwarding be avoided for heavy graphics?",
    "answer": "X11-forwarding should be avoided for heavy graphics because it requires many round trips and is significantly slower than VNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to a cluster using X11-forwarding?",
    "answer": "You can connect via ssh with the `-X` or `-Y` flag for X11-forwarding, assuming an X-server is installed on your local computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you start a small visualization application like VMD on a login node using X11-forwarding on Rorqual, Fir, Nibi, or Narval?",
    "answer": "After connecting with X11-forwarding, you can run `module load vmd` followed by `vmd` on the login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to request interactive resources on a compute node with X11-forwarding for large visualizations on Rorqual, Fir, Nibi, or Narval?",
    "answer": "You would use `salloc --time=1:00:0 --ntasks=1 --mem=3500 --account=def-someprof --x11` to request interactive resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "After requesting an interactive job with X11-forwarding, how do you launch a graphical application like VMD inside that job on Rorqual, Fir, Nibi, or Narval?",
    "answer": "Once the job is running, execute `module load vmd` and then `vmd` inside the job."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might you use a testing job for interactive visualization on Trillium?",
    "answer": "A testing job on Trillium is useful because runtime is limited on login nodes, and it provides more time for exploration and visualization, along with access to 40 cores on each requested node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial steps to perform an interactive visualization session on Trillium using X11-forwarding?",
    "answer": "First, ssh into trillium.alliancecan.ca with the `-X` or `-Y` flag for X11-forwarding. Then, request an interactive job using the `debugjob` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run an application for off-screen rendering using the CPU with Xvfb?",
    "answer": "To run an application for off-screen rendering using the CPU, use the command `xvfb-run <name-of-application>` in a job script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run an application for off-screen rendering using the GPU with Xvfb?",
    "answer": "To run an application for off-screen rendering using the GPU, use `xvfb-run vglrun -d egl <name-of-application>`, and you must also reserve one GPU with Slurm."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is Xvfb typically used for visualization?",
    "answer": "Xvfb is used when applications require graphical output but you don't actually need to see the display because the results are saved to a file, enabling off-screen rendering."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is GPU rendering always faster than CPU rendering for off-screen visualizations?",
    "answer": "No, GPU rendering may not necessarily be faster than CPU rendering, so it's important to benchmark before committing to using the GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is VNC recommended over X11-forwarding for starting graphical user interfaces like Matlab?",
    "answer": "VNC is recommended because X11-forwarding can lead to a very slow connection for GUIs, while VNC allows you to start and connect to a remote desktop more efficiently."
