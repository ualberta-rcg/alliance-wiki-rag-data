    "question": "How can you display only the CPU profiling results in PGPROF?",
    "answer": "You can use the `--cpu-profiling` option to show only the CPU results."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `--cpu-profiling-mode top-down` option do in PGPROF?",
    "answer": "This option makes PGPROF show the main subroutine at the top, followed by the functions it called below."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you use PGPROF to analyze CPU results in a top-down manner from a data file named 'a.prof'?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `pgprof --cpu-profiling-mode top-down -i a.prof`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `--cpu-profiling-mode bottom-up` option in PGPROF?",
    "answer": "This option helps find out what part of your application takes the longest time to run by orienting the call tree to show each function followed by functions that called it, working backwards to the main function."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you analyze CPU results in a bottom-up manner using PGPROF from a data file named 'a.prof'?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `pgprof --cpu-profiling-mode bottom-up -i a.prof`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can data collection and analysis be performed in the same session in PGPROF's graphical mode?",
    "answer": "Yes, in graphical mode, both data collection and analysis can usually be accomplished in the same session."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to analyze performance data collected in command-line mode using PGPROF's graphical mode?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to analyze data from a pre-saved performance data file (e.g., collected in command-line mode) in graphical mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should PGPROF's GUI be run on a compute node rather than a login node?",
    "answer": "Because PGPROF's GUI is based on Java, it should be executed on a compute node in an interactive session rather than on the login node, as the latter typically lacks sufficient memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start a new profiling session in PGPROF's graphical mode?",
    "answer": "To start a new session, open the 'File' menu and click on 'New Session'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps for data collection in PGPROF's graphical mode after starting a new session?",
    "answer": "After starting a new session, you need to select the executable file, add any appropriate arguments for profiling, then click 'Next', and finally 'Finish'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you view a top-down call tree in the CPU Details tab of PGPROF's graphical interface?",
    "answer": "In the 'CPU Details' tab, you click on the 'Show the top-down (callers first) call tree view' button."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the four main panes in PGPROF's graphical visualization window?",
    "answer": "The four panes are the timeline (upper right), GPU Details, CPU Details, and Properties."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can you find performance details for GPU kernels in PGPROF's graphical interface?",
    "answer": "Performance details for GPU kernels are shown in the 'GPU Details' pane."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is displayed in the 'Properties' pane of PGPROF's graphical interface?",
    "answer": "The 'Properties' pane shows all the details for a function that is selected in the timeline window."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which company is responsible for PGPROF?",
    "answer": "PGPROF is a product of PGI, which is a subsidiary of NVIDIA Corporation."
