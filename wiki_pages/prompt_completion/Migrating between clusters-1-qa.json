    "question": "What is the purpose of this document regarding clusters?",
    "answer": "This page explains what is the same between clusters and what changes you'll need to adapt to on a new cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended method for transferring data between clusters?",
    "answer": "We recommend the use of Globus to transfer data from one cluster to another, particularly when the amount of data exceeds a few hundred megabytes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you access the clusters?",
    "answer": "Each cluster is accessible via SSH by changing the name of the cluster to the appropriate value."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are usernames and passwords consistent across all clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, your username and password are the same across all of the clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does accessing the Niagara cluster require any special steps?",
    "answer": "Yes, accessing Niagara does require a further step."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is data mirrored between clusters?",
    "answer": "No, there is no mirroring of data between the clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the contents of home, scratch, and project spaces shared between clusters?",
    "answer": "No, the contents of your home, scratch and project spaces are independent on each cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can filesystem quota policies differ between clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, the quota policies may differ between clusters, though generally not by much."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a group has a special storage allocation on one cluster, will it be available on others?",
    "answer": "No, if a group has a special storage allocation, for example `$HOME/projects/rrg-jsmith`, it will normally only be available on that particular cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are globally installed modules consistent across general purpose clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, the collection of globally installed modules is the same across all of our general purpose clusters, distributed using CVMFS."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to Python virtual environments or R and Perl packages when moving to a new cluster?",
    "answer": "Any Python virtual environments or R and Perl packages installed in your directories on one cluster will need to be re-installed on the new cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I modify my `$HOME/.bashrc` file on one cluster, will the changes apply to a new cluster automatically?",
    "answer": "No, if you modified your `$HOME/.bashrc` file on one cluster, you will need to modify the same file on the new cluster you're using."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do programs installed in your directories need to be re-installed on a new cluster?",
    "answer": "If you installed a particular program in your directories, this will also need to be re-installed on the new cluster since the filesystems are independent between clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What system is used for job submission across all clusters?",
    "answer": "All of our clusters use Slurm for job submission."
  },
  {
    "question": "What aspects of compute nodes can vary between clusters that might affect job submission scripts?",
    "answer": "The number of CPU cores per node or per GPU may vary significantly, and the amount of memory per node or per core also varies."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should users check for details about CPU cores or memory on a specific cluster's nodes?",
    "answer": "Users should check the page of the cluster they are using to verify how many cores can be used on a node and for memory details."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do compute nodes on all clusters have direct Internet access?",
    "answer": "No, on some clusters, compute nodes may not have direct Internet access."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find site-specific policies regarding compute nodes, such as Internet access?",
    "answer": "Users can access the cluster's link, from the sidebar on the left, to find out about site-specific policies."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are default compute allocations available on every cluster for a research group?",
    "answer": "Yes, each research group has access to a default allocation on every cluster, e.g., `#SBATCH --account=def-jsmith`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are special compute allocations, like RRG, available on all clusters?",
    "answer": "No, special compute allocations like RRG or contributed allocations are tied to a particular cluster and will not be available on other clusters."
