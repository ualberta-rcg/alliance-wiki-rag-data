  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of this document page regarding SSH connections?",
    "answer": "This page proposes a variety of techniques for keeping SSH terminal sessions alive for long periods, ranging from hours to days."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you prolong an SSH connection?",
    "answer": "One simple solution is to modify the configuration of your SSH client."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the SSH client configuration file located on MacOS and Linux?",
    "answer": "On MacOS and Linux, the SSH client configuration is found in `$HOME/.ssh/config`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the SSH client configuration file located on Windows?",
    "answer": "On Windows, the SSH client configuration is located in `C:\\Users\\<username>\\.ssh\\config`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What lines should be added to the SSH client configuration file to keep the connection alive?",
    "answer": "You should add the lines `Host *\\n    ServerAliveInterval 240` to the SSH client configuration file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `ServerAliveInterval 240` do in the SSH configuration?",
    "answer": "It ensures the transmission of a sign-of-life signal over the SSH connection to any remote server every 240 seconds (four minutes)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of setting `ServerAliveInterval` in SSH?",
    "answer": "It helps to keep your SSH connection alive even if it is idle for several hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are `tmux` and `screen`?",
    "answer": "They are examples of a terminal multiplexer, a program which allows you to detach your terminal session entirely."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main advantage of using a terminal multiplexer like tmux or screen?",
    "answer": "With a terminal multiplexer, you can detach your session and it will keep running, allowing you to log out, turn off your computer, and reattach to your session later from where you left off."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the 'Login node dependency' for tmux or screen sessions?",
    "answer": "Each cluster has several login nodes, and your tmux or screen session is specific to a particular login node, meaning you must connect to the right login node to reattach."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to detached terminal sessions if a login node is rebooted?",
    "answer": "Login nodes may occasionally be rebooted, which will kill any detached terminal sessions on that node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is tmux software?",
    "answer": "Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows multiple virtual sessions in a single terminal session, enabling disconnection from an SSH session without interrupting its processes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start a tmux server?",
    "answer": "You start a tmux server by typing `tmux`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command disconnects you from a tmux server?",
    "answer": "To disconnect from a tmux server, use `Ctrl+B D`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you reconnect to an existing tmux server?",
    "answer": "You can reconnect to a tmux server using the command `tmux a`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the key combination to create a new window in tmux?",
    "answer": "To create a new window in tmux, use `Ctrl+B C`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you navigate to the next window in tmux?",
    "answer": "To go to the next window in tmux, use `Ctrl+B N`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you enable 'copy' mode in tmux?",
    "answer": "You enable 'copy' mode in tmux by pressing `Ctrl+B [`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What functionality does 'copy' mode provide in tmux?",
    "answer": "'Copy' mode allows you to scroll with the mouse and Page-Up/Page-Down within the terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you disable 'copy' mode in tmux?",
    "answer": "You disable 'copy' mode in tmux by pressing `Esc`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What error message might you get if you try to launch tmux inside a job submitted through tmux?",
    "answer": "You might get the `lost server` error message."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does the 'lost server' error occur when nesting tmux sessions?",
    "answer": "This happens because the `$TMUX` environment variable pointing to the tmux server is propagated to the job, and its value is not valid."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you reset the `$TMUX` environment variable?",
    "answer": "You can reset the `$TMUX` environment variable with `unset TMUX`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is nested use of tmux recommended?",
    "answer": "No, nested use of tmux is not recommended."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is nested use of tmux not recommended?",
    "answer": "Nested use of tmux is not recommended because sending commands to a nested tmux requires hitting `Ctrl+B` twice (e.g., `Ctrl+B Ctrl+B C` for a new window)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an alternative to nested tmux if you are using tmux on a login node?",
    "answer": "Consider using GNU Screen inside your job as an alternative to nested tmux."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is GNU Screen?",
    "answer": "GNU Screen is another widely used terminal multiplexer."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create a detached terminal session using GNU Screen?",
    "answer": "You create a detached terminal session using `screen -S <session name>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a good practice when naming GNU Screen sessions?",
    "answer": "It's a good idea to give a descriptive name to your terminal sessions to make them easier to identify later."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you list your detached terminal sessions in GNU Screen?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `screen -list` to see a list of your detached terminal sessions on the current node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you attach to an existing GNU Screen session?",
    "answer": "You can attach to one of your sessions using the command `screen -d -r <session name>`."
