  {
    "question": "What are the common SBATCH directives used in STAR-CCM+ job scripts for clusters like Fir, Rorqual, Nibi, Narval, and Trillium?",
    "answer": "Common SBATCH directives include `--account=def-group`, `--time=00-01:00`, `--nodes=1`, `--mem=0`, and `--ntasks-per-node=1`. The `--ntasks-per-node` value should not be changed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules should be loaded before running STAR-CCM+ jobs on these clusters?",
    "answer": "You should load `StdEnv/2023` and `starccm-mixed/20.04.007` (or `starccm/20.04.007-R8`). The Trillium cluster also requires `CCEnv`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify the input simulation file and an optional Java macro file in a STAR-CCM+ SLURM script?",
    "answer": "The input simulation file is specified by setting `SIM_FILE='mysample.sim'`, and an optional Java macro file can be included by uncommenting `JAVA_FILE='mymacros.java'` and providing the filename."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPUs per task are typically requested for STAR-CCM+ jobs on Fir/Rorqual/Nibi, Narval, and Trillium clusters?",
    "answer": "Fir/Rorqual/Nibi and Trillium typically request `--cpus-per-task=192`, while Narval requests `--cpus-per-task=64`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a Siemens Power on Demand (PoD) license configured and used within a STAR-CCM+ SLURM script?",
    "answer": "For a Siemens PoD license, the `LM_PROJECT` environment variable must be set to your CD-ADAPCO PROJECT ID (e.g., `LM_PROJECT='my22digitpodkey'`), and the `starccm+` command includes `-power -podkey $LM_PROJECT`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main difference in the `starccm+` command when using an institutional license server compared to a Siemens PoD license in a job script?",
    "answer": "When using an institutional license server, the `-power -podkey $LM_PROJECT` options are omitted from the `starccm+` command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which MPI implementation is used for STAR-CCM+ jobs on Fir/Rorqual/Nibi and Narval clusters?",
    "answer": "On Fir/Rorqual/Nibi clusters, the `intel -fabric psm2` MPI implementation is used. On Narval, `openmpi` is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What special steps are required for using a Siemens PoD license on the Trillium cluster, including any workarounds for license failures?",
    "answer": "On Trillium, you need to set `LM_PROJECT`, `FLEXPORT`, `VENDPORT`, and `LICSERVER` variables, export `CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE`, and use an `ssh nia-gw` command for license forwarding. There's also a workaround that retries starting `starccm+` up to 5 times if license failures occur."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial steps to configure an account for remote visualization with STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "You must create the license file `~/.licenses/starccm.lic`. If using a POD license, configure `export LM_PROJECT='CD-ADAPCO PROJECT ID'` and add `-power` to the command line options."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch STAR-CCM+ version 15.04.010 or newer for remote visualization on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "After connecting with TigerVNC, load `StdEnv/2020`, then `starccm-mixed/17.02.007` (or `starccm/16.04.007-R8`), and finally run `starccm+`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to start STAR-CCM+ versions 13.06.012 or older for remote visualization on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "For STAR-CCM+ versions 13.06.012 or older, load `StdEnv/2016`, then `module load starccm-mixed/13.06.012` (or `starccm/13.06.012-R8`), and run `starccm+ -mesa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you open a terminal on VDI nodes (gra-vdi) after connecting with TigerVNC to launch STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "Once the remote desktop is displayed, click on `Applications-->Systems Tools-->Mate Terminal` to open a terminal window."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the current limitation regarding OpenGL acceleration for STAR-CCM+ on gra-vdi nodes?",
    "answer": "Only the MESA implementation of OpenGL can currently be used on gra-vdi with STAR-CCM+ due to issues with VirtualGL, which typically provides local GPU acceleration for OpenGL graphics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the commands to launch STAR-CCM+ version 18.04.008 or newer for remote visualization on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load `CcEnv` and `StdEnv/2023`, then `starccm-mixed/18.04.008` (or `starccm/18.04.008-R8`), and run `starccm+ -rr server`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start STAR-CCM+ versions from 15.04.010 up to 18.02.008 on VDI nodes for remote visualization?",
    "answer": "Load `CcEnv` and `StdEnv/2020`, then `starccm-mixed/15.04.010` (or `starccm/15.04.010-R8`), and run `starccm+ -mesa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which commands are used to launch STAR-CCM+ version 13.06.012 or older on VDI nodes for remote visualization?",
    "answer": "Load `CcEnv` and `StdEnv/2016`, then `starccm-mixed/13.06.012` (or `starccm/13.06.012-R8`), and run `starccm+ -mesa`."
