  {
    "question": "What information is needed to set up an SSH tunnel for a commercially licensed program in a batch job?",
    "answer": "You will need the IP address or name of the license server (LICSERVER) and the port number of the license service (LICPORT)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one obtain the necessary information for the license server and port number?",

    "question": "What is an alternative solution for nibi if an SSH tunnel isn't used for license servers?",
    "answer": "For nibi, an alternative solution is to request a firewall exception for the license server (LICSERVER) and its specific port (LICPORT)."
  },

    "question": "What is the gateway server for Trillium?",
    "answer": "The gateway server (GATEWAY) on Trillium is tri-gw."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify the gateway server on nibi?",
    "answer": "On nibi, you would pick one of the login nodes (l1, l2, ... l5) as the gateway server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the basic SSH command to set up a tunnel for contacting a license server in a job script?",
    "answer": "The SSH command is: `ssh GATEWAY -L COMPUTEPORT:LICSERVER:LICPORT -N -f`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `-N` parameter do in the SSH command for setting up a tunnel?",
    "answer": "The `-N` parameter tells SSH not to open a shell on the GATEWAY."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the `-f` and `-N` parameters do together in the SSH command?",
    "answer": "The `-f` and `-N` parameters together tell SSH not to open a shell and to run in the background, allowing the job script to continue past the SSH command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should software be informed about the license server when using an SSH tunnel?",
    "answer": "The software should be told that the license server is on port COMPUTEPORT on the server `localhost`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the term 'localhost' refer to?",
    "answer": "The term `localhost` is the standard name by which a computer refers to itself."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example of setting an environment variable to inform software about the license server using an SSH tunnel?",
    "answer": "An example is `export MLM_LICENSE_FILE=COMPUTEPORT@localhost`."
