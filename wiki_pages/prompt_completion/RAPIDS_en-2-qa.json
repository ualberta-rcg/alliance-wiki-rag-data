    "question": "How do I request an interactive session on a GPU node for RAPIDS?",
    "answer": "You can request an interactive session using the command `salloc --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=10G --gpus-per-node=1 --time=1:0:0 --account=def-someuser`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to start the RAPIDS shell on a GPU node after an interactive session is granted?",
    "answer": "First, load the Apptainer module with `module load apptainer`, then start the RAPIDS shell with `apptainer shell --nv rapids.sif`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `--nv` option when starting the Apptainer shell?",
    "answer": "The `--nv` option binds the GPU driver on the host to the container, enabling access to the GPU device from inside the Apptainer container."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check if the GPU device is accessible from within the Apptainer container?",
    "answer": "After the shell prompt changes to `Apptainer>`, you can check GPU statistics by running `nvidia-smi`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch a Jupyter Notebook server within the RAPIDS environment inside an Apptainer container?",
    "answer": "From the `Apptainer>` prompt, launch the server using `jupyter-lab --ip $(hostname -f) --no-browser`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are packages handled in the RAPIDS v23.08 release within the container shell?",
    "answer": "Starting with the RAPIDS v23.08 release, all packages are included in the base conda environment, which is activated by default in the container shell."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if there is no direct Internet connection on a compute node when trying to connect to JupyterLab?",
    "answer": "You would need to set up an SSH tunnel with port forwarding between your local computer and the GPU node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a good practice for working with containers on a compute node regarding storage?",
    "answer": "It is a good practice to use the local disk on a compute node via `$SLURM_TMPDIR` when working with a container."
  },
  {
    "question": "What common SBATCH directives are typically included in a Slurm submission script for a RAPIDS job?",
    "answer": "Common SBATCH directives include `--gpus-per-node`, `--cpus-per-task`, `--mem`, `--time`, and `--account`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you copy necessary files like the container image, code, and data to the local disk within a Slurm job script?",
    "answer": "You can use `cp /path/to/rapids.sif ./`, `cp /path/to/your_rapids_code.py ./`, and `cp -r /path/to/your_datasets ./` to copy files to `$SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a Python RAPIDS script executed within an Apptainer container in a Slurm job script?",
    "answer": "The script is executed using `apptainer exec --nv rapids.sif python ./my_rapids_code.py`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should results from a RAPIDS job executed via Slurm be saved before the job terminates?",
    "answer": "Any results should be copied from the local disk to your `/project` directory, for example, `cp -r your_results ~/projects/def-someuser/username/`."
  },
  {
