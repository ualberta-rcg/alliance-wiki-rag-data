    "question": "How do you request an interactive session on a GPU node for RAPIDS?",
    "answer": "You can request an interactive session on a compute node with a single GPU using the `salloc` command, for example: `salloc --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=10G --gpus-per-node=1 --time=1:0:0 --account=def-someuser`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to start the RAPIDS shell on a GPU node after resources have been granted?",
    "answer": "Once the requested resource is granted, you first load the Apptainer module (`module load apptainer`), then start the RAPIDS shell with `apptainer shell --nv rapids.sif`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the `--nv` option when starting an Apptainer shell for RAPIDS?",
    "answer": "The `--nv` option binds the GPU driver on the host to the container, allowing the GPU device to be accessed from inside the Apptainer container."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you verify that the GPU device is accessible within the Apptainer container?",
    "answer": "After the shell prompt changes to `Apptainer>`, you can check the GPU stats in the container using the command `nvidia-smi`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to launch a Jupyter Notebook server in the RAPIDS environment from within the Apptainer shell?",
    "answer": "You can launch the Jupyter Notebook server using the command `jupyter-lab --ip $(hostname -f) --no-browser`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after the Jupyter Notebook server successfully starts?",
    "answer": "The URL of the Notebook server will be displayed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is important to know about the conda environment in RAPIDS v23.08 and later releases?",
    "answer": "Starting with the RAPIDS v23.08 release, all packages are included in the base conda environment, which is activated by default in the container shell."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if there is no direct Internet connection on a compute node when trying to access a Jupyter Notebook server?",
    "answer": "If there is no direct Internet connection on a compute node, you would need to set up an SSH tunnel with port forwarding between your local computer and the GPU node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a good practice when working with containers on a compute node for RAPIDS jobs?",
    "answer": "It is a good practice to use the local disk on a compute node when working via a container."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are RAPIDS jobs submitted to the Slurm scheduler?",
    "answer": "Once your RAPIDS code is ready, you write a job submission script to submit a job execution request to the Slurm scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended steps for handling container images, code, and data within a Slurm batch job submission script for RAPIDS?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to copy your container image, RAPIDS code, and data to the local disk on a compute node via `$SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Apptainer command is used to execute a Python script (e.g., `my_rapids_code.py`) within a RAPIDS container in a batch job?",
    "answer": "The command `apptainer exec --nv rapids.sif python ./my_rapids_code.py` is used to execute the Python script within the container."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done with any results generated by a RAPIDS job before it terminates?",
    "answer": "Any results should be saved to your `/project` directory, for example, `cp -r your_results ~/projects/def-someuser/username/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find comprehensive documentation for RAPIDS?",
    "answer": "Comprehensive documentation for RAPIDS, including how to stay connected and report issues, can be found at RAPIDS Docs ([https://docs.rapids.ai/])."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users access example notebooks to get started quickly with RAPIDS?",
    "answer": "A collection of example notebooks for getting started quickly with RAPIDS is available on GitHub at RAPIDS Notebooks ([https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks])."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find use cases and blogs related to RAPIDS applications?",
    "answer": "A collection of use cases and blogs for RAPIDS applications is available on Medium at RAPIDS on Medium ([https://medium.com/rapids-ai])."
