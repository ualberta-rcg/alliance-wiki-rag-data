    "question": "What factors should be considered when choosing a virtual machine backup strategy?",
    "answer": "The choice of backup and disaster recovery strategies will depend on your requirements and your particular use case."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is strongly encouraged regarding the location of virtual machine backups?",
    "answer": "Creating backups in locations outside the cloud is strongly encouraged."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 3-2-1 backup rule state?",
    "answer": "The 3-2-1 backup rule states that you should have three copies of your data stored on at least two different types of media and one of those copies should be offsite."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which tools can be used for file backups of data within a VM to remote locations?",
    "answer": "Tools such as rsync, duplicity, borg, or restic can be used to perform backups of the data within your VM to remote locations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some provisioning tools used for automating VM setup and configuration?",
    "answer": "Provisioning tools such as Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and SaltStack can be used to automate setup and configuration of software and operating systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do provisioning tools help with recreating a virtual machine?",
    "answer": "Recreating your virtual machine then becomes a trivial matter given the right specification files for a given provisioning tool."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can provisioning specification files be managed?",
    "answer": "These specification files can be managed with version control tools like Git."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the entire process of virtual machine creation and software configuration be automated?",
    "answer": "Provisioning tools can be combined with orchestration tools such as heat and terraform to automate the entire process of virtual machine creation and software configuration."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should data generated outside of setup automation be backed up?",
    "answer": "Any data which is generated or created outside this automation would then need to be backed up using file backup methods."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two different storage options available in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "OpenStack has two different storage options: Volumes, which are protected by 3 times replication, and ephemeral storage local to the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of protection does the 3 times replication of OpenStack Volumes provide?",
    "answer": "The 3 times replication of Volumes is to protect against hardware failure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What risks are not protected against by the 3 times replication of OpenStack Volumes?",
    "answer": "The 3 times replication of Volumes does not protect against accidental deletion or data loss from malicious intent."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics of data stored on node local ephemeral storage in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "Data stored on node local ephemeral storage can suffer data loss due to hardware failure and should not be relied upon for any critical data and is best suited to temporary or working data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tools does OpenStack provide for virtual machine backups?",
    "answer": "OpenStack provides tools to create disk images and snapshots of your virtual machines."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main VM flavors in OpenStack, and do they have the same backup procedures?",
    "answer": "The two main VM flavors are persistent (p) and compute (c), and they have different behaviors, so different procedures are recommended for backing up each flavor."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are Persistent VMs designed to boot?",
    "answer": "Persistent VMs are designed to boot from volumes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is not preserved when backing up a Persistent VM by copying its attached volumes?",
    "answer": "Copying the volume(s) would not preserve things like VM flavor, public IP, and security rules."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended method for creating a copy of a Persistent VM volume for backup purposes?",
    "answer": "The best way to create a copy of a volume for backup purposes is to create an image from that volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of creating an image from a volume for backup?",
    "answer": "An image can be downloaded and reused to create multiple new VMs, can be accessed by VirtualBox on your desktop or laptop, and uploaded to other clouds."
  },
  {
    "question": "What condition must be met to create an image from a volume?",
    "answer": "To be able to create an image from a volume, that volume must be detached from the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can a root volume of a VM be detached?",
    "answer": "If the volume is the root volume of the VM it cannot be detached unless the VM is deleted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What trick can be used to prevent a volume from being deleted when its associated VM is deleted, even if 'Delete Volume on Instance Delete' was checked?",
    "answer": "One trick is to create a snapshot of the volume, provided you have a storage quota which allows it, as volumes cannot be deleted if there is a volume snapshot created from them."
  },
  {
    "question": "What state must volumes be in before you can create images from them?",
    "answer": "All the volumes you wish to create images of should be in the 'Available' state."
  },
  {
    "question": "What disk format is recommended for creating an image from a volume in OpenStack and why?",
    "answer": "The 'QCOW2' disk format is recommended because it works well with OpenStack and typically does not take up as much space as 'Raw' images."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which disk image formats are useful when working with VirtualBox?",
    "answer": "Other formats 'vmdk' and 'vdi' can be useful when working with other virtualization tools such as VirtualBox."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you recreate a Persistent VM after creating images of its volumes?",
    "answer": "Once you have created images of all the volumes you wish to backup you can then re-create your VM booting from the original VM's root volume and attaching any additional volumes you may have had attached to the original VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do volume snapshots save?",
    "answer": "Volume snapshots save the state of a volume at the time the snapshot was created."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are volume snapshots ideal for backups, and why or why not?",
    "answer": "Volume snapshots are not ideal for backups because they depend on the original volume remaining intact and as such, cannot be downloaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can new volumes be created from volume snapshots?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can create a new volume from a snapshot of a volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two different meanings of 'snapshot' within OpenStack?",
    "answer": "OpenStack uses the word 'snapshot' to mean volume snapshots and snapshots of VMs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is created when you take a snapshot of a Persistent VM?",
    "answer": "If you have a persistent VM and create a snapshot of the VM, OpenStack creates a nearly empty image, which contains pointers to volume snapshots."
