    "question": "What does a 'Convergence failure -- run terminated' error indicate in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "It indicates that the SCF (self-consistent field) procedure has failed to converge."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you fix an SCF convergence failure in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You can try using a better guess for molecular orbitals (e.g., 'guess=read' with a lower level of theory like HF/STO-3G), use an alternate SCF converger like 'SCF=QC' or 'SCF=XQC', fix a poor initial geometry, or resubmit the job with an earlier geometry and a newly evaluated Hessian."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the error 'FOPT requested but NVar= XX while NDOF= YY' in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error occurs when you request a full optimization (FOpt) and the check on the number of variables (NVar) versus degrees of freedom (NDOF) indicates a mismatch."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you resolve the 'FOPT requested but NVar= XX while NDOF= YY' error?",
    "answer": "If NDOF is less than NVar, consider running the molecule with higher symmetry. If NVar is less than NDOF, the z-matrix likely has too many constraints. Bypassing the check with 'Opt' instead of 'FOpt' is possible but not recommended."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the reason for the error 'Unable to project read-in occupied orbitals'?",
    "answer": "This error occurs when reading a molecular-orbital guess from a checkpoint file, and the projection from the old to the new basis set fails. It can happen with pseudopotential basis sets like CEP-121G* if they are used with polarization functions that don't actually exist or use zero-exponent placeholders."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the solutions for the 'Unable to project read-in occupied orbitals' error?",
    "answer": "Avoid using CEP-121G* and instead use CEP-121G for the relevant elements, as they are often the same. Alternatively, a workaround is to not use the molecular-orbital guess."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the error 'KLT.ge.NIJTC in GetRSB' signify?",
    "answer": "This error indicates that an MP2 calculation has failed, possibly due to issues related to pseudopotential basis sets, similar to the 'Unable to project read-in occupied orbitals' error."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'KLT.ge.NIJTC in GetRSB' error be fixed?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, avoid using CEP-121G* and use CEP-121G for the elements in question, as they are identical for many elements."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the error 'Symbol XXX not found in Z-matrix' mean?",
    "answer": "This is an input error where a variable name typed into the input, such as 'H3NNN', is not present in the z-matrix."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you resolve the 'Symbol XXX not found in Z-matrix' error?",
    "answer": "You should either type the correct symbol for the variable or add the missing variable to the z-matrix as needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the cause of 'Variable X has invalid number of steps' error during a potential energy scan?",
    "answer": "This input error typically occurs during a generate rigid potential energy scan, most likely due to having two blank lines instead of one between the z-matrix and the variables section in the input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you fix the 'Variable X has invalid number of steps' error?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, delete the extra blank line in the input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can cause a 'Problem with the distance matrix' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error can be an input error, often occurring when two or more atoms are defined too close together. Rarely, it can be a program error if one of the distances is NaN, such as when optimizing diatomics starting with an excessively large distance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you resolve the 'Problem with the distance matrix' error?",
    "answer": "You need to examine the variables and the z-matrix for the atoms involved to ensure no atoms are too close. This can sometimes be caused by a missing minus sign in a torsion angle, leading to coincident atoms."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'End of file in ZSymb' error indicate in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This is an input error indicating Gaussian cannot find the z-matrix. This typically happens if a blank line is omitted at the end of the geometry specification or if 'geom=check' was forgotten when intending to read the z-matrix and parameters from a checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you fix the 'End of file in ZSymb' error?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, either add a blank line at the end of the geometry specification or include 'geom=check' in the route section if you intended to read from a checkpoint file."
