  {
    "question": "What is Julia designed for?",
    "answer": "Julia is a programming language designed for performance, ease of use, and portability."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is Julia available on the Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "Julia is available as a module on the Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are packages installed the first time in a Julia project?",
    "answer": "The first time a package is added to a Julia project (using Pkg.add or the package mode), it will be downloaded, installed in ~/.julia, and precompiled."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the same Julia package be used in multiple projects?",
    "answer": "Yes, the same package can be added to different projects, in which case the data in ~/.julia will be reused."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do different versions of the same Julia package coexist?",
    "answer": "Yes, different versions of the same package can be added to different projects and will coexist in ~/.julia."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Julia projects compare to Python virtual environments?",
    "answer": "Compared to Python, Julia projects replace 'virtual environments' while avoiding code duplication."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are binary dependencies handled in Julia packages from version 1.6 onwards?",
    "answer": "From Julia 1.6 onwards, Julia packages include their binary dependencies (such as libraries), so there is no need to load any software module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommendation for loading software modules with Julia 1.6 and later?",
    "answer": "From Julia 1.6 onwards, it is recommended not to load any software module because Julia packages include their binary dependencies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What issues might arise with Julia 1.5 and earlier regarding system-provided binaries on clusters?",
    "answer": "With Julia 1.5 and earlier, you may run into problems if a package depends on system-provided binaries because Julia's attempts to install such dependencies using yum or apt with sudo will not work on our clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should Julia's package manager find a system-provided HDF5 library for Julia 1.5 and earlier on clusters?",
    "answer": "For Julia 1.5 and earlier, you must provide extra information to allow Julia's package manager (Pkg) to find the HDF5 library by loading the appropriate module first and then using the environment variable defined by the module (e.g., HDF5_DIR) to extend Libdl.DL_LOAD_PATH."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide the command sequence for setting up JLD with a system-provided HDF5 library using Julia 1.4.1.",
    "answer": "```bash\n$ module load gcc/7.3.0 hdf5 julia/1.4.1\n$ julia\njulia> using Libdl\njulia> push!(Libdl.DL_LOAD_PATH, ENV[\"HDF5_DIR\"] * \"/lib\")\njulia> using Pkg\njulia> Pkg.add(\"JLD\")\njulia> using JLD\n```"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it best practice to extend `Libdl.DL_LOAD_PATH` with environment variables for system libraries on all Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "It's best practice because while it might work without it on systems like Graham (due to system-wide HDF5), it would fail on systems like Cedar. This method ensures uniform functionality on all systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Julia package has replaced JLD and why is it more portable?",
    "answer": "The JLD package has been superseded by JLD2, which is more portable because it no longer relies on a system-installed HDF5 library."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a known bug related to Julia package installation on the Narval cluster?",
    "answer": "On the Narval cluster, Julia sometimes crashes with a segmentation fault during the precompilation step when installing packages in /home directories, due to a bug in the filesystem software."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the temporary solution for installing Julia packages on Narval until the filesystem bug is resolved?",
    "answer": "Until the bug is resolved, you should use an alternate location, such as `/project`, for your Julia 'depot' on Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might installing Julia packages in your home directory cause issues?",
    "answer": "Installing Julia packages in your home directory can create large numbers of files, potentially causing you to exceed your home directory quota."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much space and how many files can `Gadfly.jl` create in `~/.julia`?",
    "answer": "Installing just the `Gadfly.jl` plotting package from an empty `~/.julia` directory can result in around 96MB and 37,000 files, which accounts for 7% of the total number of files allowed by a home directory quota."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users avoid exceeding their home directory quota when installing many Julia packages?",
    "answer": "To avoid exceeding the home directory quota, users can store their personal Julia 'depot' (containing packages, registries, precompiled files, etc.) in a different location, such as their project space."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user named 'alice' in project 'def-bob' change her Julia depot path?",
    "answer": "User `alice`, a member of the `def-bob` project, could add `export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=\"/project/def-bob/alice/julia:$JULIA_DEPOT_PATH\"` to her `~/.bashrc` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "If `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` is changed, will `~/.julia` still be used?",
    "answer": "Yes, even after changing `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH`, files in `~/.julia` will still be considered, and `~/.julia` will still be used for some files like command history."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if a user has an existing `~/.julia` depot when moving their depot to a new location?",
    "answer": "When moving your depot to a different location, it is better to remove your existing `~/.julia` depot first using `rm -rf $HOME/.julia` if you have one."
