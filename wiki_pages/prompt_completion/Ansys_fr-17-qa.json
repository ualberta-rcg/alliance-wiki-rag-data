    "question": "How do you resolve the \"Error segmentation violation - exiting after doing an emergency save\" message when launching icemcfd on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "To resolve this, select 'Settings Tab -> Display -> tick X11 -> Apply -> OK -> File -> Exit' once. The error should not occur on subsequent launches of icemcfd."

  {
    "question": "What is the procedure to start Ansys Mapdl in graphical mode on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load the modules `CcEnv` and `StdEnv/2023`, then `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions). You can then start the GUI directly with `mapdl -g`, or by running `unset SESSION_MANAGER; launcher` and clicking the 'RUN' button."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules should be loaded to run Workbench with local Ansys modules on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You should load `module load SnEnv` and then `module load ansys/2024R.04` (or older versions) for local Ansys modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules should be loaded to run Workbench with global Ansys modules on VDI nodes for newer versions?",
    "answer": "You should load `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and then `module load ansys/2025R1` (or newer versions). Note that ansys/2025R1 is not available on the SHARCNET license server before its update."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between `runwb2` and `runwb2-gui` commands for local Ansys Workbench modules on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "For local Ansys modules with `SnEnv`, `runwb2` uses the default SHARCNET license server. `runwb2-gui` will read your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file for a remote server, or offer an interactive option to use the CMC server."

    "question": "How can I prevent the \"Warning: Software rasterizer found, hardware acceleration will be disabled\" message when starting Fluent from Workbench with version 2025R1 on VDI?",
    "answer": "Before clicking 'Start' in the Fluent Launcher, go to the 'Environment' tab and copy/paste `HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` into the empty input field. Alternatively, define `export HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` in your environment before starting Workbench."

  {
    "question": "What are the recommended core and memory settings for running Mechanical in Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "When running Mechanical in Workbench on gra-vdi, ensure 'Distributed' is checked in the 'Solver' panel and specify a maximum of 24 cores. Do not use more than 128GB of memory."

  {
    "question": "What are the recommended core and memory settings for running Fluent in Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "When running Fluent on gra-vdi, do not check 'Distributed' and specify a maximum of 12 cores. Do not use more than 128GB of memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPU cores should be used for Ansys preprocessing or post-processing tasks on gra-vdi when no computation is being performed?",
    "answer": "Only 4 CPU cores should be used for these tasks to avoid unnecessarily extracting HPC licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if the Ansys Workbench GUI or its programs freeze or don't start correctly on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Open a new terminal window on gra-vdi and execute `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|fluent|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE|mono\"` to stop all Ansys processes. If problems persist and you previously used GUIs on compute nodes, try `rm -rf .ansys`."
