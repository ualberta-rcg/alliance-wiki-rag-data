    "question": "What does CPU stand for and what is its primary function?",
    "answer": "CPU stands for central processing unit, also commonly called processor. It is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is GPU computing used for?",
    "answer": "GPU computing uses a graphics processing unit (GPU) to accelerate deep learning, analytics, and engineering applications. GPU accelerators power energy-efficient data centres and play a huge role in accelerating applications in platforms from artificial intelligence to cars, drones, and robots."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a VCPU?",
    "answer": "VCPU stands for virtual central processing unit. One or more VCPUs are assigned to every Virtual Machine (VM) within a cloud environment, and each VCPU is seen as a single physical CPU core by the VM\u2019s operating system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a VGPU?",
    "answer": "VGPU stands for virtual graphics processing unit. One or more VGPUs can be assigned to Virtual Machines (VM) within a cloud environment, and each VGPU is seen as a single physical GPU device by the VM's operating system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Reference GPU Unit (RGU)?",
    "answer": "RGU is a unit measuring the amount of GPU resources that are used. It represents the \"cost\" of utilizing a particular GPU model, whose RGU value varies based on performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you give an example of RGU values for different GPU models?",
    "answer": "Yes, for example: 1 GPU A100-40GB = 4.0 RGU; 1 GPU V100-16GB = 2.2 RGU; 1 GPU P100-12GB = 1.0 RGU."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are allocations of storage space and cloud resources handled compared to CPU and GPU allocations?",
    "answer": "Allocations of storage space and cloud resources are handled differently from allocations of CPUs and GPUs. Storage and cloud resource allocations are maxima that cannot be exceeded, while CPU and GPU allocations are targets for average usage, translated into scheduling priorities."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does an allocation of N CPUs mean for a research group?",
    "answer": "An allocation of N CPUs means the group may expect to have access to N CPUs throughout the allocation period. Periods of greater usage may be possible if competing demand allows, but are not guaranteed; periods of lesser usage will not be compensated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a cluster in batch computing?",
    "answer": "A cluster is a group of interconnected compute nodes managed as a unit by a scheduling program."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a compute node?",
    "answer": "A compute node is a computational unit of a cluster, one or more of which can be allocated to a job. A node has its own operating system image, one or more CPU cores, and some memory (RAM), and can be used in either exclusive or shared manner by jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Core-year?",
    "answer": "Core-year is the equivalent of using 1 CPU core continuously for a full year. For instance, using 12 cores for a month, or 365 cores for a single day are both equivalent to 1 core-year."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are compute allocations based?",
    "answer": "Compute allocations are based on core-years allocations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a core-equivalent?",
    "answer": "A core-equivalent is a bundle made up of a single core and some amount of associated memory; it's a core plus the amount of memory considered to be associated with each core on a given system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a GPU-year?",
    "answer": "A GPU-year is the equivalent of using 1 GPU continuously for a full year or 12 GPUs for a month."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is an RGU-year value calculated?",
    "answer": "A value in RGU-years is calculated by multiplying GPU-years times the RGU of a given GPU model. For example, 10 GPU-years of an A100-40GB (which costs 4 RGU) equals 40 RGU-years."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Head or Login node?",
    "answer": "A Head or Login node is typically the launching point for jobs running on a cluster, configured to act as a middle point between the actual cluster and the outside network, and is usually the node users access when logging into a cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is batch processing priority generally allocated?",
    "answer": "Batch processing priority is generally allocated based on a fair-share algorithm, where each user is allocated a share of the total system resources, translating into priority access."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a user has recently used a large fraction of system resources under a fair share allocation?",
    "answer": "If a user has used a large fraction of the system recently (larger than their fair-share), their priority drops. However, the scheduling system gradually 'forgets' past overuse after some time of reduced usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the fair-share allocation system?",
    "answer": "The fair-share allocation system is designed to ensure full system usage and not to penalize users who take advantage of idle compute resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does a user's total allocation represent a strict limit on how many compute resources they can consume under a fair-share system?",
    "answer": "No, a user's total allocation is not a limit on how many compute resources they can consume. Rather, it represents what they should be able to get over the course of the year if they submit a constant workload to a fully busy system."
