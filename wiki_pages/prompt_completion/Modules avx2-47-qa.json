    "question": "What is GROMACS?",
    "answer": "GROMACS is a versatile software package designed to perform molecular dynamics simulations, specifically simulating the Newtonian equations of motion for systems containing hundreds to millions of particles. It is a GPU-enabled build and supports both MPI and threadMPI."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the available versions of the base GROMACS package?",
    "answer": "The available versions of the base GROMACS package include 2016.6, 2020.4, 2020.6, 2021.2, 2021.4, 2021.6, 2022.2, 2022.3, 2023, 2023.2, 2023.3, 2023.5, 2024.1, and 2024.4."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'gromacs-colvars' module?",
    "answer": "The 'gromacs-colvars' module is a version of GROMACS that has been patched with 'Colvars', a collective variables module used for molecular simulation programs. It is a GPU-enabled build and supports both MPI and threadMPI builds."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of 'gromacs-colvars' is available?",
    "answer": "Version 2020.6 of 'gromacs-colvars' is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the 'gromacs-cp2k' module used for?",
    "answer": "The 'gromacs-cp2k' module is a version of GROMACS compiled with CP2K for Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. Only 'gmx_mpi' and 'gmx_mpi_d' executables are available for this version."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of 'gromacs-cp2k' is mentioned in the document?",
    "answer": "The version 2022.2 of 'gromacs-cp2k' is mentioned."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is special about 'gromacs-ls'?",
    "answer": "GROMACS-LS is a modified version of GROMACS that enables the calculation of local stress fields from molecular dynamics simulations. It is a CPU-only build and does not support MPI, GPUs (CUDA), or hardware acceleration (SIMD), making it slower than unmodified GROMACS versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of 'gromacs-ls' is listed?",
    "answer": "Version 2016.3 of 'gromacs-ls' is listed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What functionality does 'gromacs-plumed' offer?",
    "answer": "The 'gromacs-plumed' version of GROMACS contains PLUMED patches to run metadynamics, a method for free energy calculations in molecular systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of 'gromacs-plumed' are available?",
    "answer": "Available versions of 'gromacs-plumed' include 2019.6, 2020.7, 2021.2, 2021.4, 2021.6, 2021.7, 2022.3, 2022.6, and 2023.5."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'gromacs-ramd' used for, and what are its features?",
    "answer": "GROMACS-RAMD is a modified version of GROMACS that supports Random Acceleration Molecular Dynamics (RAMD), used to identify ligand exit routes from buried binding pockets and investigate ligand dissociation mechanisms. It is a GPU-enabled build, containing both MPI and threadMPI binaries."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of 'gromacs-ramd' are available?",
    "answer": "Versions 2020.5-RAMD-2.0 and 2024.1-RAMD-2.1 of 'gromacs-ramd' are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of software are the GROMACS modules categorized as?",
    "answer": "All listed GROMACS modules ('gromacs', 'gromacs-colvars', 'gromacs-cp2k', 'gromacs-plumed', 'gromacs-ramd') are categorized as 'chem' (chemistry) software, except for 'gromacs-ls' which has no explicit type listed but its description indicates it's a GROMACS variant for molecular dynamics."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more documentation for GROMACS?",
    "answer": "Documentation for GROMACS can be found at [[GROMACS]]."
