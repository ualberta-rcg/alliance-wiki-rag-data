    "question": "What is a Resource Allocation Project (RAP) and how is it associated with a job in Slurm?",
    "answer": "A Resource Allocation Project (RAP) is associated with each job submitted to the Slurm job scheduler, and it is selected using the `--account` option with `sbatch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the scheduling priority of a job determined?",
    "answer": "The scheduling priority of a job is determined by the target share of its associated account relative to the account's recent usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does individual user activity within a research group affect job priority when sharing a RAP account?",
    "answer": "The usage of all users within a RAP is charged to a single account, meaning each user's activity affects the priority of jobs submitted by all other users in that group."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can active coordination among users improve a project's throughput within a RAP account?",
    "answer": "There are circumstances when active coordination among users may improve the project's throughput, especially when job priority is affected by shared account usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a user who has not used many resources submits a job to an account where other users have recently run a lot of work?",
    "answer": "The job may have very low priority, and all users of that account will have to wait for the account's fairshare (LevelFS) to return to a competitive value."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the fairshare principle apply within a group, and what priority do underserved users receive?",
    "answer": "The fairshare principle is applied both within and between groups. Jobs belonging to an underserved user will have the highest priority and, all else being equal, will run first when the group's fairshare recovers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what conditions might an underserved user's job not run first even after fairshare recovers?",
    "answer": "This may not happen if different users in the group have jobs with drastically different requirements, such as one user running many small jobs that fit into scheduling gaps (backfilling) while others have jobs with greater resource requirements."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some general strategies for managing computational usage within RAP accounts?",
    "answer": "Strategies include scheduling usage to prevent priority conflicts during critical deadlines, using different clusters, using multiple accounts (like a RAC award and a default account), and dividing work among separate Resource Allocation Projects for collaborative research groups."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can groups manage usage when users have distinct computational deadlines?",
    "answer": "It can be valuable to schedule their usage on the system so that they do not affect each others' priority at critical times when distinct deadlines require bursts of computation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does utilizing different clusters help in managing RAP account usage?",
    "answer": "Each RAP is independently accounted on each cluster, so a user's activity on one cluster will not affect the priority of jobs submitted by another user of the same account on a different cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a research group use multiple accounts to manage fairshare, and if so, how?",
    "answer": "Yes, a group with a RAC award can submit jobs to both the RAC account and the default account; jobs running under one account will not affect the fairshare of the other account."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a strategy for managing resource allocation during collaborations between different research groups?",
    "answer": "Each Principal Investigator (PI) involved in the research can obtain their own account, and the users' work can be divided appropriately among these separate Resource Allocation Projects."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a group do if the suggested strategies for managing usage within accounts are ineffective?",
    "answer": "If the strategies are ineffective, the group should contact an analyst for further assistance."
