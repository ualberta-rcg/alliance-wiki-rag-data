    "question": "What are the permissible uses of SIMULIA Academic Software with SHARCNET license tokens?",
    "answer": "The permitted uses are: 1) on SHARCNET hardware where the software is already installed, 2) in affiliation with a Canadian degree-granting academic institution, 3) for education, institutional or instruction purposes and not for any commercial or contract-related purposes where results are not publishable, and 4) for experimental, theoretical and/or digital research work, undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, up to the point of proof-of-concept in a laboratory."

    "question": "How should the Abaqus license file be configured for use on SHARCNET systems like Graham, gra-vdi, and Dusky?",

  {
    "question": "What should I check if my Abaqus job fails with a \"Segmentation fault\" related to `ABAQUS/eliT_CheckLicense`?",
    "answer": "If your Abaqus job fails with `[*** ABAQUS/eliT_CheckLicense rank 0 terminated by signal 11 (Segmentation fault)]`, you should verify if your `abaqus.lic` file contains `ABAQUSLM_LICENSE_FILE` to use abaqus/2020."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if my Abaqus job fails with a \"License server machine is down or not responding\" error?",
    "answer": "If your Abaqus job fails with an error message starting `[License server machine is down or not responding, etc.]`, you should verify if your `abaqus.lic` file contains `LM_LICENSE_FILE` to use abaqus/6.14.1."

  {
    "question": "How do I log in and load the necessary modules to query the SHARCNET Abaqus license server on Graham?",

    "question": "What command checks the SHARCNET license server for started and queued Abaqus jobs?",

  {
    "question": "What does it signify if the output of `abaqus licensing lmstat` shows a job as 'queued'?",
    "answer": "When `lmstat` indicates a job is 'queued', it means the job has entered the 'Running' state from Slurm's perspective (`squeue -j jobid` or `sacct -j jobid`) but is idle on a compute node, waiting for a license. This will consume CPU time and impact account priority as if it were computing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users prevent license shortage issues when submitting multiple Abaqus jobs with expensive tokens?",
    "answer": "To prevent license shortage issues, users should utilize job dependencies, job arrays, or configure Slurm email notifications to be alerted when a job completes before submitting another one."
