    "question": "How do you generate an APDL input file from an interactive Workbench Mechanical session?",
    "answer": "From within your interactive Workbench Mechanical session, click Solution -> Tools -> Write Input Files, then specify File name: YOURAPDLFILE.inp and Save as type: APDL Input Files (*.inp)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are APDL jobs submitted to the queue?",
    "answer": "APDL jobs can be submitted to the queue by running the `sbatch script-name.sh` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is Shared Memory Parallel (SMP) or Distributed Memory Parallel (DMP) configured for an Ansys Workbench job in a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The `MEMPAR` variable is set to `0` for SMP if `$SLURM_NNODES` is 1, otherwise it is set to `1` for DMP. This value is then used to modify the `SolveHandlers.xml` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to run an update on an Ansys Workbench project file in a batch script?",
    "answer": "The command `runwb2 -B -E \"Update()\" -F YOURPROJECT.wbpj` is used to run an update on an Ansys Workbench project file in batch mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical SBATCH parameters for a Shared Memory Parallel (SMP) CPU job in Ansys Mechanical?",
    "answer": "Typical SBATCH parameters include `--account=def-account`, `--time=00-03:00`, `--mem=32G`, `--nodes=1`, `--tasks=8`, and `--cpus-per-task=1`."

  {
    "question": "Which MPI implementation does Ansys Mechanical Distributed Memory Parallel (DMP) CPU jobs use on the Beluga cluster?",
    "answer": "On the Beluga cluster, Ansys Mechanical DMP CPU jobs use Intel MPI (`-mpi intelmpi`). On other clusters, Open MPI is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `mapdl` command is used for a Shared Memory Parallel (SMP) GPU job in Ansys Mechanical?",
    "answer": "The `mapdl` command for an SMP GPU job is `mapdl -smp -acc nvidia -na $SLURM_GPUS_ON_NODE -b nolist -np $SLURM_NTASKS -dir outdir-$SLURM_JOBID -i YOURAPDLFILE.inp`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variable is exported to print GPU device information for Ansys Mechanical GPU jobs?",
    "answer": "The environment variable `ANSGPU_PRINTDEVICES=1` is exported to print GPU device information."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is an output directory created for Ansys Mechanical jobs in the provided Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "An output directory is created using `mkdir outdir-$SLURM_JOBID`."
