    "answer": "Up to 70% of the node's RAM, which is 202GB, can be used as a local temporary file system via /dev/shm."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is /dev/shm useful for programs with high I/O operations?",
    "answer": "/dev/shm is useful for I/O-heavy programs because it's a RAMdisk, faster than real disk and burst buffer, and avoids bottlenecks with parallel file systems like GPFS by not synchronizing files over the network."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the $SLURM_TMPDIR environment variable?",
    "answer": "The $SLURM_TMPDIR environment variable is used for compute tasks and points to a RAMdisk, not local hard drives."

    "question": "What happens to the content of $SLURM_TMPDIR after a task completes?",
    "answer": "The content of the $SLURM_TMPDIR directory is deleted after the task is completed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does $SLURM_TMPDIR point to on Niagara's compute nodes?",
    "answer": "On Niagara's compute nodes, $SLURM_TMPDIR points to a ramdisk (in memory) because the compute nodes do not have local disks."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one use ramdisk for temporary files?",
    "answer": "To use ramdisk for temporary files, one can either access /dev/shm directly or use the environment variable $SLURM_TMPDIR."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is $BB_JOB_DIR?",
    "answer": "$BB_JOB_DIR is a temporary directory created on the burst buffer by the scheduler for every job on Niagara."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the content of $BB_JOB_DIR deleted?",
    "answer": "The content of the $BB_JOB_DIR directory is deleted after the job has finished."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is $BB_JOB_DIR accessible from?",
    "answer": "$BB_JOB_DIR is accessible from all nodes of a job."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what type of applications is $BB_JOB_DIR recommended?",
    "answer": "$BB_JOB_DIR is recommended for applications that generate many small temporary files or files that are frequently used (high IOPS) but cannot be stored on a virtual disk."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is ramdisk or burst buffer generally better for temporary files, and why?",
    "answer": "Ramdisk is generally better than burst buffer for temporary files because its bandwidth and IOPS are much greater."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the individual user quota for the $HOME file system?",
    "answer": "The individual user quota for the $HOME file system is 100GB."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is $HOME accessible on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "The $HOME file system is accessible on compute nodes in read-only mode."
  },
  {

  {
    "question": "When are users notified about files scheduled for deletion from /scratch?",
    "answer": "Users receive an email notification on the first of each month, and again around the 12th of each month, about files scheduled for deletion. They also get a shell notification upon logging into Niagara."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check if my files are scheduled for deletion from /scratch?",
    "answer": "You can check if your files are scheduled for deletion by using the command `ls -1 /scratch/t/todelete/current |grep your_userid` on a system that mounts /scratch, such as a SciNet login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to check disk usage on home, scratch, project, and archive filesystems?",
    "answer": "The `/scinet/niagara/bin/diskUsage` command, available on login nodes and datamovers, provides information on home, scratch, project, and archive filesystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I identify directories with more than 1000 files?",
    "answer": "You can identify directories with more than 1000 files using the command `/scinet/niagara/bin/topUserDirOver1000list`."

  },
  {
    "question": "If a file's access or modification time is updated after the purging list is generated, will it still be deleted?",
    "answer": "No, if a file's atime/ctime has been updated after the purging list generation but before the deletion date on the 15th, it will no longer be deleted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I get immediate feedback on a file's access/modification time to prevent purging?",
    "answer": "You can get immediate feedback on a file's access/modification time by using the `ls -lu` command to verify the ctime and `ls -lc` for the mtime."
