  },
  {
    "question": "How are resource requests for allocations scaled each year?",
    "answer": "Requests for allocations are scaled every year based on the overall score of the application and the supply and demand, due to limited resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two evaluation criteria for Resources for Research Groups (RRG) applications?",
    "answer": "RRG applications are evaluated against 'Research Methods' (70%) and 'Resource Management and Computational Expertise' (30%)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'Research Methods' criterion primarily evaluate for RRG applications?",
    "answer": "The 'Research Methods' criterion evaluates the methods proposed to achieve the objectives of the computational project and the appropriateness of the resources requested, focusing on 'what' research will be done and the technical justification provided."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is considered under 'Research Outline' for RRG evaluation?",
