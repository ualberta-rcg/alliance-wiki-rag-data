    "question": "How do you determine the memory required for Abaqus scripts that use multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "Memory estimations (per computation process) required to minimize I/O are provided in the `.dat` output file for completed tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the `mem-per-cpu` value calculated if `mp_host_split` is not specified or set to 1 for multi-node Abaqus scripts?",
    "answer": "The `mem-per-cpu` value can be determined approximately by multiplying the largest memory estimation by the number of nodes, then dividing by the number of `ntasks`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the `mem-per-cpu` value calculated if `mp_host_split` is specified and greater than 1 for multi-node Abaqus scripts?",
    "answer": "The `mem-per-cpu` value can be determined approximately from the largest memory estimation multiplied by the number of nodes, multiplied by the `mp_host_split` value, and then divided by the number of tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the constraint on the `mp_host_split` value in Abaqus multi-node scripts?",
    "answer": "The `mp_host_split` value must be less than or equal to the number of cores per node attributed at runtime; otherwise, Abaqus will stop."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors generally influence the maximum memory Abaqus can allocate?",
    "answer": "The maximum memory Abaqus can allocate generally depends on the `memory` parameter and the amount of physical memory available on the machine."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Abaqus memory limit impact scratch disk usage?",
    "answer": "If the upper memory limit is greater than the `MEMORY TO MINIMIZE I/O` value, actual memory usage will be close to `MEMORY TO MINIMIZE I/O`, and scratch disk usage will be near zero. Otherwise, actual memory used will be close to the memory limit, and scratch disk usage will be roughly proportional to the difference between the `MEMORY TO MINIMIZE I/O` estimate and the upper memory limit."

  {
    "question": "How can Abaqus be used in graphical mode?",
    "answer": "Abaqus can be used interactively in graphical mode on a cluster or on gra-vdi with VNC, or via the ondemand.sharcnet.ca system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to launch Abaqus CAE in graphical mode on a cluster?",
    "answer": "First, connect to a compute node using TigerVNC (maximum 3 hours). Then, open a terminal, load the modules `StdEnv/2020` and `abaqus/2021`, and finally launch the application with `abaqus cae -mesa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to launch Abaqus CAE in graphical mode on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Connect to a VDI node using TigerVNC (maximum 24 hours). Open a terminal, load one of the following module sets: `StdEnv/2016 abaqus/6.14.1`, `StdEnv/2016 abaqus/2020`, or `StdEnv/2020 abaqus/2021`, then start the application with `abaqus cae`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended alternative for graphical Abaqus as gra-vdi will be shut down?",
    "answer": "The new Ondemand system, accessible via `ondemand.sharcnet.ca`, is recommended instead of gra-vdi."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch Abaqus CAE through the Ondemand system?",
    "answer": "Connect to `ondemand.sharcnet.ca` from your laptop browser, open a new terminal window, enter `module load StdEnv/2020 abaqus/2021`, and then start the application with `abaqus cae`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Abaqus/2025 currently available?",
    "answer": "A module for `abaqus/2025` is in the process of being installed and will appear as an option once it's ready."
