    "question": "What is STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "STAR-CCM+ is a multidisciplinary engineering simulation suite."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of engineering phenomena can STAR-CCM+ model?",
    "answer": "It can model acoustics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, rheology, multiphase flows, particle flows, solid mechanics, reacting flows, electrochemistry, and electromagnetics."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who develops STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "STAR-CCM+ is developed by Siemens."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do users need their own license to use STAR-CCM+ on the servers?",
    "answer": "Yes, users will need to have their own license as the binaries are hosted but licenses are not provided."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can a remote POD license for STAR-CCM+ be purchased?",
    "answer": "A remote POD license can be purchased directly from Siemens."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two types of licenses that can be used for STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "A remote POD license purchased from Siemens or a local license hosted at your institution."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure an account to use a license server with the Star-CCM+ module?",
    "answer": "You need to create a license file named `$HOME/.licenses/starccm.lic` with a specific layout."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the general layout for the `starccm.lic` file?",
    "answer": "The general layout for the `starccm.lic` file is `SERVER <server> ANY <port>\\nUSE_SERVER`, where `<server>` is the hostname/IP and `<port>` is the static vendor port."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it necessary to manually set the `CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE` variable in a slurm script?",
    "answer": "No, manually setting `CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE` is not required; it is automatically set to your `$HOME/.licenses/starccm.lic` file when a Star-CCM+ module is loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific environment variable must be set for researchers with a POD license?",
    "answer": "Researchers with a POD license must manually set the `LM_PROJECT` environment variable equal to their CD-ADAPCO PROJECT ID in their slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file be configured for a POD license?",
    "answer": "For a POD license, the `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file should contain `SERVER flex.cd-adapco.com ANY 1999\\nUSE_SERVER`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required after creating the `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file if using an institutional license server for a cluster batch job?",
    "answer": "You must submit a problem ticket to technical support to help coordinate the necessary one-time network firewall changes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What troubleshooting step can be taken if STAR-CCM+ licensing problems persist?",
    "answer": "You can try removing or renaming the file `~/.flexlmrc` as it may store previous search paths and/or license server settings."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do temporary output files from STAR-CCM+ jobs accumulate?",
    "answer": "Temporary output files from STAR-CCM+ jobs may accumulate in hidden directories named `~/.star-version_number`, consuming valuable quota space."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can accumulated temporary STAR-CCM+ output files be removed?",
    "answer": "They can be removed by periodically running `rm -ri ~/.starccm*` and replying yes when prompted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the suggested Slurm account for a STAR-CCM+ job on Fir/Rorqual/Nibi?",
    "answer": "The suggested Slurm account is `def-group`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules should be loaded for STAR-CCM+ version 20.04.007 on Fir/Rorqual/Nibi?",
    "answer": "You should load `StdEnv/2023` and then `starccm-mixed/20.04.007` (or `starccm/20.04.007-R8`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `SIM_FILE` variable in the STAR-CCM+ Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The `SIM_FILE` variable is used to specify your input simulation filename, such as `mysample.sim`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which MPI implementation is used for STAR-CCM+ jobs on Fir/Rorqual/Nibi when using a Siemens PoD license?",
    "answer": "Intel MPI with `psm2` fabric is used, specified by `-mpi intel -fabric psm2`."
