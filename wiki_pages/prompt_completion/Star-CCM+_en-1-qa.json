    "question": "What is STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "STAR-CCM+ is a multidisciplinary engineering simulation suite developed by Siemens, used to model acoustics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, rheology, multiphase flows, particle flows, solid mechanics, reacting flows, electrochemistry, and electromagnetics."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need my own license to use STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "Yes, you will need to have your own license to use STAR-CCM+, as the host provides the binaries but not the licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I purchase a remote POD license for STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "A remote POD license can be purchased directly from Siemens."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use a local institutional license for STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "Yes, a local license hosted at your institution can be used, provided it can be accessed through the firewall from the cluster where jobs are to be run."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I configure my account to use a license server with the STAR-CCM+ module?",
    "answer": "To configure your account, create a license file named `$HOME/.licenses/starccm.lic` with the content `SERVER <server> ANY <port>\nUSE_SERVER`, replacing `<server>` with the hostname or IP address and `<port>` with the static vendor port of your license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it necessary to manually set the `CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable for STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "No, it is not required to manually set `CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE` in your Slurm script; when a Star-CCM+ module is loaded, this variable is automatically set to your `$HOME/.licenses/starccm.lic` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific steps are required for researchers with a Siemens POD license?",
    "answer": "Researchers with a POD license must manually set the `LM_PROJECT` environment variable equal to their CD-ADAPCO PROJECT ID in their Slurm script. Additionally, the `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file should be configured as `SERVER flex.cd-adapco.com ANY 1999\nUSE_SERVER`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do when submitting a job for the first time with a Siemens remote pay-on-usage license server?",
    "answer": "If you are using a Siemens remote pay-on-usage license server, create a `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file with the content `SERVER flex.cd-adapco.com ANY 1999\nUSE_SERVER`, and license checkouts should work immediately."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are needed if I'm using an institutional license server for STAR-CCM+ on a cluster?",
    "answer": "After creating your `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file, you must submit a problem ticket to technical support to coordinate the necessary one-time network firewall changes required to access it from the Alliance cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a common troubleshooting step if I have problems getting STAR-CCM+ licensing to work?",
    "answer": "If you still have problems with licensing, try removing or renaming the file `~/.flexlmrc`, as previous search paths or license server settings might be stored in it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do temporary output files from STAR-CCM+ jobs accumulate, and how can they be removed?",
    "answer": "Temporary output files from STAR-CCM+ jobs may accumulate in hidden directories named `~/.star-version_number`, consuming quota space. These can be removed by periodically running `rm -ri ~/.starccm*` and replying yes when prompted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Slurm module typically needs to be loaded for STAR-CCM+ jobs on Fir/Rorqual/Nibi clusters using StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "For STAR-CCM+ jobs on Fir/Rorqual/Nibi clusters using StdEnv/2023, you typically need to load `starccm-mixed/20.04.007` (or `starccm/20.04.007-R8`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the number of cores (`NCORE`) calculated in the example Slurm scripts for STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "The number of cores (`NCORE`) is calculated as `NCORE=$((SLURM_NNODES * SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK * SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE))`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to launch STAR-CCM+ for a Siemens PoD license on Fir/Rorqual/Nibi clusters in a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The command is `starccm+ -jvmargs -Xmx4G -jvmargs -Djava.io.tmpdir=$SLURM_TMPDIR -batch -power -podkey $LM_PROJECT -np $NCORE -nbuserdir $SLURM_TMPDIR -machinefile $SLURM_TMPDIR/machinefile $JAVA_FILE $SIM_FILE -mpi intel -fabric psm2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to launch STAR-CCM+ for an institutional license on Narval clusters in a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The command is `starccm+ -jvmargs -Xmx4G -jvmargs -Djava.io.tmpdir=$SLURM_TMPDIR -batch -np $NCORE -nbuserdir $SLURM_TMPDIR -machinefile $SLURM_TMPDIR/machinefile $JAVA_FILE $SIM_FILE -mpi openmpi`."
