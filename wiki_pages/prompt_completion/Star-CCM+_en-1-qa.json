  },
  {
    "question": "What types of licenses can be used for STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "Either a remote POD license from Siemens or a local license hosted at your institution, provided it can be accessed through the firewall from the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure your account to use a license server with the Star-CCM+ module?",
    "answer": "Create a license file `$HOME/.licenses/starccm.lic` with the layout: `SERVER <server> ANY <port>\nUSE_SERVER`, where `<server>` and `<port>` specify the hostname/IP and static vendor port of the license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the content of the `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file for a POD license purchased from Siemens (on most clusters)?",
    "answer": "The file should contain: `SERVER flex.cd-adapco.com ANY 1999\nUSE_SERVER`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What additional step is required for POD licenses on any cluster (except Niagara) besides creating the license file?",
    "answer": "You must set LM_PROJECT to CD-ADAPCO PROJECT ID in your slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the double-precision flavor of STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "Load the `starccm` module, for example, `module load starccm/19.04.007-R8`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the mixed-precision flavor of STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "Load the `starccm-mixed` module, for example, `module load starccm-mixed/19.04.007`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if an institutional license server is used for STAR-CCM+ on a cluster for the first time?",
    "answer": "After creating the `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file, you must submit a problem ticket to technical support to coordinate necessary one-time network firewall changes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file might cause licensing problems with STAR-CCM+ and how can it be addressed?",
    "answer": "The `~/.flexlmrc` file might store previous search paths or license server settings, and problems can be resolved by removing or renaming it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do temporary output files from STAR-CCM+ jobs accumulate?",
    "answer": "Temporary output files may accumulate in hidden directories named `~/.star-version_number`, consuming valuable quota space."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can temporary STAR-CCM+ output files be removed?",
    "answer": "These files can be removed by periodically running `rm -ri ~/.starccm*` and replying yes when prompted."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a Slurm script, which variable is used to specify the Siemens Power on Demand (PoD) Key?",
