    "answer": "Finding a flavour's UUID in Horizon is more difficult; you can select a flavour by name after opening the instance launch dialog and selecting the `Flavor` pane. To get the actual ID, you can either use the name for an initial Terraform run and extract the ID from the output/state file, or switch to using the OpenStack CLI (which is recommended)."
