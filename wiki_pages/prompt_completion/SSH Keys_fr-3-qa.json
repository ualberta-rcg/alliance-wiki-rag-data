    "question": "How can you generate an SSH key using a type other than the default RSA?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How do you strengthen an RSA SSH key by increasing its length?",
    "answer": "To strengthen an RSA key with a longer key, you can use the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa-sha2-512 -b 4096`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of defining constraints in the public SSH key syntax?",
    "answer": "Defining constraints in the public SSH key syntax limits what the key can do."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default behavior of an SSH public key if no constraints are defined?",
    "answer": "By default, an SSH public key without any defined constraints can perform all actions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you restrict an SSH public key to only execute a specific command, like `squeue --me`?",
    "answer": "You can define a constraint like `restrict,command=\"squeue --me\"` in the public key syntax to limit it to a single operation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an SSH public key be constrained to allow only SFTP operations?",
    "answer": "To limit an SSH public key to only SFTP, you can use the constraint `restrict,command=\"/usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an SSH public key be restricted to only allow connections from a specific host?",
    "answer": "An SSH public key can be restricted to a specific host by adding `restrict,from=\"d24-141-114-17.home.cgocable.net\"` to its syntax."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of limiting the hosts that can connect using an SSH key?",
    "answer": "Limiting the hosts is an excellent way to minimize the risk that the SSH key might be compromised."
  },
  {
    "question": "What effect does the `restrict` keyword have on pty allocation when used in SSH public key constraints?",
    "answer": "The `restrict` keyword disables pty allocation, which can lead to unusual behavior."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you allow pty allocation for an interactive SSH session while still restricting it to a specific host?",
    "answer": "You can allow pty allocation for an interactive session while restricting it to a specific host by adding `pty` to the constraints, for example: `restrict,from=\"d24-141-114-17.home.cgocable.net\",pty`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more detailed information about SSH public key constraints?",
    "answer": "More information about SSH public key constraints can be found in the `sshd man` page (by running `man sshd` under Linux)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key best practice regarding the uniqueness of SSH keys?",
    "answer": "SSH keys must be unique to a particular account and never used by more than one person."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should a private SSH key be stored if you are sharing a computer with others?",
    "answer": "If sharing a computer, your private SSH key should be saved in a secure location accessible only to you, or on a USB key."
  },
  {
    "question": "What protection is strongly recommended for your private SSH key?",
    "answer": "It is strongly recommended to always encrypt your private SSH key with a passphrase of at least 15 characters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should a private SSH key ever be shared with others?",
    "answer": "No, you should never share your private SSH key with anyone."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it permissible to copy your private SSH key to a remote computer?",
    "answer": "No, you should never copy your private SSH key to a remote computer; it should never leave your workstation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a good practice if you have multiple personal computers requiring SSH access?",
    "answer": "You can create dedicated SSH key pairs for each of your personal computers."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify a named SSH key, like `Laptop_RSA4096`, when connecting via SSH?",
    "answer": "When connecting with a named SSH key, you must use the `-i` option to specify the key; the command would be `ssh -i Laptop_RSA4096 username@host`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tool is recommended for easier management of SSH keys?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to use `ssh-agent` to work with your keys more easily."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tool should be used in conjunction with `agent-forwarding`?",
    "answer": "If you are using `agent-forwarding`, you should also use `ssh-askpass`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended practice to limit the scope and capabilities of your public SSH key?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to define constraints for your public SSH key to limit its scope."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are common reasons for an SSH key to be revoked?",
    "answer": "An SSH key can be revoked if it is used by more than one person, or if the private key is compromised due to poor management, theft, or a security breach."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the security risk associated with a compromised SSH key?",
    "answer": "A compromised SSH key poses a significant security risk, as a malicious person could use it to gain access to systems and sensitive data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the Alliance's SSH key revocation list?",
    "answer": "The Alliance's revocation list is a register of SSH keys that are no longer trusted or are considered invalid, preventing them from being used to access Alliance services."
  },
  {
    "question": "What immediate steps should be taken if an SSH key is believed to be revoked?",
    "answer": "If an SSH key is believed to be revoked, it is very important to immediately replace it with a new key and delete the revoked key from all services (Alliance and others) to prevent unauthorized access."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted if an SSH key is mistakenly included in the revocation list or for related questions?",
    "answer": "If an SSH key is mistakenly in the revocation list or if you have questions about it, you should write to technical support."
