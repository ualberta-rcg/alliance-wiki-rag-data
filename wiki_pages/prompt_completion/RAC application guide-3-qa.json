    "question": "What is the minimum GPU (RGU-years) required for an HPC request?",
    "answer": "A GPU request must be equal to or greater than 25 reference GPU units (RGU) years in each of the clusters where those resources are needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does RGU stand for?",
    "answer": "RGU stands for Reference GPU Unit, which measures the amount of GPU resources used."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the RGU value determined for a GPU model?",
    "answer": "RGU represents the 'cost' of utilizing a particular GPU model, and its value varies based on the GPU's performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some examples of RGU values for specific GPU models?",
    "answer": "For example, 1 GPU A100-40GB equals 4.0 RGU, 1 GPU H100_2g.20GB equals 3.5 RGU, and 1 GPU H100-80GB equals 12.2 RGU."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is required when requesting GPU resources in the online form?",
    "answer": "When requesting GPU resources in the online form, applicants must specify the particular GPU model they intend to use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is GPU usage 'charged' in RGUs if resources are provided for free to Canadian researchers?",
    "answer": "GPU usage is 'charged' in RGUs to account for the wide range of performance among different GPU models, which helps prioritize groups that have not yet used their allocated share when scheduling resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum project storage (TB) required for an HPC request?",
    "answer": "The minimum project storage is 41 TB."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the minimum project storage apply per cluster or as a total sum across clusters?",
    "answer": "The minimum of 41 TB is the sum of all project storage needed across all general-purpose clusters (Fir, Nibi, Rorqual, and Narval), contrary to CPU and GPU where the minimum applies per cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I request both project and nearline storage if only one meets the minimum requirement?",
    "answer": "Yes, if you need both project and nearline storage, you can request both resources as long as one of the requests is equal to or greater than its specified minimum. In such a case, the online form must include both project and nearline storage resources needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the 41 TB minimum project storage apply to the Niagara cluster?",
    "answer": "No, the 41 TB minimum amount does not apply to the Niagara cluster; any amount of project storage needed on Niagara must be requested through the RAC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum nearline storage (TB) required for an HPC request?",
    "answer": "The minimum nearline storage is 101 TB."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the minimum nearline storage apply per cluster or as a total sum across clusters?",
    "answer": "The minimum of 101 TB is the sum of all nearline storage needed across all general-purpose clusters (Fir, Nibi, Rorqual, and Narval), contrary to CPU and GPU where the minimum applies per cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the nearline storage minimum apply to the HPSS cluster?",
    "answer": "No, the minimum nearline storage amount does not apply to the HPSS cluster; any amount of project storage needed on HPSS must be requested through the RAC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum dCache storage (TB) that must be requested?",
    "answer": "Any amount of dCache storage must be requested, as the minimum is 0 TB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the minimum requirements for Cloud Compute Cloud VCPU, Compute Cloud VGPU, Persistent Cloud VCPU, Volume and Snapshot Storage, Shared Filesystem Storage, and Object Storage?",
    "answer": "The minimums are: Compute Cloud VCPU (VCPU-years) = 81, Compute Cloud VGPU (RGU-years) = 3.6, Persistent Cloud VCPU (VCPU-years) = 26, Volume and Snapshot Storage (TB) = 11, Shared Filesystem Storage (TB) = 11, and Object Storage (TB) = 11."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is eligibility determined if a project needs multiple cloud resources on a specific site?",
    "answer": "As long as one of the resources needed in a particular cloud site is equal to or greater than its specified minimum, the entire request for that site is eligible. In that case, the online form must include all cloud resources needed on that site, even if some amounts are below the minimums."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is important to ensure when filling out the online application form for resource requests?",
    "answer": "It is extremely important that the online application form includes a request for every resource (CPU, GPU, storage, or cloud) that your project needs on each cluster, with no discrepancies between the application document and the online form."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if there's a difference between the resources requested in the attached application document and the online form?",
    "answer": "In case of discrepancy, what was requested in the online form will prevail."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can applicants find a list of available systems for the competition?",
    "answer": "Applicants should visit the 'Available Resources' page for a list of systems and to understand how resources must be requested in the online form."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a project needs 180 core-years and 50 TB of project storage on Fir, what should be requested in the RAC application?",
    "answer": "The RAC application should only request 50 TB of project storage on Fir. The CPU should not be requested because 180 core-years is below the 200 core-years minimum, and it might be obtainable without a RAC allocation."
