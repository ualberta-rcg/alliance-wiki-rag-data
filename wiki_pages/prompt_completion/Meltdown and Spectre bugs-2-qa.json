  {
    "question": "What are Meltdown and Spectre?",
    "answer": "Meltdown and Spectre are bugs related to speculative execution in various CPU architectures developed over the past ten to fifteen years."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which processors are particularly affected by Meltdown and Spectre?",
    "answer": "Processors from Intel and AMD are particularly affected, including those in use on Compute Canada clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Has Compute Canada taken action regarding the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "Yes, Compute Canada personnel have patched systems deemed sensitive to these vulnerabilities, and all vulnerable equipment operated by Compute Canada has been patched."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was required to patch the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "Updates to patch the vulnerabilities required updating the operating system and rebooting the nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "When were the updates for Meltdown and Spectre applied at Graham?",
    "answer": "Updates were applied at Graham between 2018 January 5 and January 31, with most nodes updated by January 13."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the potential performance impacts of the operating system patches for Meltdown and Spectre?",
    "answer": "Cited figures vary from alarming (up to a 30% or even 50% performance hit) to very minimal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which types of tasks are most heavily affected by the security patches?",
    "answer": "Tasks which involve a lot of input/output (reading and writing files) seem to be most heavily affected, such as databases or file transfers (e.g. rsync)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are most high-performance computing jobs affected by the patches?",
    "answer": "Most high performance computing jobs should be minimally affected since the vast majority of the run time is spent computing rather than doing input and output."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do different processor generations experience the same performance impact from the patches?",
    "answer": "No, different processor generations are affected to different degrees, with the most notable performance degradation reported for older processors."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will Compute Canada apply future patches for these vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "Yes, if and when vendors release new patches, these will also be applied."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is my responsibility if I operate my own virtual machine in the Compute Canada cloud?",
    "answer": "If you are operating your own virtual machine in our cloud, you are responsible for updating its operating system to include the latest security patches."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should I contact if I believe my application's performance is severely impacted by the security patches?",
    "answer": "You should contact our Technical support team if you believe that your application may be severely impacted by the security patches."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information should I provide to Technical Support regarding performance impacts?",
    "answer": "You are encouraged to bring forward comparative performance numbers of your application (job run times before and after the announcement, for example)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How often should I update my virtual machine's operating system on the Compute Canada Cloud?",
    "answer": "You should update your virtual machine's operating system to the latest version frequently to ensure it has the latest security patches to address these bugs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find general information about Spectre and Meltdown?",
    "answer": "Other general information about Spectre and Meltdown is available on the US-CERT web site."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a tool available to detect Spectre and Meltdown?",
    "answer": "Yes, Red Hat provides a 'Spectre and Meltdown detector tool' as listed in the references."
