    "question": "What is 3D Slicer?",
    "answer": "3D Slicer is an open-source software platform designed for medical image informatics, image processing, and three-dimensional visualization."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who developed 3D Slicer?",
    "answer": "It was developed over two decades with support from the National Institutes of Health and a global developer community."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can use 3D Slicer?",
    "answer": "Slicer provides free, powerful cross-platform processing tools to physicians, researchers, and the general public."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should intense use of Slicer not be performed?",
    "answer": "Intense use of Slicer should never be performed on the login nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended way to use Slicer for visualization?",
    "answer": "If you must visualize your data using the GUI, you should do so on an interactive node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if parallel rendering is used on shared login nodes with Slicer?",
    "answer": "Using parallel rendering on the shared login nodes will result in the termination of your session."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to use the Slicer GUI?",
    "answer": "Using the Slicer GUI requires X11 forwarding to be enabled."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find information on X11 forwarding with MobaXTerm?",
    "answer": "Information on how to connect with MobaXTerm and use X11 forwarding can be found at the 'Connecting with MobaXTerm' link."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should an interactive job be requested for Slicer GUI use?",
    "answer": "Interactive jobs should be requested because runtime is limited on login nodes, providing more time for exploring and visualizing data, and allowing the use of more cores for faster processing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request an interactive job with X11 forwarding for Slicer?",
    "answer": "You can request an interactive job using the command: `salloc --time=1:0:0 --ntasks=2 --x11 --account=def-someuser`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `--x11` argument do in the `salloc` command for Slicer?",
    "answer": "The `--x11` argument connects you to a compute node with X11 forwarding enabled, which is necessary for the Slicer GUI."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to load and run Slicer on an interactive node?",
    "answer": "First, load Slicer with `module load slicer`, then run it with `Slicer`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you terminate an interactive job after using Slicer?",
    "answer": "Once done, terminate the interactive job by typing `exit`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should the command-line interface and batch processing be used for Slicer?",
    "answer": "The command-line interface and batch processing should be used if you need to perform the same task on a large number of images, or if you don't need to see processed images as they are created."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can examples for Slicer batch processing be found?",
    "answer": "Examples for Slicer batch processing are available on the Slicer discourse forum, with specific links provided for topics like 'rtstruct-to-label-map' and 'slicer-batch-processing-question-no-main-window-python-script'."
