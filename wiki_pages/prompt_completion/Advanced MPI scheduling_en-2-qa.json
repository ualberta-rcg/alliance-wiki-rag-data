    "question": "What is the main function of `srun application.exe` within Slurm?",
    "answer": "`srun application.exe` automatically distributes processes to the precise resources allocated to the job."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does `srun` compare to `mpirun` in terms of abstraction?",
    "answer": "`srun` is at a higher level of abstraction than `mpirun`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can `srun` handle everything `mpirun` can?",
    "answer": "Anything that can be done with `mpirun` can be done with `srun`, and more."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kinds of computations can `srun` distribute?",
    "answer": "`srun` is the tool in Slurm to distribute any kind of computation, including MPI, OpenMP, hybrid, serial farming, pipelining, and multiprogram applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which older scheduler tool does `srun` replace?",
    "answer": "`srun` replaces Torque\u2019s `pbsdsh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when `srun` starts an application in Slurm?",
    "answer": "When `srun` starts an application, a job step is started, the environment variables `SLURM_STEP_ID` and `SLURM_PROCID` are initialized correctly, and correct accounting information is recorded."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might `mpiexec` offer better performance than `srun`?",
    "answer": "Better performance might be achievable with `mpiexec` than with `srun` under certain circumstances."
  },
  {
    "question": "What risk does using `srun` help to minimize?",
    "answer": "Using `srun` minimizes the risk of a mismatch between the resources allocated by Slurm and those used by Open MPI."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the official documentation for `sbatch`?",
    "answer": "The official documentation for `sbatch` is available at [https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html sbatch] documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the official documentation for `srun`?",
    "answer": "The official documentation for `srun` is available at [https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html srun] documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find information about Open MPI and Slurm?",
    "answer": "Information about Open MPI and Slurm can be found at [https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=slurm Open MPI] and Slurm."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it often unnecessary to specify node lists or process counts to `mpirun` when using Slurm?",
    "answer": "Modern schedulers like Slurm already provide many things that `mpirun` needs, such as the list of nodes on which to run or the number of processes to launch, and task affinity is resolved by the scheduler."
