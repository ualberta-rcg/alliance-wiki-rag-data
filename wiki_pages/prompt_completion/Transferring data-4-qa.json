    "question": "What does SCP stand for?",
    "answer": "SCP stands for Secure Copy Protocol."
  },
  {
    "question": "What protocol does SCP use to transfer data securely?",
    "answer": "SCP uses the SSH protocol to encrypt data being transferred."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does SCP support synchronization of files like Globus or rsync?",
    "answer": "No, SCP does not support synchronization."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I copy a local file named `foo.txt` to the `work` directory on the remote cluster `rorqual.alliancecan.ca` using SCP?",
    "answer": "You can use the command: `scp foo.txt username@rorqual.alliancecan.ca:work/`"
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I copy a file named `output.dat` from my project space on the `Fir` cluster to my local computer's current directory using SCP?",
    "answer": "You can use the command: `scp username@fir.alliancecan.ca:projects/def-jdoe/username/results/output.dat .`"
  },
  {
    "question": "From which computer should an SCP connection always be initiated?",
    "answer": "The SCP command should always be initiated from your local computer, not the remote cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What SCP option is used for recursively transferring directories and files?",
    "answer": "The `-r` option is used to recursively transfer a set of directories and files."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to use `scp -r` to transfer data into the `/project` filesystems, and why?",
    "answer": "No, it is recommended against using `scp -r` to transfer data into `/project` because the setgid bit is turned off in created directories, which can lead to `Disk quota exceeded` errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What SCP option is needed if I use a custom SSH key name instead of the default ones?",
    "answer": "You will need to use the `-i` option of scp and specify the path to your private key before the file paths."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do before initiating any data transfer to prevent issues with unreadable data?",
    "answer": "Before initiating any transfer, make sure you can read all the contents of the directories you would like to transfer."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I list all items not readable to me in a specific directory on a Linux system?",
    "answer": "You can use the command: `find <directory_name> ! -readable -ls`"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main checks to perform if I am unable to write new data during a transfer?",
    "answer": "You should double-check the storage usage to ensure enough space and files are available, and double-check filesystem permissions to ensure you have write permission at the destination."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I determine the apparent size of a dataset before transferring it, especially considering potential compression differences across clusters?",
    "answer": "You can use the `du -b dataset` command to get the apparent size of the data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might the reported space usage for the same dataset differ significantly between two clusters?",
    "answer": "On some clusters, the filesystem automatically compresses files and reports usage by the compressed data's disk usage, while on others, it reports the apparent size of the files, meaning 1 TB of compressed data could become 2 TB of data on another cluster."
