    "question": "How do server environments differ from typical graphical user interfaces (GUIs)?",
    "answer": "Server environments are controlled by typing commands via a command line interface, unlike GUIs which involve clicking windows, menus, and buttons."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to a program submitted on a server if CPU cores are not immediately available?",
    "answer": "A program may be put on a waiting list and will begin when the necessary CPU cores become available to prevent interference and performance loss."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a job script?",
    "answer": "A job script is a small text file that specifies what program to run, where to get the input, and where to put the output for a computation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of the scheduler in processing a job script?",
    "answer": "The scheduler is a piece of software that receives the job script and decides when and where the job will run."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is user interaction typically required with a program while a job is running?",
    "answer": "Normally, there is no interaction between the user and the program while the job is running, although its progress can be checked."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do lines starting with `#SBATCH` in a job script indicate?",
    "answer": "Lines starting with `#SBATCH` are directives to the scheduler, providing information about the job's requirements, such as its needed run time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key responsibilities of a job scheduler?",
    "answer": "A job scheduler's responsibilities include maintaining a database of jobs, enforcing policies regarding limits and priorities, ensuring resources are not overloaded (e.g., assigning each CPU core to one job at a time), deciding which jobs to run on which compute nodes, launching them, and cleaning up after each job finishes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which specific job scheduler is used on the clusters mentioned in the document?",
    "answer": "The Slurm Workload Manager is used on these clusters to handle job scheduling responsibilities."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are resources requested for a calculation run as a job?",
    "answer": "Resources needed for a calculation are requested using the job script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are two common resources associated with a job?",
    "answer": "Two common resources associated with a job are time and the number of processors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a job requests less time or memory than it actually needs?",
    "answer": "If a job requests less than the calculation needs, the job will be killed for exceeding the requested time or memory limit."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the consequences of requesting more resources than a job actually needs?",
    "answer": "If a job requests more resources than it needs, it may wait longer than necessary before it starts, and once running, it will needlessly prevent others from using those resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a job script, like `simple_job.sh`, be submitted using Slurm?",
    "answer": "A job script can be submitted using the `sbatch` command, for example: `sbatch simple_job.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is provided immediately after successfully submitting a batch job?",
    "answer": "A unique job ID, such as '1234' in the example 'Submitted batch job 1234', is assigned and printed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a user check the status of their jobs in Slurm?",
    "answer": "The `sq` command is used to determine the status of submitted jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two most common states for a job displayed by `sq`?",
    "answer": "The two most common states for a job are `PD` for pending and `R` for running."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user tell if a job has finished using the `sq` command?",
    "answer": "When a job has finished, it no longer appears in the output of the `sq` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of a job ID?",
    "answer": "A job ID is a unique identification number used to distinguish multiple jobs in the system, even if they have the same name."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the output of a Slurm job placed by default if no specific output location is provided?",
    "answer": "By default, the output is placed in a file named `slurm-JOBID.out`, where `JOBID` is the unique job identification number."
