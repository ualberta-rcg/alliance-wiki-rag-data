    "question": "How many MPI processes are typically used in a parallel MMPBSA job example?",
    "answer": "The example parallel MMPBSA job uses 32 MPI processes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does MMPBSA scale linearly?",
    "answer": "MMPBSA scales linearly because each trajectory frame is processed independently."
