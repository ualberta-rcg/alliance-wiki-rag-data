  {
    "question": "How can I fix an 'End of file in ZSymb' error if I forgot to specify 'geom=check'?",
    "answer": "If you intended to get the z-matrix and parameters from the checkpoint file but forgot, you need to add `geom=check` to your input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the Gaussian error 'RFO could not converge Lambda' or 'Linear search skipped for unknown reason' mean?",
    "answer": "This error indicates that the rational function optimization was unsuccessful during a linear search, most likely because the Hessian is no longer valid."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I fix the 'Linear search skipped for unknown reason' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You should restart the optimization using `Opt=CalcFC`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Variable index of 3000 on card XXX is out of range' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This is an input error, typically meaning you forgot to add a variable in your Z-matrix to your list. The error message will specify which atom's definition (e.g., atom #15) is missing its corresponding variable."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve a 'Variable index out of range' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You need to add the missing variable to your input, corresponding to the atom specified in the error message in the Z-matrix."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does an 'Unknown center XXX' error indicate in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This is an input error where you are attempting to define an atom in a Z-matrix using another non-existent atom, such as 'X' in the example."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I fix the 'Unknown center XXX' error in a Gaussian job?",
    "answer": "You need to correct the atom name in your Z-matrix."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Determination of dummy atom variables in z-matrix conversion failed' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error occurs when the conversion from redundant internal coordinates back to Z-matrix coordinates fails due to dummy atoms."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if my Gaussian job reports 'Determination of dummy atom variables in z-matrix conversion failed'?",
    "answer": "If the geometry optimization converged but Gaussian couldn't convert back to the input z-matrix, you will have to make do with Cartesian coordinates."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'malloc failed' error mean in Gaussian output?",
    "answer": "This is not strictly a Gaussian error but typically means that the computer has run out of memory, possibly because you requested too much memory in the `%mem` line."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I fix a 'malloc failed' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You can either reduce the amount specified with `%mem` in your Gaussian input file, or increase the amount of memory requested in your job script using `--mem=`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Charge and multiplicity card seems defective' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This input error occurs if the title line is forgotten when using `geom=modify`. Gaussian then misinterprets the charge/multiplicity line as the title and the variable list as the charge/multiplicity."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve a 'Charge and multiplicity card seems defective' error?",
    "answer": "You need to add a title line to your Gaussian input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does Gaussian report 'Attempt to redefine unrecognized symbol \"XXXXX\"'?",
    "answer": "This input error occurs when you are attempting to use `geom=modify`, but the variable whose value you are trying to replace is not present in the checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the fix for 'Attempt to redefine unrecognized symbol' in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You need to either specify the correct checkpoint file or the correct variable that exists within it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Inconsistency #2 in MakNEB' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This is an input error related to a change in point group, often when `iop(2/15=4,2/16=2,2/17=7)` was specified to try to avoid program crashing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I fix the 'Inconsistency #2 in MakNEB' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You should be very careful with `iop` directives, or consider removing them altogether."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'galloc: could not allocate memory' mean in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This is a memory allocation error indicating a lack of available memory. Gaussian typically uses about 1GB more memory than specified in the `%mem` line."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I resolve 'galloc: could not allocate memory' in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "Ensure that the value for `%mem` in your Gaussian input file is at least 1GB less than the value specified with `--mem=` in your job submission script. Conversely, the `--mem=` value should be at least 1GB greater than `%mem`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'No such file or directory' error (PGFIO/stdio) in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error occurs because the file named in the output, or its containing directory, does not exist. This often happens if `GAUSS_SCRDIR` is set to a directory that doesn't exist."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I fix a 'No such file or directory' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You should create the missing directory using the `mkdir` command, or change the definition of `GAUSS_SCRDIR` to name an existing directory."
