    "question": "What tools does GROMACS offer for post-processing and analysis?",
    "answer": "GROMACS provides many tools for common post-processing and analysis tasks. Its manual lists commands by topic and name, each with a description and reference link."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file formats can GROMACS analysis commands typically read?",
    "answer": "GROMACS analysis commands typically read trajectory files (XTC, TNG, TRR) and coordinate files (GRO, PDB, TPR, etc.)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of output do GROMACS analysis commands produce?",
    "answer": "GROMACS analysis commands typically produce graphs in XVG format, which can be used by the Grace plotting tool. XVG files are text files that can also be analyzed by scripts or imported into spreadsheets."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is VMD used for?",
    "answer": "VMD is a molecular visualization program used to display, animate, and analyze large biomolecular systems with 3D graphics and integrated scripts. It can also inspect GROMACS trajectories and offers many integrated and external analysis plugins."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can VMD be used from the command line?",
    "answer": "Yes, VMD can be used in command-line mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Python packages are available for GROMACS trajectory analysis?",
    "answer": "MDAnalysis and MDTraj are two Python packages, offered as precompiled Python wheels, that can read and write GROMACS trajectory files (TRR and XTC) and offer various analysis functions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the capabilities of MDAnalysis and MDTraj?",
    "answer": "MDAnalysis and MDTraj can read and write GROMACS trajectory (TRR, XTC) and coordinate files, offer many analysis functions, have versatile atom selection languages, and expose trajectory coordinates. They integrate well with Python data science packages like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and plotting libraries such as Matplotlib/Pyplot and Seaborn."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can MDAnalysis read GROMACS topology information?",
    "answer": "MDAnalysis can read topological information from GROMACS TPR files, though not always from those produced by recent GROMACS versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is PLUMED?",
    "answer": "PLUMED is an open-source library used for calculating free energy in molecular systems, compatible with various molecular dynamics programs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are 'gromacs-plumed' modules?",
    "answer": "The 'gromacs-plumed' modules are versions of GROMACS that have been patched with PLUMED modifications, enabling them to execute metadynamic simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are required to use gromacs-plumed/2022.6 with CPU support under StdEnv/2020?",
    "answer": "To use gromacs-plumed/2022.6 with CPU support under StdEnv/2020, you need to load `StdEnv/2020`, `gcc/9.3.0`, `openmpi/4.0.3`, and `gromacs-plumed/2022.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are required to use gromacs-plumed/2022.6 with GPU (CUDA) support under StdEnv/2020?",
    "answer": "To use gromacs-plumed/2022.6 with GPU (CUDA) support under StdEnv/2020, you need to load `StdEnv/2020`, `gcc/9.3.0`, `cuda/11.4`, `openmpi/4.0.3`, and `gromacs-plumed/2022.6`."
