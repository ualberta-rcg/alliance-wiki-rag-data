    "question": "What are images in the context of virtual disks?",
    "answer": "Images are files that contain the contents of a virtual disk, often including a base operating system used to create a volume or an ephemeral disk from which a virtual machine boots."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the key difference between ephemeral disks and volumes?",
    "answer": "Ephemeral disk files are destroyed when a VM is destroyed, in contrast to volumes, which are not."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are virtual machine images portable?",
    "answer": "Yes, images are portable; they can be downloaded from the cloud, used to create a VM on a laptop, and uploaded to another cloud to create a new VM."

    "answer": "A list of images provided by staff can be found under 'Cloud resources#Images'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the procedure for creating an image from a VM differ?",
    "answer": "The procedure for creating an image from a VM depends on whether it is booting from a volume (typically \"p\" flavors) or from an ephemeral disk (typically \"c\" flavors)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create an image from a VM that is booting from an ephemeral disk?",
    "answer": "You can use the OpenStack command line client with the command: `openstack server image create <server-name>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What parts of a VM are included when creating an image from an ephemeral disk using `openstack server image create`?",
    "answer": "This action will only include the VM's root drive (e.g., /dev/vda) in the image."
  },
  {
    "question": "What data is NOT included when creating an image from a VM booting from an ephemeral disk?",
    "answer": "Ephemeral drives and non-boot attached volumes will not be included in the image."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended before creating an image from a VM to avoid an inconsistent filesystem state?",
    "answer": "It is recommended that the VM be shut off (not deleted) before an image is created from it to prevent capturing the filesystem in an inconsistent state."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find instructions for creating an image from a VM booting from a volume?",
    "answer": "Instructions can be found under 'Working_with_volumes#Creating_an_image_from_a_volume'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the two-step process for sharing an image with another project?",
    "answer": "First, a member of the project owning the image must share it with a second project. Second, a member of the second project must accept the newly shared image."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which OpenStack command is used to share an image with another project?",
    "answer": "The `glance member-create <IMAGE_ID> <MEMBER_ID>` command is used to share an image with a second project."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is needed for the `glance member-create` command?",
    "answer": "The command requires the `IMAGE_ID` (ID of the image to be shared) and the `MEMBER_ID` (ID of the project to share it with)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which OpenStack command is used to accept a shared image?",
    "answer": "The `glance member-update <IMAGE_ID> <MEMBER_ID> <MEMBER_STATUS>` command is used to accept a shared image."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the valid status values for the `MEMBER_STATUS` parameter when updating image membership?",
    "answer": "Valid values for `MEMBER_STATUS` are `accepted`, `rejected`, and `pending`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after an image is accepted by a second project?",
    "answer": "The image will then be available for use and appear in the OpenStack dashboard's list of images in the second project."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check the status of image membership?",
    "answer": "You can check the status using the command: `glance member-list --image-id <IMAGE_ID>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial steps required before downloading an OpenStack image?",
    "answer": "The first step is to install the OpenStack client and then download and source the OpenStack RC file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you list the available images on your OpenStack project?",
    "answer": "You can list available images using the command: `openstack image list`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What option might be necessary to view all columns when listing OpenStack images?",
    "answer": "An additional option, such as `--long`, might be needed to see all columns depending on the client version."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you download a specific image from OpenStack?",
    "answer": "You can download a specific image with the command: `openstack image save --file ./<file-name-for-image>.<format> <ID>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is required to download a specific image using `openstack image save`?",
    "answer": "You need to specify a file name for the image, its format (matching the 'Disk format' column), and the image's ID."

  {
    "question": "Which command is used to upload an image to OpenStack?",
    "answer": "The command to upload an image is: `openstack image create --file <path-to-local-file-image> --disk-format <format> <new-image-name>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `<path-to-local-file-image>` represent when uploading an image?",
    "answer": "`<path-to-local-file-image>` is the path to the file containing the image you wish to upload from your local machine."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `<format>` parameter when uploading an image?",
    "answer": "`<format>` specifies the disk format of the image; if not specified, the raw format is assumed. It must match the image's actual format to avoid issues."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `<new-image-name>` represent during image upload?",
    "answer": "`<new-image-name>` is the name the image will have as it appears on the OpenStack dashboard."
  },
  {
    "question": "What disk format is assumed if not specified when uploading an image to OpenStack?",
    "answer": "If the disk format is not specified, the raw format is assumed."
