    "question": "What is Delly used for?",
    "answer": "Delly is an integrated structural variant (SV) prediction method that can discover, genotype, and visualize deletions, tandem duplications, inversions, and translocations at single-nucleotide resolution in short-read massively parallel sequencing data. It uses paired-ends, split-reads, and read-depth to sensitively and accurately delineate genomic rearrangements throughout the genome."
