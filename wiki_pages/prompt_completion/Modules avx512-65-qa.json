    "question": "What is MAKER?",
    "answer": "MAKER is a portable and easily configurable genome annotation pipeline designed to allow smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic genome projects to independently annotate their genomes and create genome databases."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of MAKER in genome annotation?",
    "answer": "MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to a genome, produces ab-initio gene predictions, and automatically synthesizes this data into gene annotations with evidence-based quality values."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some extensions available for MAKER 3.01.03?",
    "answer": "Extensions for MAKER 3.01.03 include Acme::Damn-0.08, Bit::Vector-7.4, DBD::Pg-3.14.2, Devel::Symdump-2.18, forks-0.36, Inline-0.86, Inline::C-0.81, IO::All-0.87, IO::Prompt-0.997004, Pegex-0.75, Perl::Unsafe::Signals-0.03, Sys::SigAction-0.23, YAML::PP-0.026, and YAML::XS-0.82."

  {
    "question": "What is Manta used for?",
    "answer": "Manta calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped paired-end sequencing reads. It is optimized for analyzing germline variation in small sets of individuals and somatic variation in tumor/normal sample pairs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of genomic alterations can Manta detect?",
    "answer": "Manta can discover, assemble, and score large-scale SVs, medium-sized indels, and large insertions within a single efficient workflow."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is MarginPolish?",
    "answer": "MarginPolish is a graph-based assembly polisher that iteratively finds multiple probable alignment paths for run-length-encoded reads and uses these to generate a refined sequence."
  },
  {
    "question": "What inputs does MarginPolish require?",
    "answer": "MarginPolish takes a FASTA assembly and an indexed BAM file (ONT reads aligned to the assembly) as input."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is MariaDB?",
    "answer": "MariaDB is an enhanced, drop-in replacement for MySQL, functioning as an open-source relational database management system."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more information about MariaDB?",
    "answer": "More information about MariaDB can be found at https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Database_servers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is MariaDB Connector/C used for?",
    "answer": "MariaDB Connector/C is used to connect applications developed in C/C++ to MariaDB and MySQL databases."
