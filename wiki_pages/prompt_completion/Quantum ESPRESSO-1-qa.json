    "question": "What is Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials."
  },
  {
    "question": "How has Quantum ESPRESSO evolved as a project?",
    "answer": "Quantum ESPRESSO has evolved into a distribution of independent and inter-operable codes, operating in the spirit of an open-source project."
  },
  {
    "question": "What components make up the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution?",
    "answer": "The Quantum ESPRESSO distribution consists of a \u201chistorical\u201d core set of components, a set of plug-ins for advanced tasks, and several third-party packages designed to be inter-operable with the core components."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you begin using Quantum ESPRESSO on the clusters?",
    "answer": "To use Quantum ESPRESSO, you need to load a module."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view the available versions of Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "You can see available versions using the commands `module avail quantumespresso` or `module spider quantumespresso`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load a specific version of Quantum ESPRESSO, for example, version 6.6?",
    "answer": "You can load a specific version by using a command like `module load quantumespresso/6.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the user's responsibility when selecting the process count for Quantum ESPRESSO jobs?",
    "answer": "It is the user's responsibility to choose an efficient number of processes, as suitable selection can be complicated."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there system-wide pseudopotential files for Quantum ESPRESSO on the clusters?",
    "answer": "No, there is no system-wide repository of pseudopotentials for Quantum ESPRESSO on the clusters. Users must find or create and store their own files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What problem has been reported when using Quantum ESPRESSO with OpenMPI 3.1.2?",
    "answer": "Users have reported random segfaults on Cedar when using Quantum ESPRESSO versions compiled for OpenMPI 3.1.2 in single-node jobs (shared memory communication)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended solution if you encounter segfaults with OpenMPI 3.1.2?",
    "answer": "If you experience such problems, first try to use an OpenMPI 2.1.1-based toolchain."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are suggested for an OpenMPI 2.1.1-based toolchain with Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "The suggested modules are `module load gcc/5.4.0`, `module load openmpi/2.1.1`, and `module load quantumespresso/6.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of parameter error can occur when running Grimme-D3 with barium (Ba) in Quantum ESPRESSO?",
    "answer": "Incorrect results may be obtained due to an incorrect value for the r2r4 parameter for barium in the source code file `dft-d3/core.f90`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the correct value for the `r2r4` parameter for barium in Grimme-D3, as opposed to the incorrect one?",
    "answer": "The correct value should be 10.15679528, not 0.15679528."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of Quantum ESPRESSO are confirmed to have the Grimme-D3 parameter error for barium?",
    "answer": "The error has been confirmed by QE developers to exist in all versions from 6.2.1 to 7.1."
