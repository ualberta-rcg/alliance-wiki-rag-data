    "question": "What option should be selected in Globus for file integrity during transfer?",
    "answer": "You should select the 'verify file integrity after transfer' option."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are important considerations if you do not have Globus for data transfer?",
    "answer": "It is especially important to compress your data and avoid duplicates if you do not have Globus."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which tools can be used for data transfer if Globus is not available?",
    "answer": "If Globus is not available, you might use scp, sftp, or rsync."
  },
  {
    "question": "When using tools like scp, sftp, or rsync, what strategy is recommended to handle transfer interruptions?",
    "answer": "Prepare blocks of a few hundred gigabytes that you will transfer one block at a time. If there is an interruption, you will only need to resume the transfer operation on the affected block, and previously transferred data will not be impacted."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is a list of data to transfer useful when using non-Globus tools?",
    "answer": "A list of data to transfer is useful to manage blocks and resume transfers effectively when using non-Globus tools."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the progress of data transfer be monitored when not using Globus?",
    "answer": "You should regularly check the transfer's progression. An indication to watch for is the file size. If there has been no change for some time, intervention might be necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted if it's not possible to resume a data transfer operation?",
    "answer": "If it is not possible to resume the transfer operation, contact technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long can data transfers take, even with Globus?",
    "answer": "Even with Globus, transferring hundreds of gigabytes can take several hours, and hundreds of terabytes can take several days."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done after migration if Globus was not used or its integrity verification option was not selected?",
    "answer": "After migration, if you haven't used Globus or haven't selected the 'verify file integrity' option, make sure the transferred data is not corrupted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a simple method to check for data corruption after transfer?",
    "answer": "A simple way to check for data corruption is to compare the size of the source files to the size of the destination files."
  },
  {
    "question": "For a more thorough check of data integrity after migration, which tools are recommended?",
    "answer": "For a more thorough examination, use `cksum` and `md5sum` to compare the files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What action should be taken if file sizes or checksums do not match after transfer?",
    "answer": "Files whose size or checksum do not match should be transferred again."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users find information on how to use archiving and compression utilities in Linux?",
    "answer": "To learn how to use archiving and compression utilities, use the Linux command `man <command>` or `<command> --help`."
