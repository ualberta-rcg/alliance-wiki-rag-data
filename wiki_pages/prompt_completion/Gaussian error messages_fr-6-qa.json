  {
    "question": "What does the 'malloc failed.' error indicate in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "The 'malloc failed.' error indicates a lack of memory, possibly because too much memory was requested using the `%mem` directive. It is not considered a Gaussian-specific error."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve a 'malloc failed.' error?",
    "answer": "To resolve a 'malloc failed.' error, you should either decrease the value of `%mem` in your Gaussian input file or increase the amount of memory requested in the task script using `--mem=`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Charge and multiplicity card seems defective' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error is typically an input error. In the absence of a title line when using `geom=modify`, the program misinterprets the charge/multiplicity line as the title, and the actual charge/multiplicity line as a list of variables."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you fix a 'Charge and multiplicity card seems defective' error?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you need to enter a title line in your input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'Attempt to redefine unrecognized symbol' error mean in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error signifies an input error where you are requesting `geom=modify`, but a variable you are attempting to change is not found in the checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'Attempt to redefine unrecognized symbol' error be resolved?",
    "answer": "To resolve this error, you should either provide the correct checkpoint file or ensure that the variable you are trying to modify exists within the checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Inconsistency #2 in MakNEB' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "The 'Inconsistency #2 in MakNEB' error is an input error that occurs when the point group has been modified and `iop(2/15=4,2/16=2,2/17=7)` was specified to prevent the program from crashing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I prevent the 'Inconsistency #2 in MakNEB' error?",
    "answer": "To prevent this error, you should exercise extreme caution when using `iop` directives or consider removing them."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the cause of the 'galloc: could not allocate memory' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "The 'galloc: could not allocate memory' error is a memory allocation issue because Gaussian generally uses approximately 1GB more memory than what is explicitly specified by the `%mem` directive."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended memory allocation strategy to avoid the 'galloc: could not allocate memory' error?",
    "answer": "To avoid this error, the value of `%mem` in the Gaussian input file should be at least 1GB lower than the `--mem` value specified in the task script. Conversely, the `--mem` value in the script should be at least 1GB greater than the quantity specified by the `%mem` directive in the input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What triggers a 'PGFIO/stdio: No such file or directory' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error is triggered when the specified file, or the directory containing it, does not exist. This can happen, for instance, if the `GAUSS_SCRDIR` variable points to a non-existent directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I fix a 'No such file or directory' error related to Gaussian scratch files?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you should either create the missing directory using `mkdir` or modify the `GAUSS_SCRDIR` definition to use an existing directory."
