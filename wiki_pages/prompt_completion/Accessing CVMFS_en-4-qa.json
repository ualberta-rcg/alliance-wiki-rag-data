    "question": "What is the purpose of the provided RedHat script for NVIDIA drivers?",
    "answer": "The RedHat script installs NVIDIA drivers and creates symbolic links in `/usr/lib64/nvidia/` pointing to the NVIDIA libraries typically found in `/usr/lib64`. This is necessary because the software environment expects drivers in the `/usr/lib64/nvidia` path."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify the NVIDIA driver version in the RedHat script for installation?",
    "answer": "The NVIDIA driver version is specified by setting the `NVIDIA_DRV_VER` variable in the script, for example, `NVIDIA_DRV_VER=\"410.48\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the Ubuntu script for NVIDIA drivers do?",
    "answer": "The Ubuntu script creates the directory `/usr/lib64/nvidia/` if it doesn't exist, and then creates symbolic links from NVIDIA library files located in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` to `/usr/lib64/nvidia/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to define `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when using this software environment?",
    "answer": "No, defining `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not recommended and can lead to the environment not working, as the software environment is designed to use RUNPATH."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might binary packages like Anaconda fail to find libraries in this software environment?",
    "answer": "Binary packages like Anaconda may not find libraries they usually expect because `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not defined and the software environment's libraries are not installed in default Linux locations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more information about installing binary packages when encountering missing library issues?",
    "answer": "Users should refer to the documentation on 'Installing binary packages' on the 'Installing software in your home directory' page."
