  {
    "question": "What is Cell Ranger?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines for processing Chromium single cell 3-RNA-seq output to align reads, generate gene-cell matrices, and perform clustering and gene expression analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of Cell Ranger support libraries generated by the Chromium Single Cell 3i-v2 reagent kits?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger 1.2 and later versions support libraries generated by the Chromium Single Cell 3i-v2 reagent kits."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the four main gene expression pipelines included in Cell Ranger?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger includes four main gene expression pipelines: cellranger mkfastq, cellranger count, cellranger aggr, and cellranger reanalyze."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'cellranger mkfastq' pipeline?",
    "answer": "The 'cellranger mkfastq' pipeline wraps Illumina's bcl2fastq to correctly demultiplex Chromium-prepared sequencing samples and convert barcode and read data to FASTQ files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'cellranger count' pipeline do?",
    "answer": "The 'cellranger count' pipeline takes FASTQ files from 'cellranger mkfastq' and performs alignment, filtering, and UMI counting."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does 'cellranger aggr' process data?",
    "answer": "The 'cellranger aggr' pipeline aggregates outputs from multiple runs of 'cellranger count', normalizing those runs to the same sequencing depth and then recomputing the gene-barcode matrices and analysis on the combined data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the 'cellranger reanalyze' pipeline?",
    "answer": "The 'cellranger reanalyze' pipeline takes gene-barcode matrices produced by 'cellranger count' or 'cellranger aggr' and reruns the dimensionality reduction, clustering, and gene expression algorithms using tunable parameter settings."
  },
  {
    "question": "What output formats does Cell Ranger provide?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger output is delivered in standard BAM, MEX, CSV, HDF5, and HTML formats that are augmented with cellular information."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is cellsnp-lite designed for?",
    "answer": "cellsnp-lite was initially designed to pileup expressed alleles in single-cell or bulk RNA-seq data for donor deconvolution and doublet detection, and can also be applied to DNA-seq and ATAC-seq data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What software can cellsnp-lite be used with for donor deconvolution?",
    "answer": "cellsnp-lite can be used for donor deconvolution in multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq data, particularly with vireo."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Centrifuge?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge is a novel microbial classification engine that enables rapid, accurate, and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species on desktop computers."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Centrifuge classify sequences?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge uses a novel indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized for metagenomic classification, allowing it to classify sequences at very high speed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the required index size for Centrifuge when using bacterial, viral, and human genomes?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge requires a relatively small index, specifically 4.7 GB, for all complete bacterial and viral genomes plus the human genome."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of Centrifuge are available?",
    "answer": "Available versions of Centrifuge include 1.0.4-beta and 1.0.4.2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the cereal library?",
    "answer": "cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of representations can cereal convert data into?",
    "answer": "cereal can reversibly convert arbitrary data types into compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON representations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the cereal library have external dependencies?",
    "answer": "No, cereal was designed to be fast, light-weight, easy to extend, and has no external dependencies, allowing it to be easily bundled or used standalone."
  },
  {
    "question": "What C++ standard does the cereal library use?",
    "answer": "The cereal library is a C++11 serialization library."
