    "question": "What modules are required to be loaded for the BUSCO Python wheel installation?",
    "answer": "You need to load `StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 python/3.10 augustus/3.5.0 hmmer/3.3.2 blast+/2.13.0 metaeuk/6 prodigal/2.6.3 r/4.3.1 bbmap/38.86`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to create and activate a virtual environment for BUSCO?",
    "answer": "First, run `virtualenv ~/busco_env` to create the environment, then `source ~/busco_env/bin/activate` to activate it."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you install the BUSCO wheel and its dependencies?",
    "answer": "Within the virtual environment, run `pip install --no-index biopython==1.81 pandas==2.1.0 busco==5.5.0`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you validate a BUSCO installation?",
    "answer": "You can validate the installation by running `busco --help`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you freeze the BUSCO virtual environment and its requirements?",
    "answer": "To freeze the environment and requirements, use the command `pip freeze > ~/busco-requirements.txt`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a mandatory step regarding datasets before submitting a BUSCO job?",
    "answer": "You must pre-download any required datasets from https://busco-data.ezlab.org/v5/data/ before submitting your job."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I list the available BUSCO datasets in the terminal?",
    "answer": "You can access the available datasets by typing `busco --list-datasets` in your terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main options for downloading BUSCO datasets?",
    "answer": "The two options are using the `busco` command or the `wget` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the preferred command for downloading BUSCO datasets?",
    "answer": "The preferred option for downloading datasets is the `busco` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you download a specific BUSCO dataset using the `busco` command?",
    "answer": "Type `busco --download [dataset_name]` in your working directory, for example, `busco --download bacteria_odb10`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I download multiple BUSCO datasets at once using the `busco` command?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can perform a bulk download by using arguments like `all`, `prokaryota`, `eukaryota`, or `virus` with the `busco --download` command, such as `busco --download virus`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What actions does the `busco --download` command perform when downloading datasets?",
    "answer": "It creates a BUSCO directory hierarchy, downloads the appropriate datasets, decompresses the file(s), and automatically adds multiple files to the lineages directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the expected directory structure for downloaded BUSCO datasets?",
    "answer": "The hierarchy will be `busco_downloads/` containing `information/`, `lineages/`, and `placement_files/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should BUSCO lineage files be located after using the `busco --download` command?",
    "answer": "All lineage files should be in the `busco_downloads/lineages/` directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does BUSCO find the downloaded lineage datasets when running a job?",
    "answer": "By referring to `--download_path busco_downloads/` in the BUSCO command line, BUSCO will know where to find the lineage dataset argument like `--lineage_dataset bacteria_odb10`. A full path is required if `busco_downloads` is not in the working directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you download a BUSCO dataset using the `wget` command?",
    "answer": "You would typically create a directory (e.g., `mkdir -p busco_downloads/lineages`), navigate into it, use `wget` to download the `.tar.gz` file (e.g., `wget https://busco-data.ezlab.org/v5/data/lineages/bacteria_odb10.2020-03-06.tar.gz`), and then decompress it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to decompress BUSCO dataset files downloaded with `wget`?",
    "answer": "All files downloaded with `wget` must be decompressed using `tar -xvf file.tar.gz`."
