    "question": "What is the primary purpose of journal files in Ansys Fluent?",
    "answer": "Journal files can contain all commands of Fluent's Text User Interface (TUI) and can be used to modify simulation parameters or perform a series of simulations under different conditions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure Fluent journal files to use the more efficient .cas.h5/.dat.h5 file formats starting from version 2020R1?",
    "answer": "You need to add the command `/file/cff-files yes` to the journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the command `/file/confirm-overwrite no` achieve in a Fluent journal file?",
    "answer": "This command prevents Fluent from asking for confirmation when overwriting files by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a Fluent journal file read an input case and data file named `FFF-in`?",
    "answer": "It uses the command `/file/read-case-data FFF-in`."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a Fluent journal file, what command is used to run the solver for a specified number of iterations, for example, 1000?",
    "answer": "The command is `/solve/iterate 1000`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you write the final output case and data file named `FFF-out` from a Fluent journal file?",
    "answer": "The command `/file/write-case-data FFF-out` is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command allows saving a simulation report to a file (e.g., \"My_Simulation_Report.txt\") in a Fluent journal script?",
    "answer": "The command `/report/summary y \"My_Simulation_Report.txt\"` is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can Fluent be cleanly shut down from within a journal file?",
    "answer": "By using the `/exit` or `exit` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the `sample2.jou` example, how often are data files automatically saved?",
    "answer": "Data files are automatically saved every 100 iterations, as indicated by `/file/auto-save/data-frequency 100`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many most recent data files are retained by the auto-save function in the `sample2.jou` example?",
    "answer": "The 5 most recent data files are retained, as set by `/file/auto-save/retain-most-recent-files y`."
  },
  {
    "question": "In `sample2.jou`, what is the root name for automatically saved data files?",
    "answer": "The root name is `output/FFF-out`, which appends the iteration number."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command sets the physical time step size to 0.0001 in a transient Fluent simulation journal file?",
    "answer": "The command is `/solve/set/time-step 0.0001`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the reporting interval for convergence monitors set to 1 in a transient simulation journal file like `sample3.jou`?",
    "answer": "It is set using the command `/solve/set/reporting-interval 1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to initialize the flow using the hybrid method in the `sample3.jou` example?",
    "answer": "The command is `/solve/initialize/hyb-initialization`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are dual-time iterations and maximum iterations per time step specified in a transient Fluent journal file, as shown in `sample3.jou`?",
    "answer": "They are specified using `/solve/dual-time-iterate 1000 75`, where 1000 is the number of time steps and 75 is the maximum iterations per time step."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the initial step for using a User-Defined Function (UDF) on the cluster?",
    "answer": "The first step is to transfer your UDF source file (e.g., `sampleudf.c`) and any additional dependency files to the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should the UDF file be placed on the cluster?",
    "answer": "The UDF must be placed in the same directory where your journal, case, and data files reside."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an important consideration when transferring a UDF from a Windows machine to a Linux-based cluster?",
    "answer": "You must ensure that the text mode of your transfer client is used, otherwise Fluent may not be able to read the file correctly on the Linux cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Before submitting a job that uses an interpreted or compiled UDF via a journal file, what should be verified in Fluent's GUI?",
    "answer": "You should verify that the `Interpreted UDFs` and `UDF Library Manager` dialogs are not configured to use a UDF, to ensure only journal file commands have control during job submission."
