    "question": "What account types can be used for a JupyterHub session?",
    "answer": "A user can utilize any `def-*`, `rrg-*`, `rpp-*`, or `ctb-*` account they have access to."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some of the configurable options for a JupyterHub session?",
    "answer": "Configurable options include the account to be used, time in hours for the session, number of CPU cores, memory (MB) limit, optional GPU configuration (at least one GPU), and the user interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many Jupyter servers can a user utilize at a time on each hub via JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "JupyterHub allows each user to use one Jupyter server at a time on each hub."
  },
  {
    "question": "What user interface options are available in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "The available user interface options are JupyterLab (modern interface), Jupyter Notebook (classic interface), and Terminal (for a single terminal only)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Jupyter user interface is recommended for interactive prototyping and data visualization?",
    "answer": "JupyterLab (modern interface) is the most recommended Jupyter user interface for interactive prototyping and data visualization."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the Terminal user interface in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "The Terminal user interface gives access to a terminal connected to a remote account, which is comparable to connecting to a server through an SSH connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can JupyterHub be configured to enforce a specific user interface?",
    "answer": "Yes, JupyterHub could be configured to force a specific user interface, which is usually done for special events."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes most 'Spawn failed: Timeout' errors in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "Most JupyterHub errors, particularly 'Spawn failed: Timeout', are caused by the underlying job scheduler being either unresponsive or unable to find appropriate resources for your session."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does JupyterHub wait for an interactive job to start before cancelling the session with a 'Timeout' error?",
    "answer": "If the interactive job does not start within five minutes, a 'Timeout' error message is raised and the session is cancelled."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors can contribute to a longer wait time for a JupyterHub session to start?",
    "answer": "A longer requested time, requesting a GPU, or requesting too many CPU cores can cause a longer wait time. Additionally, having another interactive job running on the same cluster will cause your Jupyter session to wait in the queue."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if their JupyterHub session fails to spawn because they already have another interactive job running?",
    "answer": "If possible, the user should stop or cancel any other interactive job before using JupyterHub."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does an 'Authentication error: Error 403' signify in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "An 'Authentication error: Error 403' indicates that your account or your access to the cluster is currently inactive."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user resolve an 'Authentication error: Error 403'?",
    "answer": "To resolve an 'Authentication error: Error 403', the user must make sure their account is active (it has been renewed) and that their access to the cluster is enabled."
