    "question": "What server options can a user set for a JupyterHub session on B\u00e9luga?",
    "answer": "Users can specify the 'Account', 'Time (hours)' for the session, 'Number of (CPU) cores' to be reserved, 'Memory (MB)' limit, and optionally 'GPU configuration' (at least one GPU), and the 'User interface'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the available user interface options in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "JupyterHub offers multiple user interface options: JupyterLab (modern interface), Jupyter Notebook (classic interface), and Terminal (for a single terminal)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Jupyter user interface is most recommended and why?",
    "answer": "JupyterLab is the most recommended user interface for interactive prototyping and data visualization, as the community is moving towards it due to its better platform and more features compared to Jupyter Notebook."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the Terminal interface in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "The Terminal interface gives access to a terminal connected to a remote account, similar to an SSH connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can JupyterHub be configured to use a specific user interface?",
    "answer": "Yes, JupyterHub can be configured to force a specific user interface, usually for special events."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes most JupyterHub errors?",
    "answer": "Most JupyterHub errors are caused by the underlying job scheduler being unresponsive or unable to find appropriate resources for the session."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a 'Spawn failed: Timeout' error message mean in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "A 'Timeout' error means that the interactive job submitted by JupyterHub on your behalf did not start within five minutes, leading to the session being cancelled."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors can contribute to a longer wait time for a JupyterHub session and potentially cause a 'Timeout' error?",
    "answer": "A longer requested time, requesting a GPU, or asking for too many CPU cores can all cause a longer wait time. Also, if you already have another interactive job on the same cluster, your Jupyter session will wait longer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps can be taken to resolve a 'Spawn failed: Timeout' error?",
    "answer": "Request only the resources you need, stop or cancel any other interactive job you might have on the same cluster, and check the Alliance status page for any issues, then try again later if no resources are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes an 'Authentication error: Error 403' in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "This error indicates that your account or your access to the cluster is currently inactive."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an 'Authentication error: Error 403' be resolved?",
    "answer": "To resolve this error, ensure your account has been renewed and is active, and confirm that your access to the specific cluster is enabled."
