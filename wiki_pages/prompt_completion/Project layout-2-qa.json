  {
    "question": "What is the typical directory structure for users like Sue and Bob?",
    "answer": "Users typically have `/home/user/scratch` (a symbolic link) and `/home/user/projects` (a directory)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do the `scratch` symbolic links point for individual users?",
    "answer": "The `scratch` link points to a location specific to the user, for example, `/scratch/sue` for Sue and `/scratch/bob` for Bob."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to Bob's `projects` directory if he is only sponsored by Sue?",
    "answer": "If Bob's only role is sponsored by Sue, his `projects` directory would have the same contents as Sue's `projects` directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What subdirectory would typically be found in the `projects` directory if neither Sue nor Bob have any other roles or projects with Alliance?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, each one's `projects` directory would just contain one subdirectory, `def-sue`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do `/home/sue/projects/def-sue` and `/home/bob/projects/def-sue` point?",
    "answer": "Both `/home/sue/projects/def-sue` and `/home/bob/projects/def-sue` would point to the same location, `/project/<some random number>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended location for Sue and Bob to share data?",
    "answer": "The project directory, pointed to by `def-sue`, is the best place for Sue and Bob to share data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can Sue and Bob share data within their shared project directory?",
    "answer": "They can both create directories in it, read it, and write to it. For instance, Sue could create a directory and Bob could then copy a file into it, making it visible to both."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to a user's `projects` directory if they receive a RAC award with storage?",
    "answer": "If a user receives a RAC award, a new entry, such as `~/projects/rrg-sue-ab`, will appear in their respective `projects` directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which directory should be used to store data related to a RAC award?",
    "answer": "The new entry in the `projects` directory, like `~/projects/rrg-sue-ab`, should be used to store and share data related to the research carried out under the RAC award."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the simplest way to share data with someone who is not sponsored by the PI, like Heather?",
    "answer": "The simplest way is to change the file permissions so that Heather can read a particular directory or file, often by using ACLs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can filesystem permissions be changed only in the `project` space?",
    "answer": "No, filesystem permissions can be changed for almost any directory or file, including those in your `scratch` space or specific subdirectories of `projects`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is considered best practice for restricting file sharing?",
    "answer": "Best practice is to restrict file sharing to `/project` and `/scratch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What permissions does Heather need on directories to access a shared file deeper in the filesystem structure?",
    "answer": "Heather will need to have read and execute permission on each of the directories between the top-level shared directory (e.g., `~/projects/def-sue`) and the directory containing the file(s) to be shared."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can data be shared with researchers who do not have an Alliance account?",
    "answer": "Yes, data can be shared with researchers who don't have an Alliance account using a Globus shared endpoint."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a natural next step if Heather is pursuing a serious and ongoing collaboration with Sue?",
    "answer": "It may make sense for Sue to sponsor a role for Heather, thereby giving Heather access similar to Bob's."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of `scratch` space?",
    "answer": "`scratch` space is intended for (private) temporary files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is `home` space typically used for?",
    "answer": "`home` space is normally used for small amounts of relatively private data, such as a job script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of data should normally go into a group's `project` space?",
    "answer": "Shared data for a research group should normally go into that group's `project` space."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics of `project` space for a research group?",
    "answer": "Project space is persistent, backed up, and fairly large (up to 10 TB, or more with a RAC)."
