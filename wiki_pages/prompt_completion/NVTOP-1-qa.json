  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to monitor an interactive job's GPU usage with NVTOP?",
    "answer": "First, start your interactive job with minimal resources. In a second terminal, connect to the login node, find the job ID using `sq`, and then attach to the running job with `srun --pty --jobid JOBID nvtop`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you monitor a GPU on a specific node when running multi-node jobs?",
    "answer": "From a login node, find the job ID using `sq` and identify the node names with `srun --jobid JOBID -n1 -c1 scontrol show hostname`, then attach to the running job on the specific node using `srun --pty --jobid JOBiD --nodelist NODENAME nvtop`."
