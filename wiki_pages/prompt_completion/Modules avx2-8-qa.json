  {
    "question": "What is Barracuda?",
    "answer": "Barracuda is a high-speed sequence aligner based on Sanger's BWA, which uses the latest Nvidia CUDA architecture to accelerate alignments of sequence reads generated by next-generation sequencers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Barrnap used for?",
    "answer": "Barrnap predicts the location of ribosomal RNA genes in genomes, supporting bacteria, archaea, metazoan mitochondria, and eukaryotes. It takes FASTA DNA sequence as input and writes GFF3 as output, utilizing the nhmmer tool from HMMER 3.1 for HMM searching."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is BayesAss used for?",
    "answer": "BayesAss is a Bayesian Inference of Recent Migration tool that uses Multilocus Genotypes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is BayesAss3-SNPs?",
    "answer": "BayesAss3-SNPs is a modification of BayesAss 3.0.4 that allows handling of large SNP datasets generated via methods like RADseq protocols. It removes the upper limit of 420 loci that previously caused segmentation faults in BayesAss."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is BayeScan designed to do?",
    "answer": "BayeScan aims to identify candidate loci under natural selection from genetic data by analyzing differences in allele frequencies between populations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is BayPass software used for?",
    "answer": "BayPass is a population genomics software primarily used for identifying genetic markers subjected to selection and/or associated with population-specific covariates like environmental variables or phenotypic characteristics."
