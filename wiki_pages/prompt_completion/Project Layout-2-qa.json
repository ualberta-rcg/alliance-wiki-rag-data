  {
    "question": "What is the typical directory structure for users like Sue and Bob?",
    "answer": "Users like Sue and Bob typically have a symbolic link `/home/[username]/scratch` and a directory `/home/[username]/projects`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do the `scratch` symbolic links point for users like Sue and Bob?",
    "answer": "The `scratch` link points to a unique location for each user, such as `/scratch/sue` for Sue and `/scratch/bob` for Bob."
  },
  {
    "question": "What would Bob's `projects` directory contain if his only role is sponsored by Sue and neither has other Alliance projects?",
    "answer": "If Bob's only role is sponsored by Sue and neither has other Alliance projects, Bob's `projects` directory would have the same contents as Sue's, containing one subdirectory, `def-sue`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do `def-sue` directories (e.g., `/home/sue/projects/def-sue`) point?",
    "answer": "Both `/home/sue/projects/def-sue` and `/home/bob/projects/def-sue` point to the same location, `/project/<some random number>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the `def-sue` project directory for Sue and Bob?",
    "answer": "The `def-sue` project directory is the best place for Sue and Bob to share data, as they can both create directories in it, read it, and write to it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to Sue's and Bob's `projects` directory if Sue gets a RAC award with storage?",
    "answer": "If Sue gets a RAC award with storage, both she and Bob would find a new entry in their respective `projects` directory, such as `~/projects/rrg-sue-ab`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should Sue and Bob use the `~/projects/rrg-sue-ab` directory for?",
    "answer": "They should use this directory to store and share data related to the research carried out under the RAC award."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the simplest way to share data with someone not sponsored by the PI, like Heather?",
    "answer": "The simplest way to share data with someone not sponsored by the PI is to change the file permissions so that they can read a particular directory or file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is considered the 'best idea' for allowing someone like Heather to read a directory?",
    "answer": "The best idea is usually to use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to let Heather read a directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can filesystem permissions be changed for sharing purposes?",
    "answer": "Filesystem permissions can be changed for almost any directory or file, not just those in your `project` space; you could share a directory in your `scratch` or a particular subdirectory of `projects`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the best practice for restricting file sharing?",
    "answer": "Best practice is to restrict file sharing to `/project` and `/scratch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What permissions does Heather need on the filesystem structure to access a shared directory?",
    "answer": "Heather will need to have read and execute permission on each of the directories between `~/projects/def-sue` and the directory containing the file(s) to be shared."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can data be shared with researchers who do not have an Alliance account?",
    "answer": "Yes, data can be shared with researchers who don't have an Alliance account using a Globus shared endpoint."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might it make sense for a PI to sponsor a role for a collaborator like Heather?",
    "answer": "If Heather is pursuing a serious and ongoing collaboration with Sue, it may naturally make sense for Sue to sponsor a role for Heather, thereby giving Heather similar access to Bob's."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of `scratch` space?",
    "answer": "`scratch` space is for private temporary files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is `home` space typically used for?",
    "answer": "`home` space is normally used for small amounts of relatively private data, such as a job script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is `project` space used for, and what are its characteristics?",
    "answer": "`project` space is normally used for shared data for a research group, as it is persistent, backed up, and fairly large (up to 10 TB, or more with a RAC)."
