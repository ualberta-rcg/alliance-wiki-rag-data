  {
    "question": "When are whole nodes recommended for parallel computations?",
    "answer": "Whole nodes are recommended for parallel computations that can efficiently use 32 cores or more."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a specific reservation for tasks requiring one or more whole nodes?",
    "answer": "Yes, a portion of each cluster is reserved for tasks necessitating one or more entire nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more information and script examples about whole nodes?",
    "answer": "More information and script examples are available in the 'N\u0153uds entiers' section of the 'Contr\u00f4le de l'ordonnancement avec MPI' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is considered an unjustified abuse of resources when requesting whole nodes?",
    "answer": "Requesting an inefficient number of processors simply to gain whole node scheduling advantages is considered an unjustified abuse of resources. Misusing memory capacity when submitting whole node tasks is also deemed inappropriate."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should a task be requested if a program performs similarly on 16 or 32 cores?",
    "answer": "The request should typically be for `--ntasks=16` rather than `--nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=32`, unless the specific goal is to have all tasks run on the same node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tools are suggested for combining a large number of serial tasks onto a single node?",
    "answer": "Users are encouraged to use tools like GNU Parallel, GLOST, or other techniques to gather a large quantity of serial tasks onto a single node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum execution time for tasks on the Trillium cluster?",
    "answer": "Trillium can accommodate tasks with execution times of up to 24 hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum execution time for tasks on Fir, Narval, Nibi, and Rorqual clusters?",
    "answer": "The maximum execution time for tasks on Fir, Narval, Nibi, and Rorqual is 7 days."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the maximum task durations fixed and permanent?",
    "answer": "No, these durations are at the discretion of system administrators and are subject to change."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are tasks with varying execution times managed on general-purpose clusters?",
    "answer": "General-purpose clusters use partitioning, so tasks with long durations can only use a portion of the cluster. Partitions exist for tasks lasting 3 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, or 7 days or less."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do shorter tasks have a scheduling advantage over longer tasks?",
    "answer": "Yes, a shorter task is more likely to be scheduled quicker than a longer task with otherwise identical characteristics because shorter tasks can run in partitions with longer maximum durations and benefit from backfilling."
  },
  {
    "question": "What mechanism does the scheduler use to optimize resource utilization?",
    "answer": "The scheduler optimizes resource utilization through backfilling."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does backfilling improve resource utilization compared to strict priority scheduling?",
    "answer": "Without backfilling, partitions are scheduled strictly by priority, which typically minimizes resource utilization. Backfilling allows lower-priority tasks to launch without delaying higher-priority ones, optimizing usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required for the backfilling technique to function effectively?",
    "answer": "The effective operation of backfilling requires reasonably accurate maximum execution times, as the projected launch time for pending tasks depends on the completion of current tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which tasks are advantaged by backfilling?",
    "answer": "Backfilling advantages tasks with shorter maximum durations, specifically those less than 3 hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "What general-purpose clusters are mentioned in the description of node partitioning?",
    "answer": "The general-purpose clusters mentioned are Fir, Narval, Nibi, and Rorqual."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of node categories are described for general-purpose clusters?",
    "answer": "The described node categories include 'base' type nodes (4 to 8GB of memory per core), 'large' type nodes (16 to 96GB of memory per core), and 'GPU base' type nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are submitted tasks directed to the appropriate node category?",
    "answer": "Submitted tasks are directed to the appropriate node category based on the resources they require."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are partitions called when a task uses only a few cores or a single core on a node?",
    "answer": "These partitions are referred to as 'par n\u0153ud' (by-node) and 'par c\u0153ur' (by-core)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a task's real execution time affect its access to resources?",
    "answer": "The real execution time plays a role; shorter tasks have access to more resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a task requiring less than 3 hours of execution time run on a node designated for 12-hour tasks?",
    "answer": "Yes, a task requiring less than 3 hours of real execution time can run on any node that permits real times of up to 12 hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do all nodes that accept 3-hour tasks also accept 12-hour tasks?",
    "answer": "No, some nodes that accept tasks with a 3-hour maximum duration will not accept tasks requiring up to 12 hours."
