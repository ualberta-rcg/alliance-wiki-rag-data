    "question": "What is SSW software?",
    "answer": "SSW is a fast implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, which uses Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) instructions to parallelize the algorithm at the instruction level. It provides an API and can directly perform protein and genome alignment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key features of the SSW library?",
    "answer": "The SSW library offers a fast implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm using SIMD instructions, providing an API for C, C++, and other languages. It is approximately 50 times faster than an ordinary Smith-Waterman implementation and can accurately return the Smith-Waterman score, alignment location, and traceback path (cigar) of the optimal alignment, as well as heuristically the sub-optimal alignment score and location."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of SSW are available?",
    "answer": "Available versions for SSW are 1.1 and 1.2.5."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the homepage for the SSW library?",
    "answer": "The homepage for the SSW library is https://github.com/mengyao/Complete-Striped-Smith-Waterman-Library."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Stacks software used for?",
    "answer": "Stacks is a software pipeline designed for building loci from short-read sequences, such as those generated on the Illumina platform. It is particularly useful for restriction enzyme-based data like RAD-seq, to build genetic maps and conduct population genomics and phylogeography studies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of analyses can be performed with Stacks?",
    "answer": "Stacks can be used for building genetic maps, population genomics, and phylogeography studies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the available versions of the Stacks software?",
    "answer": "Available versions of Stacks include 2.53, 2.55, 2.57, 2.59, 2.60, 2.62, 2.64, 2.66, and 2.67."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more information about Stacks?",
    "answer": "More information about Stacks can be found on its homepage at http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/."

  {
    "question": "What is the function of the STAR aligner?",
    "answer": "STAR aligns RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using uncompressed suffix arrays."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of STAR are available?",
    "answer": "Available versions for STAR include 2.7.5a, 2.7.8a, 2.7.9a, 2.7.11a, and 2.7.11b."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage for the STAR software?",
    "answer": "The homepage for the STAR software is https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is STAR-Fusion?",
    "answer": "STAR-Fusion is a tool that identifies candidate fusion transcripts supported by Illumina reads, using the STAR aligner. It further processes the output from STAR to map junction reads and spanning reads to a reference annotation set."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the current version of STAR-Fusion?",
    "answer": "The current version of STAR-Fusion is 1.10.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the STAR-Fusion homepage?",
    "answer": "The homepage for STAR-Fusion is https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some of the extensions used by STAR-Fusion?",
    "answer": "Some extensions used by STAR-Fusion include AutoLoader-5.74, Carp::Assert-0.21, common::sense-3.74, constant-1.33, Cwd-3.75, Data::Dumper-2.173, DB_File-1.852, Encode-3.01, ExtUtils::CBuilder-0.280231, ExtUtils::CppGuess-0.19, ExtUtils::MakeMaker-7.36, ExtUtils::ParseXS-3.35, IO::File-1.39, IO::Select-1.39, IO::Socket-1.39, IPC::Cmd-1.02, JSON::XS-4.02, List::Util-1.50, Locale::Maketext::Simple-0.21, MIME::Base64-3.15, Module::CoreList-5.20190620, Module::Load-0.34, Module::Load::Conditional-0.68, Module::Metadata-1.000036, Net::Domain-3.11, Params::Check-0.38, parent-0.237, Perl::OSType-1.010, PerlIO::gzip-0.20, Pod::Escapes-1.07, Pod::Man-4.12, Pod::Simple-3.39, Scalar::Util-1.50, Set::IntervalTree-0.12, Socket-2.029, Storable-3.15, Test-1.26, Test::More-1.302164, Text::ParseWords-3.30, Text::Wrap-2013.0523, Time::Local-1.28, Types::Serialiser-1.0, URI::Escape-1.76, and XSLoader-0.24."
