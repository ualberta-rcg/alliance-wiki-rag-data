    "question": "How is the total number of cores (NCORES) calculated in the Ansys Fluent multinode (by node) Trillium Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The total number of cores (NCORES) is calculated as the product of the number of nodes (SLURM_NNODES), tasks per node (SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE), and CPUs per task (SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What error messages might a user encounter in the Ansys Fluent multinode (by node) Trillium Slurm script if certain directories or files are missing?",
    "answer": "Users might see error messages indicating that a link to a writable `.ansys` directory, `.fluentconf` directory, or `.flrecent` file does not exist in their `$HOME` folder."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user resolve the 'ERROR: A link to a writable .ansys directory does not exist' issue when running Ansys Fluent on Trillium?",
    "answer": "To resolve this error, the user should remove `~/.ansys` if it exists, and then run `ln -s $SCRATCH/.ansys ~/.ansys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'License Requeue' scripts for Ansys Fluent jobs?",
    "answer": "The 'License Requeue' scripts are designed for Fluent jobs that are known to complete normally but frequently require multiple attempts to successfully checkout licenses due to shortages."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should 'License Requeue' scripts NOT be used for Ansys Fluent jobs?",
    "answer": "These scripts are not recommended for Fluent jobs that might run for a long time before crashing, or that run to completion but contain unresolved journal file warnings, as simulations would be repeated unnecessarily."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the 'Multinode (by node + requeue)' Slurm script for Ansys Fluent, how is the number of requeue attempts configured?",
    "answer": "The number of requeue attempts is specified using the `#SBATCH --array=1-5%1` directive, where `5` indicates the maximum number of requeue attempts."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the total number of cores (NCORES) determined in the Fluent multinode (by node + requeue) Slurm script?",
    "answer": "NCORES is determined by the calculation `NCORES=$((SLURM_NNODES * SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE * SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK))`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Intel MPI modules are loaded for Narval cluster when using the Fluent multinode (by node + requeue) script?",
    "answer": "For Narval, if `EBVERSIONGENTOO` is 2020, `intel/2021` and `intelmpi` modules are loaded. If `EBVERSIONGENTOO` is 2023, `intel/2023` and `intelmpi` modules are loaded."
