    "question": "What does the 'End of file in GetChg' error typically indicate in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error means that either the charge/multiplicity line was omitted from the input, or the `geom=allcheck` option was forgotten when attempting to read the charge/multiplicity from a checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve the 'End of file in GetChg' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you should either add the charge/multiplicity line to your input or include `geom=allcheck` in the route section if you intended to read it from a checkpoint."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Change in point group or standard orientation' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error occurs during the optimization process when the molecule's standard orientation or its point group changes. Visually, it might appear as the structure flipping by 180 degrees. This specific error has become less frequent since Gaussian 03."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you fix a 'Change in point group or standard orientation' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "Potential fixes include ensuring your z-matrix is correctly specified to avoid undesirable point group changes, desymmetrizing the starting structure if it had excessively high symmetry, reformulating the z-matrix with more symmetry if the detected point group is incorrect, or completely turning off symmetry if it's not a concern."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the reason for an 'Unrecognized atomic symbol' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error usually arises when an atomic symbol specified in a general basis set does not match any standard atomic symbol. It can also occur in a linked job if `geom=modify` is used after default coordinates have reset the z-matrix, leading Gaussian to misinterpret z-matrix variable information as basis set data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an 'Unrecognized atomic symbol' error be corrected?",
    "answer": "To correct this error, you need to type in the correct atomic symbol in your input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Convergence failure -- run terminated' indicate in a Gaussian output?",
    "answer": "This message indicates that the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) procedure failed to converge. This can be due to a poor initial guess for the molecular orbitals, an unfavorable starting geometry, or an issue with the optimizer's steps."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some ways to fix an SCF 'Convergence failure -- run terminated' error?",
    "answer": "You can try several approaches: use a better molecular orbital guess (e.g., `guess=read` from a lower level of theory calculation like HF/STO-3G), employ alternative SCF convergers such as `SCF=QC` or `SCF=XQC`, refine the initial geometry if it's poor, or resubmit the job using an earlier geometry and a newly calculated Hessian."
