    "question": "What alternatives can I use if I encounter graphics issues with VNC?",
    "answer": "If you experience graphics issues with VNC, you can try using OpenOnDemand on the nibi cluster or JupyterHub on the rorqual cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of using OpenOnDemand or JupyterHub for VDI?",
    "answer": "Both OpenOnDemand and JupyterHub offer a fully automated VDI web interface GUI experience designed for ease of use, with improved hardware performance and software support."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I reset my VNC password?",
    "answer": "To reset your VNC password, use the command `vncpasswd` in the terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an alternative method to set a new VNC password?",
    "answer": "You can permanently delete your VNC configuration, including your password, by removing your `~/.vnc` directory. The next time you launch `vncserver`, you will be prompted to define a new password."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I list all active vncservers running under my username?",
    "answer": "You can list all vncservers running under your username (on a login or compute node) using the command `vncserver -list`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I kill a specific active vncserver that is no longer needed?",
    "answer": "If an active vncserver is no longer needed, kill it with `vncserver -kill :DISPLAY#`, replacing `:DISPLAY#` with the actual display number (e.g., `:44`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I kill multiple active vncservers on a node simultaneously?",
    "answer": "If you have several active vncservers on a node, you can kill them all at once with `pkill Xvnc -u $USER`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I enable multiple VNC connections to the same vncserver?",
    "answer": "To allow multiple connections, the vncserver must be started with the additional option `-AlwaysShared`, for example, `vncserver -idletimeout 86400 -alwaysshared`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a vncserver is started with the `-AlwaysShared` option?",
    "answer": "If a vncserver is started with `-AlwaysShared`, multiple connections can be established by creating new tunnels and vncviewers from any remote location, allowing seamless work continuity."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a vncserver is not started with the `-AlwaysShared` option?",
    "answer": "If a vncserver was not started with `-AlwaysShared`, only a single vncviewer connection will be possible, and additional connection attempts will fail immediately."
  },
  {
    "question": "What could cause repeated VNC connection failures?",
    "answer": "Repeated failures to establish a new vncserver/vncviewer connection could be caused by an existing SSH tunnel on your computer blocking ports."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I identify and terminate SSH tunnels that might be blocking VNC connections?",
    "answer": "To determine the presence of such tunnels and kill them, open a terminal window on your computer and run the command `ps ux | grep ssh` followed by `kill PID` (replacing PID with the process ID)."
