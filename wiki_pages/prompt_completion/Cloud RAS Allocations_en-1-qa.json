  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when Compute instances reach their life-time limit?",
    "answer": "Upon reaching their life-time limit, Compute instances will be scheduled for deactivation, and their owners will be notified to ensure they clean up and download any required data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are Persistent instances primarily used for?",
    "answer": "Persistent instances are meant to run indefinitely and are used for services like Web servers and database servers, generally using less CPU power than compute instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which vGPU type is currently offered by Arbutus for RAS use?",
    "answer": "Arbutus currently offers H100 GPUs in a single flavor for RAS use (g1-12vgb-c3-35gb-125)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the specifications of the 'g1-12vgb-c3-35gb-125' vGPU flavor?",
    "answer": "This flavor has 12GB GPU memory, 3 vCPUs, 35GB of memory, and 125GB of ephemeral storage."

  {
    "question": "What is the instance limit for Persistent instances under RAS?",
    "answer": "The instance limit for Persistent instances under RAS is 10."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'soft quota' in the context of RAS limits?",
    "answer": "A 'soft quota' is a metadata quota, not a hard limit, meaning users can request an increase beyond these values without a RAC request."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Volume limit for Compute instances under RAS?",
    "answer": "The Volume limit for Compute instances under RAS is 2."
  },

    "answer": "The RAM limit for Persistent instances under RAS is 50 GB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Floating IP limit for both Compute and Persistent instances under RAS?",
    "answer": "The Floating IP limit for both Compute and Persistent instances under RAS is 2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the total Persistent storage limit per PI for a single RAS project?",
    "answer": "The Persistent storage limit is 10 TB, shared between compute and persistent allocations for a single project."
