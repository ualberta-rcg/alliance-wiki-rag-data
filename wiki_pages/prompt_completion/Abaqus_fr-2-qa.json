    "question": "What parallelization modes do Abaqus standard analysis solvers support?",
    "answer": "Abaqus standard analysis solvers support parallelization with threads and with MPI."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are restart scripts available for multi-node Abaqus standard analysis tasks?",
    "answer": "No, scripts for restarting a task that uses multiple nodes are not presented for standard analysis for now."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended Slurm account to specify for standard Abaqus analysis jobs?",
    "answer": "The recommended Slurm account to specify is `def-group`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Abaqus version module is loaded in the provided single-node standard analysis script?",
    "answer": "The `abaqus/2021` module is loaded as the latest installed version."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify the number of cores per task in a Slurm script for single-node standard analysis?",
    "answer": "You specify it using `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4` (or your desired number of cores)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Abaqus command used for a single-node standard simulation (job `testsp1`) using threads and scratch data in the temporary directory?",
    "answer": "The command is `abaqus job=testsp1 input=mystd-sim.inp scratch=$SLURM_TMPDIR cpus=$SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE interactive mp_mode=threads memory=\"$((${SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE}-3072))MB\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an input file be configured to write restart data every 12 increments?",
    "answer": "The input file must contain `*RESTART, WRITE, OVERLAY, FREQUENCY=12`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an input file be configured to write restart data for a total of 12 increments?",
    "answer": "The input file must contain `*RESTART, WRITE, OVERLAY, NUMBER INTERVAL=12, TIME MARKS=NO`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to check full restart information for standard analysis jobs?",
    "answer": "You can use `egrep -i \"step|start\" testsp*.com testsp*.msg testsp*.sta`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modification can be added to an Abaqus script to improve certain simulations?",
    "answer": "Adding the Abaqus command `order_parallel=OFF` to the bottom of the script can improve some simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Abaqus command is used to restart a standard analysis job (`testsp2`) from a previous job (`testsp1`) using a restart input file?",
    "answer": "The command is `abaqus job=testsp2 oldjob=testsp1 input=mystd-sim-restart.inp ...`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What must the input file contain for restarting a standard Abaqus analysis?",
    "answer": "The input file for restarting a standard analysis must contain `*HEADING` and `*RESTART, READ`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do the temporary directory scripts for single-node standard analysis ensure data is saved periodically?",
    "answer": "They include a loop `while sleep 6h; do echo \"Saving data due to time limit ...\"; cp -fv * $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR 2>/dev/null; done &` which saves data every 6 hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Slurm parameter specifies the number of nodes for a multi-node Abaqus MPI script?",
    "answer": "The `--nodes` parameter can be uncommented to specify the number of nodes (optional)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the `mp_host_list` generated and used in a multi-node Abaqus MPI script?",
    "answer": "The `mp_host_list` is generated from Slurm's host list using `slurm_hl2hl.py`, then exported as an environment variable and written to `abaqus_v6.env`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the memory offset value hardcoded in the single-node Abaqus command for standard analysis?",
    "answer": "A memory offset value of `3072MB` is subtracted from `SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE`."
