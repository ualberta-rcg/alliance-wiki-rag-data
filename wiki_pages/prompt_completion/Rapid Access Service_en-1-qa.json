    "question": "What is the first step required for PIs and sponsored users to access any computational resource offered by the Alliance?",
    "answer": "The PI and any sponsored user must first request access to the desired system(s) on the page: https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any additional requirements before access to a system can be granted?",
    "answer": "Yes, some systems will require the acceptance of additional agreements, such as Terms of User or SLAs, before access can be granted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a user misses the step of requesting system access?",
    "answer": "If this step is missed, users will not be able to log in to the desired system."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are default storage resources made available to PIs and sponsored users?",
    "answer": "Some storage resources are made available in the Default RAP to PIs and their sponsored users immediately after creating an Alliance account on CCDB, and they are ready for utilization as soon as access to the corresponding system is requested at https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more details about the default storage resources available?",
    "answer": "Users can visit the access systems page (https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_systems) for more details about the storage resources available by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much additional storage can PIs request in General Purpose clusters without a RAC application?",
    "answer": "PIs can request up to a maximum of 40 TB of project storage and 100 TB of nearline storage without submitting a RAC application."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can additional storage resources be split across multiple clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, these resources can be requested all in one cluster or split across multiple ones, but the total amount across all clusters must not exceed 40 TB of project storage or 100 TB of nearline storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which project are resources allocated via RAS available?",
    "answer": "Resources allocated via RAS will be available in the Default Resource Allocation Project (RAP)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the maximum project and nearline storage limits for clusters like Fir, Nibi, Rorqual, and Narval when requested via RAS?",
    "answer": "For Fir, Nibi, Rorqual, and Narval, the maximum project storage is 40 TB across all clusters and the maximum nearline storage is 100 TB across all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is RAS storage available on Trillium or HPSS clusters?",
    "answer": "No, RAS storage is not available on Trillium or HPSS clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can request storage resources via RAS and how should they do it?",
    "answer": "PIs (not sponsored users) must send an email to support@tech.alliancecan.ca with details of the storage resources needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can use CPU resources for opportunistic use?",
    "answer": "CPU resources are available for opportunistic use to all research groups with an active Alliance account."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the average CPU usage target for research groups using their Default RAP?",
    "answer": "Research groups with an Alliance account may be able to use, on average, up to 200 core years on each cluster with their Default RAP."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the 200 core years for CPU usage a fixed cap or reservation?",
    "answer": "No, 200 core years is a variable target; it is not a reservation nor a cap, meaning utilization can vary depending on job characteristics and cluster utilization."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can most research groups meet their CPU needs without applying for a RAC?",
    "answer": "Yes, most research groups are able to meet their need for CPU resources by submitting jobs opportunistically with their Default RAP and without having to apply for the RAC."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might applying for a RAC be the best option for CPU resources?",
    "answer": "Applying for a RAC may be the best option if jobs have large memory requirements and the amount of CPU resources needed exceeds the minimum required to apply."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find information about job scheduling and how CPU usage is charged?",
    "answer": "Users can find this information by reading about Allocations and compute scheduling."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can use GPU resources for opportunistic use?",
    "answer": "GPU resources are available for opportunistic use to all research groups with an active Alliance account."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the demand for GPUs increasing rapidly?",
    "answer": "The demand for GPUs is increasing quickly with the advances in Artificial Intelligence."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the availability of GPU resources remain constant throughout the year?",
    "answer": "No, the availability of GPU resources varies greatly over the year, becoming more limited in periods preceding major conferences."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Alliance guarantee a specific amount of GPU resources for opportunistic use?",
    "answer": "No, Alliance cannot guarantee any amount of resources available to each group for opportunistic use, especially during times of high demand."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a RAC award affect the consistency of GPU resource usage?",
    "answer": "Users with a RAC award should be able to consistently use their allocated amount of GPU resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can access to cloud resources be requested?",
    "answer": "Access to modest amounts of cloud resources can be requested at any time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do PIs request cloud resources?",
    "answer": "PIs must complete a specific Google Form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU_BoRk5cEz3AvVLf3e9yZJq-OvcFCQ-mg7p4AWXmUkd5rTw/viewform) with details about the cloud resources needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can users other than PIs be granted access to cloud resources?",
    "answer": "Yes, other users with an Alliance account may also be granted access to these resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted for questions or help with RAS cloud resources?",
    "answer": "For questions about accessing RAS cloud resources or needing help, please contact cloud@tech.alliancecan.ca."
