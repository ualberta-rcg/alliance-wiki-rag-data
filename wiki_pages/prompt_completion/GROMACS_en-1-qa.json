  {
    "question": "What is GROMACS used for?",
    "answer": "GROMACS is a versatile package for performing molecular dynamics simulations for systems ranging from hundreds to millions of particles."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what types of molecules is GROMACS primarily designed?",
    "answer": "GROMACS is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which involve complicated bonded interactions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is GROMACS also used for non-biological systems?",
    "answer": "GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating nonbonded interactions, which usually dominate simulations, making it suitable for non-biological systems like polymers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is one of the main strengths of GROMACS?",
    "answer": "GROMACS provides extremely high performance compared to all other programs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Since which version does GROMACS offer CUDA-based GPU acceleration?",
    "answer": "GROMACS has offered CUDA-based GPU acceleration since version 4.6."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum Nvidia compute capability required for GROMACS GPU acceleration?",
    "answer": "GROMACS GPU acceleration requires GPUs with Nvidia compute capability >= 2.0 (e.g., Fermi or later)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does GROMACS support parallel execution?",
    "answer": "GROMACS can be run in parallel using either the standard MPI communication protocol or its own 'Thread MPI' library for single-node workstations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what license is GROMACS available?",
    "answer": "GROMACS is free software available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some weak points of GROMACS?",
    "answer": "Weak points include limited on-the-fly analysis for very high speeds, potential difficulty in reproducing older version results with newer versions, and sometimes lower quality or poorly documented additional tools."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you tell if a GROMACS version has GPU support compiled in?",
    "answer": "The top part of any GROMACS log file will describe the configuration, including whether GPU support is compiled in."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the importance of the 'cutoff-scheme' variable in GROMACS for GPU acceleration?",
    "answer": "For GPU acceleration, the 'cutoff-scheme' variable in the mdp file must be set to 'verlet'. Older versions (before 4.6) used 'group'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default 'cutoff-scheme' in GROMACS version 5.0 and later?",
    "answer": "The default 'cutoff-scheme' in GROMACS version 5.0 and later is 'verlet'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the `gromacs/2024.4` module for CPU execution under `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "You can load it by running: `module load StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 openmpi/4.1.5 gromacs/2024.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are needed to run `gromacs/2024.4` with GPU acceleration under `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "You need to load `StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 openmpi/4.1.5 cuda/12.2 gromacs/2024.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the `gromacs/2023.2` module for CPU execution under `StdEnv/2020`?",
    "answer": "You can load it by running: `module load StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 openmpi/4.0.3 gromacs/2023.2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are needed to run `gromacs/2023.2` with GPU acceleration under `StdEnv/2020`?",
    "answer": "You need to load `StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 cuda/11.4 openmpi/4.0.3 gromacs/2023.2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are GPU-enabled GROMACS versions typically single or double precision?",
    "answer": "GPU-enabled GROMACS versions are typically available only with single precision."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which module must be loaded first when preparing to run a GPU-enabled GROMACS version?",
    "answer": "The `cuda` module needs to be loaded first when preparing to run a GPU-enabled GROMACS version."
  },
  {
    "question": "What compiler and libraries are used for `gromacs/2024.4` in `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "For `gromacs/2024.4` in `StdEnv/2023`, GCC, FlexiBLAS, and FFTW are used."
