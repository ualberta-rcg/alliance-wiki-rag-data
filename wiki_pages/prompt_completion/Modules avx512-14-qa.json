  {
    "question": "What is Bracken?",
    "answer": "Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN) is a highly accurate statistical method that computes the abundance of species in DNA sequences from a metagenomics sample."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Bracken estimate species abundance?",
    "answer": "Bracken uses taxonomy labels assigned by Kraken, a metagenomics classification algorithm, to estimate the number of reads originating from each species in a sample. It combines this information with probabilities derived from the Kraken database about sequence identity to estimate abundance at species, genus, or higher levels."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of Kraken in Bracken?",
    "answer": "Kraken classifies reads to the best matching location in the taxonomic tree, and Bracken uses these taxonomy labels along with the Kraken database to estimate species abundance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What levels of abundance estimates can Bracken provide?",
    "answer": "Bracken can estimate abundance at the species level, genus level, or above."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Bracken compatible with different versions of Kraken?",
    "answer": "Yes, Bracken is compatible with both Kraken 1 and Kraken 2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kmer length should be specified when using Bracken with Kraken 1?",
    "answer": "If using Kraken 1 defaults with Bracken, specify 31 as the kmer length."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kmer length should be used with Bracken if Kraken 2 defaults are applied?",
    "answer": "If using Kraken 2 defaults with Bracken, specify 35 as the kmer length."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of Bracken are available?",
    "answer": "Available versions of Bracken are 2.6.0, 2.7, and 3.0."
  },

    "question": "What kind of algorithm is Brotli?",
    "answer": "Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm."
  },
  {
    "question": "What techniques does Brotli use for compression?",
    "answer": "Brotli compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding, and 2nd order context modeling."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Brotli's compression speed compare to deflate?",
    "answer": "Brotli is similar in speed to deflate but offers more dense compression."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the specification for the Brotli Compressed Data Format?",
    "answer": "The specification for the Brotli Compressed Data Format is defined in RFC 7932."
  },
  {
