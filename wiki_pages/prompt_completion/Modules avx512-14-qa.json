  {
    "question": "What is Bracken?",
    "answer": "Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN) is a highly accurate statistical method that computes the abundance of species in DNA sequences from a metagenomics sample."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Bracken work?",
    "answer": "Bracken uses taxonomy labels assigned by Kraken, a metagenomics classification algorithm, to estimate the number of reads originating from each species in a sample. It combines information from the Kraken database to derive probabilities and estimate abundance at species, genus, or higher levels."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of Bracken are available?",
    "answer": "Bracken versions 2.6.0, 2.7, and 3.0 are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Bracken compatible with Kraken 1 and Kraken 2?",
    "answer": "Yes, Bracken is compatible with both Kraken 1 and Kraken 2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended kmer length for Bracken when using Kraken 1 defaults?",
    "answer": "When using Kraken 1 defaults with Bracken, specify 31 as the kmer length."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended kmer length for Bracken when using Kraken 2 defaults?",
    "answer": "When using Kraken 2 defaults with Bracken, specify 35 as the kmer length."

  {
    "question": "What is breseq used for?",
    "answer": "breseq is a computational pipeline designed for the analysis of short-read re-sequencing data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of breseq are available?",
    "answer": "breseq versions 0.35.2, 0.36.1, and 0.38.2 are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is brotli?",
    "answer": "Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that uses a combination of a modern LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding, and 2nd order context modeling."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics of brotli's compression?",
    "answer": "Brotli offers a compression ratio comparable to the best general-purpose compression methods and is similar in speed to deflate, but provides denser compression."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the specification for the Brotli Compressed Data Format?",
    "answer": "The specification for the Brotli Compressed Data Format is defined in RFC 7932."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of brotli is available?",
    "answer": "Brotli version 1.0.9 is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is brunsli?",
    "answer": "Brunsli is a lossless JPEG repacking library."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of brunsli is available?",
    "answer": "Brunsli version 0.1 is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is btllib?",
    "answer": "btllib is a common code library from the Bioinformatics Technology Lab."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of btllib is available?",
    "answer": "btllib version 1.6.2 is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the NCEPLIBS-bufr library?",
    "answer": "The NCEPLIBS-bufr library contains routines and utilities for working with the WMO BUFR format and is part of the NCEPLIBS project."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of the bufr library is available?",
    "answer": "The bufr library version 12.0.1 is available."
