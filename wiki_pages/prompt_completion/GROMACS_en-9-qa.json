    "question": "What are GROMACS tools used for?",
    "answer": "GROMACS contains a large number of tools that can be used for common tasks of post-processing and analysis of molecular dynamics simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find a list of available GROMACS commands?",
    "answer": "The GROMACS manual contains a list of available commands organized by topic and by name, providing short descriptions and links to their reference."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file formats do GROMACS analysis tools typically read for trajectories and coordinates?",
    "answer": "GROMACS analysis tools typically read trajectories in XTC, TNG, or TRR format, and coordinate files in GRO, PDB, or TPR format."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what format do GROMACS analysis tools write plots?",
    "answer": "GROMACS analysis tools write plots in the XVG format."
  },
  {
    "question": "What plotting tool can open XVG files generated by GROMACS?",

  {
    "question": "What is VMD and what is its purpose?",
    "answer": "VMD is a molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems using 3-D graphics and built-in scripting."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can VMD be used from the command line?",
    "answer": "Yes, VMD can also be used in command line mode."

  {
    "question": "Which Python packages are provided for GROMACS analysis?",
    "answer": "MDAnalysis and MDTraj are two Python packages provided as precompiled Python wheels for GROMACS analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the capabilities of MDAnalysis and MDTraj?",
    "answer": "MDAnalysis and MDTraj can read and write trajectory and coordinate files of GROMACS (TRR and XTC) and many other MD packages, and they include a variety of commonly used analysis functions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does MDAnalysis fully support topology information from all GROMACS TPR files?",
    "answer": "MDAnalysis can read topology information from GROMACS TPR files, though often not those created by the latest versions of GROMACS."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Python packages like MDAnalysis and MDTraj help with custom analysis?",
    "answer": "Both packages feature a versatile atom-selection language and expose the coordinates of trajectories, making it easy to write custom analysis tools tailored to specific problems and integrate with Python's data-science packages like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and plotting libraries like Matplotlib/Pyplot and Seaborn."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is PLUMED?",
    "answer": "PLUMED is an open source library for free energy calculations in molecular systems which works together with some of the most popular molecular dynamics engines."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are `gromacs-plumed` modules?",
    "answer": "The `gromacs-plumed` modules are versions of GROMACS that have been patched with PLUMED's modifications, allowing them to run meta-dynamics simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are needed to run `gromacs-plumed/2023.5` on CPUs using `StdEnv/2023`?",
