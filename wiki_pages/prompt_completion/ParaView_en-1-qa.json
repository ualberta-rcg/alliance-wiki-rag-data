  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of remote visualization with ParaView on the clusters?",
    "answer": "The primary purpose is to describe remote visualization of your dataset residing on one of the Alliance's HPC clusters using ParaView."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three main workflow scenarios for remote visualization described in the document?",
    "answer": "The three main workflow scenarios are: small-scale interactive visualization, large-scale interactive visualization using a client-server setup, and batch production visualizations."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should I choose the 'Small-scale interactive' workflow?",
    "answer": "You should choose the 'Small-scale interactive' workflow if your dataset is only a few GBs (either the entire dataset or each timestep in a time-dependent simulation) and you want to visualize it interactively using a small number of CPU cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is small-scale interactive visualization typically performed?",
    "answer": "It is performed by starting a remote desktop session through JupyterHub or Open OnDemand (depending on the cluster) and running ParaView interactively inside it."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the client-server setup recommended for ParaView visualization?",
    "answer": "A client-server setup is recommended for interactively visualizing larger datasets, where the ParaView client runs on your computer and the server runs in parallel inside a Slurm job on the HPC cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What determines a 'large' dataset on Trillium for client-server visualization?",
    "answer": "On Trillium, a dataset of 50\u2013100 GB is considered 'large' to efficiently utilize whole-node jobs in multiples of 192 cores, which are the only ones allowed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do other clusters like Fir, Narval, Nibi, and Rorqual handle 'large' datasets differently than Trillium?",
    "answer": "On Fir, Narval, Nibi, and Rorqual, you can schedule by core, making it possible to visualize much smaller datasets (even on a single core), although using more cores in parallel speeds up rendering."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is JupyterHub or Open OnDemand recommended for smaller datasets before attempting a client-server configuration?",
    "answer": "JupyterHub or Open OnDemand is generally recommended for smaller datasets because the client-server setup is more complex."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for production visualizations, such as generating many frames for a movie?",
    "answer": "Ideally, production visualizations should be scripted and run as batch, off-screen jobs on the clusters, without interactive windows, rendering directly to files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do interactive GUI workflows (small-scale or large-scale) contribute to batch production visualizations?",
    "answer": "Interactive GUI workflows should be considered as steps to set up your visualization and save it as a ParaView Python script, which can then be executed as a batch job."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the clusters' H100 GPUs recommended for ParaView visualization?",
    "answer": "No, you should not use the clusters' H100 GPUs for visualization, as they are not optimized for graphics rendering."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the drawbacks of using H100 GPUs for ParaView visualization?",
    "answer": "H100 cards utilize only about 3% of their on-board thread controllers for OpenGL and Vulkan, resulting in poor cluster utilization and rendering speeds comparable to a mid-range laptop GPU. Also, MIG instances cannot run graphics APIs."
  },
  {
    "question": "If GPU rendering is absolutely necessary, which alternatives are suggested?",
    "answer": "If GPU rendering is absolutely necessary, it is suggested to use Nibi's AMD MI300A nodes or older NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., T4) where available."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I determine which workflow type to use?",
    "answer": "You should use the tabs provided on the page to select your visualization workflow type."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which clusters use JupyterLab for small-scale interactive visualization, and which use Open OnDemand?",
    "answer": "Fir, Rorqual, and Narval use JupyterLab, while Nibi and Trillium use Open OnDemand for small-scale interactive visualization."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to launch a single-core visualization via JupyterLab on Fir, Rorqual, or Narval?",
    "answer": "The first step is to sign in to JupyterHub on one of these clusters with your Alliance account."
  },
  {
    "question": "When configuring JupyterHub Server Options for single-core visualization, what should be selected for 'GPU configuration' and 'Number of Cores'?",
    "answer": "For 'GPU configuration', select 'None', and for 'Number of Cores', select '1'."
