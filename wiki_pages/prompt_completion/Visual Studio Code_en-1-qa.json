  {
    "question": "Why should VS Code be used locally whenever possible?",
    "answer": "VS Code is notable for misbehaving on login nodes, so it should be strictly used locally or configured carefully if remote connection is necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the risks of running or debugging code with VS Code connected to remote systems?",
    "answer": "Running or debugging code with VS Code connected to remote systems will execute code on the login nodes, which can lead to performance issues or system disruptions."

  {
    "question": "What environment should be used for debugging tasks instead of VS Code connected to remote systems?",
    "answer": "Instead of running or debugging code with VS Code connected to remote systems, the `code-server` environment should be used, as it provides a safer and more appropriate context for debugging tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main recommended approaches for working with files on the systems?",
    "answer": "The recommended approaches are to use VS Code locally and then pull changes onto the systems for testing, use `nano` or `vim` to edit files directly on the systems, or load the `code-server` module for debugging and quick testing."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is configuring VS Code for remote connections permissible?",
    "answer": "Configuring VS Code for remote connections is permissible when local usage, editing with `nano` or `vim`, and using `code-server` are not possible for a specific use case."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of running VS Code locally?",
    "answer": "Benefits of running VS Code locally include speed and stability (fewer network interruptions, faster performance), direct access to files, extensions, and terminals with zero latency, and offline capability (not tied to internet or remote server)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does local VS Code development allow for customization?",
    "answer": "Local VS Code development allows users to customize and extend the IDE with their preferred extensions and language."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the workflow for testing a locally developed project on the systems?",
    "answer": "To test a locally developed project on the systems, save changes to a Git repository, push them to a remote host (like GitHub or GitLab), connect to the system via SSH, and then pull the changes to test."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to connect to a system via the terminal?",
    "answer": "You can connect to a system via the terminal using the command: `ssh <username>@<hostname>.alliancecan.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you clone a Git repository onto the system if it doesn't exist yet?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How do you update an existing Git repository on the system with new changes?",
    "answer": "To update an existing Git repository, change directory to your repository (`cd myrepo`) and then pull the changes (`git pull`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should project changes be tested on the systems?",
    "answer": "Project changes should be tested in a short (with minimal resources) interactive job on the systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What terminal-based editors are available for direct file editing on remote systems?",
