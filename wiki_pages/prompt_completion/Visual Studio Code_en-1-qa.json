    "question": "What is Visual Studio Code?",
    "answer": "Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft that can be used for remote development on clusters over SSH."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Visual Studio Code facilitate remote development on clusters?",
    "answer": "Users can run the graphical interface of Visual Studio Code locally on their personal computer while connecting to a cluster where the source code is located, and where debugging and testing operations are executed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary focus of this page regarding Visual Studio Code's use?",
    "answer": "This page focuses on Visual Studio Code's use with Python."

  {
    "question": "What are the resource requirements for editing a Python script in VS Code?",
    "answer": "Editing a Python script or any other text file of reasonable size requires little processing power or memory, making it a very light-weight process."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when Visual Studio Code executes Python code on a remote server, such as during debugging?",
    "answer": "The IDE executes the Python code on the remote server, and it may consume an entire CPU core or even several if the script or its libraries are multithreaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should users avoid installing when using Visual Studio Code with Python on clusters?",
    "answer": "Users should avoid installing Conda and its variants, as they are poorly adapted to the cluster environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended alternatives to Conda for Python development with Visual Studio Code on clusters?",
    "answer": "Alternatives to Conda include Python virtual environments and Apptainer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step in configuring remote access for VS Code?",
    "answer": "The first step is to generate your SSH key if not already done."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should your public SSH key be installed for remote access?",
    "answer": "Your public SSH key should be installed on CCDB and copied to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it necessary to copy the public SSH key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote cluster?",
    "answer": "This is because compute nodes do not have access to the public keys that are installed on CCDB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file does VS Code use for local SSH configuration?",
    "answer": "VS Code works well with your local SSH configuration file, `~/.ssh/config`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended `ServerAliveInterval` setting in the SSH configuration file?",
    "answer": "The recommended `ServerAliveInterval` is 300."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should a host like 'beluga' be configured in the `~/.ssh/config` file?",
    "answer": "For hosts like beluga, cedar, graham, and narval, the `HostName` should be `%h.alliancecan.ca`, `IdentityFile` should be `~/.ssh/ccdb`, and `User` should be `your_username`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a proxy jump configured for compute nodes in the SSH configuration?",
    "answer": "A `ProxyJump` option can be used, for example, `ProxyJump beluga` for compute nodes like `bc?????`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is a first connection to a login node required in VS Code before connecting to a compute node?",
    "answer": "Because some clusters do not provide internet access from compute nodes, the VS Code Server installation must be done prior to using a remote connection to any compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which login nodes can be used for the first connection in VS Code?",
    "answer": "Beluga, Cedar, Graham, or Narval can be selected for the first connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens automatically during the first connection to a login node in VS Code?",
    "answer": "That first connection will automatically install VS Code Server in `~/.vscode-server/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long can the VS Code Server installation take?",
    "answer": "The installation can take up to 5 minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do after the VS Code Server installation is complete?",
    "answer": "Once done, close the connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What might a user be prompted for multiple times during the first VS Code connection?",
    "answer": "Users will be prompted many times for their SSH key passphrase."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if the SSH public key passphrase prompt does not appear?",
    "answer": "Make sure to copy your SSH public key as described in point 3 under 'Configuration of your SSH keys'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you handle a VS Code connection if multifactor authentication (MFA) is enabled?",
    "answer": "If MFA is enabled, you will need to check the 'details' of the connection to see the prompt for the 2nd factor in the VS Code Terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended method to cleanly close a VS Code remote connection?",
    "answer": "To cleanly close a connection, click on the bottom-left corner of VS Code and select 'Close Remote Connection' at the top of the window."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to cleanly close a VS Code remote connection?",
    "answer": "A clean closure prevents orphan processes from accumulating on the login node and avoids issues or confusion if the next connection is to a different login node."
