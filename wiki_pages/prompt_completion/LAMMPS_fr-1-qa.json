    "answer": "You can execute `module avail lammps` to see installed versions and choose the one you wish to use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there different LAMMPS modules for the same version?",
    "answer": "Yes, there can be multiple modules for a single version. For example, the March 31, 2017, version had `lammps/20170331` (MPI), `lammps-omp/20170331` (USER-OMP), and `lammps-user-intel/20170331` (USER-INTEL)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What module needs to be loaded before LAMMPS if I want to use GPU acceleration?",
    "answer": "The CUDA module must be loaded before the LAMMPS module for GPU functionality."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the symbolic link for LAMMPS executables on the clusters?",
    "answer": "All LAMMPS versions installed on the clusters have the symbolic link `lmp`, allowing you to execute LAMMPS by calling `lmp` regardless of the specific module used."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I find the original name of a LAMMPS executable for a particular module?",
    "answer": "After loading a LAMMPS module, you can list the files in the `${EBROOTLAMMPS}/bin` directory using `ls ${EBROOTLAMMPS}/bin/` to find the original executable name."
  },
  {
    "question": "Approximately how many different packages do recent LAMMPS versions include?",
    "answer": "Recent LAMMPS versions include approximately 60 different packages."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can all LAMMPS packages be activated in a single executable?",
    "answer": "No, not all packages can be activated in the same executable."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find documentation regarding LAMMPS packages?",
    "answer": "You can consult the documentation on packages at https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Packages.html."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check which packages are enabled for a loaded LAMMPS module if a `list-packages.txt` file is provided?",
    "answer": "If `list-packages.txt` is provided, you can load the module and then use `cat ${EBROOTLAMMPS}/list-packages.txt` to see the supported and unsupported packages."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if the `list-packages.txt` file is not found but I need to know which packages are available for a LAMMPS module?",
    "answer": "If `list-packages.txt` is not found, you might be able to determine available packages by opening the EasyBuild recipe file at `${EBROOTLAMMPS}/easybuild/LAMMPS*.eb` and looking in the `general_packages` block."
