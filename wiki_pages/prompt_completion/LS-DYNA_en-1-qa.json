  {
    "question": "What commands are used to check if an LS-DYNA license file is working?",
    "answer": "To check if your license file is working, run 'module load ls-dyna' followed by 'ls-dyna_s' or 'ls-dyna_d'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What output indicates a working LS-DYNA license (with the exception of CMC license servers)?",
    "answer": "The output header should contain a non-empty value for 'Licensed to:' if the license is working, with the exception of CMC license servers."

  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two options for specifying an LSTC license server?",
    "answer": "The two options are to specify the license server by creating a file named `ls-dyna.lic` or by setting two environment variables in your slurm scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify an LSTC license server using the `ls-dyna.lic` file method?",
    "answer": "Create a file named `ls-dyna.lic` with `#LICENSE_TYPE: network` and `#LICENSE_SERVER:<port>@<server>` as its contents, and place this file in the `$HOME/.licenses/` directory on each cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should the `ls-dyna.lic` file be placed for an LSTC license?",
    "answer": "The `ls-dyna.lic` file should be placed in the `$HOME/.licenses/` directory on each cluster where you plan to submit jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is using the `ls-dyna.lic` file recommended for LSTC license servers?",
    "answer": "This approach is recommended because the module system sets the LSTC_FILE variable, causing identical settings to automatically be used by all jobs submitted on the cluster without needing to specify them in each slurm script or environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which environment variables should be set to specify an LSTC license server in slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "You should set `export LSTC_LICENSE=network` and `export LSTC_LICENSE_SERVER=<port>@<server>` in your slurm scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do environment variables for LSTC licenses take priority over the `ls-dyna.lic` file?",
    "answer": "Yes, environment variables like `LSTC_LICENSE` and `LSTC_LICENSE_SERVER` will take priority over any values specified in your `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is necessary for LS-DYNA modules to load successfully when using environment variables for LSTC licenses?",
    "answer": "The `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file must exist (even if empty) for any `ls-dyna` or `ls-dyna-mpi` module to successfully load."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to ensure the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file exists?",
    "answer": "To ensure the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file exists, run `touch ~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` once on the command line on each cluster."
