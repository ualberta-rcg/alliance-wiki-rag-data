    "question": "How can you determine which version of Ansys Fluent was used to create a .cas file?",
    "answer": "You can use `grep -ia fluent` on the .cas file, for example: `grep -ia fluent combustor.cas` for legacy files or `grep -ia fluent cavity.cas.h5` for H5 files."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can detailed platform support information for Ansys software and hardware compatibility be found?",
    "answer": "Detailed platform support information for current and previous Ansys releases is available on the Ansys website. The 'Platform Support by Application / Product' PDF is particularly useful."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Ansys package is supported under Windows but not Linux, and therefore not on the Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "Spaceclaim is supported under Windows but not under Linux, and thus not available on Alliance systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does Ansys post information about product releases and updates?",
    "answer": "Ansys posts product release and update information on their website, their blog page (using the FILTERS search bar), and via the Press Release search bar by specifying a version number."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to use the recently installed `ansys/2025R1.02` module?",
    "answer": "Using the `ansys/2025R1.02` module requires a suitably updated license server, such as CMCs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the current version compatibility for the SHARCNET license server regarding Ansys modules?",
    "answer": "Until the SHARCNET license server upgrade is complete, it will only support jobs run with `ansys/2024R2.04` or older versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are Ansys service packs reflected in module naming conventions starting with Ansys 2024?",
    "answer": "Starting with Ansys 2024, a separate Ansys module will appear on the clusters with a decimal and two digits after the release number for installed service packs (e.g., `ansys/2024R1.03` for Service Pack 3)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users load the latest Ansys module version, including the most recent service pack?",
    "answer": "Most users can load the latest module version equipped with the latest installed service pack by simply doing `module load ansys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are separate modules provided for each Ansys service pack?",
    "answer": "Separate modules for each service pack are provided because, while service packs are not expected to impact numerical results, the changes they make are extensive, allowing groups to continue using earlier versions if computations have already been done."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can a detailed description of Ansys service pack changes be found for Ansys 2024R1 and future versions?",
    "answer": "For Ansys 2024R1, detailed service pack descriptions can be found by searching the link `https://storage.ansys.com/staticfiles/cp/Readme/release2024R1/info_combined.pdf` for 'Service Pack Details'. Future versions will presumably be similarly searchable by modifying the version number in the link."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main challenge with Ansys MPI implementations and the Slurm scheduler?",
    "answer": "None of the Ansys software suite's MPI implementations directly support the Slurm scheduler, necessitating special instructions for each Ansys package to start parallel jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step in running an Ansys Fluent job on a cluster?",
    "answer": "The first step is to prepare your Fluent job using Fluent from Ansys Workbench on your desktop machine up to the point where you would run the calculation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you export a Fluent case file?",
    "answer": "You export the case file from Fluent using `File > Export > Case\u2026` or by finding it in your project's folder, where it often has a name like `FFF-1.cas.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of a Fluent journal file?",
    "answer": "A journal file's purpose is to load the case file (and optionally data file), run the solver, and finally write the results."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should you consider modifying your Slurm script to requeue a Fluent job?",
    "answer": "You should consider modifying your script to requeue your job if jobs frequently fail to start due to license shortages and manual resubmission is not convenient."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a potential drawback of using job requeuing for Fluent simulations?",
    "answer": "Requeuing can also restart simulations that fail due to non-license related issues, such as divergence, leading to lost compute time. It is strongly recommended to monitor Slurm output to confirm requeue attempts are license related."
