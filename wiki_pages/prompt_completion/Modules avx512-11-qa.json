    "question": "What is BigDFT and what are its main features?",
    "answer": "BigDFT is a massively parallel electronic structure code based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). It utilizes a wavelet basis set with linear scaling capabilities, an adaptive mesh with two levels of resolution, and GTH or HGH pseudopotentials for core electron removal. It can simulate periodic systems, surfaces, and isolated systems with explicit boundary conditions using its Poisson solver."
