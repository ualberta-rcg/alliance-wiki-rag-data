    "question": "What is the recommended use for SCRATCH storage?",
    "answer": "SCRATCH is the best choice for intensive read/write operations on large files (> 100 MB per file) and should be used for temporary files like checkpoint files, output from jobs, and other data that can easily be recreated."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are files stored on SCRATCH backed up?",
    "answer": "No, important files must be copied off SCRATCH since they are not backed up there."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to older files on SCRATCH?",
    "answer": "Older files on SCRATCH are subject to purging."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of data should NOT be stored on SCRATCH?",
    "answer": "SCRATCH should not be regarded as normal storage; it is for transient files that you can afford to lose."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is NEARLINE storage intended for?",
    "answer": "NEARLINE is a tape-based filesystem intended for inactive data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of datasets are good candidates for NEARLINE storage?",
    "answer": "Datasets which you do not expect to access for months are good candidates to be stored in /nearline."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `$SLURM_TMPDIR` environment variable?",
    "answer": "While a job is running, `$SLURM_TMPDIR` holds a unique path to a temporary folder on a fast, local filesystem on each compute node allocated to the job, to be used for temporary files needed only for the duration of the job."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are the contents of `$SLURM_TMPDIR` deleted?",
    "answer": "When the job ends, the directory and its contents are deleted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the advantage of using `$SLURM_TMPDIR` compared to other networked filesystems?",
    "answer": "Its advantage is increased performance due to the filesystem being local to the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of files is `$SLURM_TMPDIR` especially well-suited for?",
    "answer": "It is especially well-suited for large collections of small files (for example, smaller than a few megabytes per file)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is `$SLURM_TMPDIR` shared or exclusive to a single job?",
    "answer": "This filesystem is shared between all jobs running on the node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user obtain an estimate of their space and file count use on the entire project space?",
    "answer": "Users can obtain an estimate of their space and file count use on the entire project space by running the command `lfs quota -u $USER /project`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user estimate the number of files in a specific directory (and its subdirectories)?",
    "answer": "Users can obtain an estimate for the number of files in a given directory (and its subdirectories) using the command `lfs find <path to the directory> -type f | wc -l`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a general best practice for data management in scratch and project spaces?",
    "answer": "Regularly clean up your data in the scratch and project spaces, because those filesystems are used for huge data collections."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended process for safely deleting a set of files?",
    "answer": "To safely delete files, create a temporary directory `toDelete`, move the files to be deleted into it, verify its contents, and then delete `toDelete` recursively."
  },
  {
    "question": "What caution should be exercised when using `rm` commands in shell scripts?",
    "answer": "In shell scripts, if environment variables are used in `rm` commands, each variable has to be tested before use, as empty or undefined variables can cause catastrophic errors, and any input value has to be checked against malicious or erroneous use of the script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommendation for using text format for files?",
    "answer": "Only use text format for files that are smaller than a few megabytes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should temporary files be stored?",
    "answer": "As far as possible, use scratch and local storage for temporary files; for local storage, the temporary directory created by the job scheduler, named `$SLURM_TMPDIR`, can be used."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can programs optimize searching within a file?",
    "answer": "If your program must search within a file, it is fastest to do it by first reading it completely before searching."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done with files that are no longer actively used but must be retained?",
    "answer": "If you no longer use certain files but they must be retained, archive and compress them, and if possible move them to an alternative location like nearline."
  },
  {
    "question": "What potential issues can arise from parallel write access to a file on a shared filesystem?",
    "answer": "Having any sort of parallel write access to a file stored on a shared filesystem like home, scratch, and project is likely to create problems unless you are using a specialized tool such as MPI-IO."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should users contact technical support regarding storage options?",
    "answer": "If your needs are not well served by the available storage options, you should contact technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What default storage spaces do users and groups have access to on the clusters?",
    "answer": "By default on our clusters, each user has access to the home and scratch spaces, and each group has access to 1 TB of project space."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users obtain small or larger increases in project and scratch spaces?",
    "answer": "Small increases in project and scratch spaces are available through the Rapid Access Service, while larger increases in project spaces are available through the annual Resource Allocation Competition."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to check current quota usage for various filesystems?",
    "answer": "You can see your current quota usage for various filesystems on our clusters using the command `diskusage_report`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default quota for Home Space on the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "The default quota for Home Space on the Fir cluster is 50 GB and 500,000 files per user."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Home Space backed up on the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "Yes, Home Space is backed up on the Fir cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default quota for Scratch Space on the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "The default quota for Scratch Space on the Fir cluster is 20 TB and 1 million files per user."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purging policy for Scratch Space on the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "On the Fir cluster, files older than 60 days are purged from Scratch Space."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default quota for Project Space on the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "The default quota for Project Space on the Fir cluster is 1 TB and 500,000 files per group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Project Space be increased on the Fir cluster, and if so, to what maximum?",
    "answer": "Yes, Project space on the Fir cluster can be increased up to 40 TB per group by a RAS request, or through the annual Resource Allocation Competition."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default quota for Nearline Space on the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "The default quota for Nearline Space on the Fir cluster is 2 TB and 5,000 files per group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Nearline Space mounted on compute nodes on the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "No, Nearline Space is not mounted on compute nodes on the Fir cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the general backup policy for home and project spaces?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user recover a previous version of a file or directory?",
    "answer": "To recover a previous version of a file or directory, you should contact technical support with the full path for the file(s) and desired version (by date)."
