    "question": "What is the recommended use for SCRATCH storage?",
    "answer": "SCRATCH storage is best for intensive read/write operations on large files (over 100 MB), temporary files, checkpoint files, output from jobs, and other data that can be easily recreated. It should not be regarded as normal storage for important files."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are files stored on SCRATCH backed up?",
    "answer": "No, important files must be copied off SCRATCH because they are not backed up there."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to older files on SCRATCH?",
    "answer": "Older files on SCRATCH are subject to purging."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of NEARLINE storage?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Where should inactive datasets be stored?",
    "answer": "Inactive datasets that you do not expect to access for months should be stored in `/nearline`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is `$SLURM_TMPDIR`?",
    "answer": "`$SLURM_TMPDIR` is an environment variable that holds a unique path to a temporary folder on a fast, local filesystem on each compute node allocated to a job."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are the contents of `$SLURM_TMPDIR` deleted?",
    "answer": "The directory and its contents in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` are deleted when the job ends."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the advantage of using `$SLURM_TMPDIR`?",
    "answer": "The advantage of using `$SLURM_TMPDIR` is increased performance due to the filesystem being local to the compute node, making it well-suited for temporary files or large collections of small files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users check their individual space and file count usage on the entire project space?",
    "answer": "Users can obtain an estimate of their space and file count use on the entire project space by running the command `lfs quota -u $USER /project`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users estimate the number of files in a specific directory within project space?",
    "answer": "Users can obtain an estimate for the number of files in a given directory (and its subdirectories) using the command `lfs find <path to the directory> -type f | wc -l`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key best practice for managing data in scratch and project spaces?",
    "answer": "Regularly clean up your data in the scratch and project spaces, as these filesystems are used for huge data collections."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended method for safely deleting files?",
    "answer": "To safely delete files, create a temporary directory `toDelete`, move the files to be deleted into it, verify its contents, and then delete `toDelete` recursively."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be avoided when using `rm` commands?",
    "answer": "If possible, avoid using `*` and `/` characters in your `rm` commands, and always navigate to the parent directory and double-check you are in the correct directory before deleting."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the best practice for storing text files?",
    "answer": "Only use text format for files that are smaller than a few megabytes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should temporary files be stored for optimal performance?",
    "answer": "As far as possible, use scratch and local storage for temporary files, utilizing the temporary directory created by the job scheduler, named `$SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the fastest way for a program to search within a file?",
    "answer": "If a program must search within a file, it is fastest to do it by first reading it completely before searching."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done with files that are no longer used but must be retained?",
    "answer": "If you no longer use certain files but they must be retained, archive and compress them, and if possible, move them to an alternative location like Nearline."
  },
  {
    "question": "What issues can parallel write access to shared filesystems cause?",
    "answer": "Having any sort of parallel write access to a file stored on a shared filesystem like home, scratch, and project is likely to create problems unless a specialized tool such as MPI-IO is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users get assistance if available storage options don't meet their needs?",
    "answer": "If your needs are not well served by the available storage options, you should contact technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default storage allocations for users and groups on clusters?",
    "answer": "By default, each user has access to home and scratch spaces, and each group has access to 1 TB of project space."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users increase their project and scratch space allocations?",
    "answer": "Small increases in project and scratch spaces are available through the Rapid Access Service (RAS), while larger increases in project spaces are available through the annual Resource Allocation Competition (RAC)."
