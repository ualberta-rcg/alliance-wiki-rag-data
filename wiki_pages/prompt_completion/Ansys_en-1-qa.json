    "answer": "Users should contact technical support if the Ansys module does not find its license automatically."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does the Ansys module look for license information in a user's environment?",
    "answer": "The Ansys module looks for license information in a few places, including the user's /home folder, specifically in a file named `$HOME/.licenses/ansys.lic`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify your license server in the `ansys.lic` file?",
    "answer": "You specify your license server by creating a file named `$HOME/.licenses/ansys.lic` with two lines: `setenv(\"ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE\", \"FLEXPORT@LICSERVER\")` and `setenv(\"ANSYSLI_SERVERS\", \"INTEPORT@LICSERVER\")`, replacing FLEXPORT, INTEPORT, and LICSERVER with appropriate values."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the LICSERVER and FLEXPORT values for a CMC license on the 'fir' cluster?",
    "answer": "For a CMC license on the 'fir' cluster, the LICSERVER is `172.26.0.101` and the FLEXPORT is `6624`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the INTEPORT values for CMC licenses across different clusters?",
    "answer": "The INTEPORT value for CMC licenses on 'fir', 'nibi', 'narval/rorqual', and 'trillium' clusters is `2325`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the LICSERVER and FLEXPORT values for a SHARCNET license on 'narval/rorqual'?",
    "answer": "For a SHARCNET license on 'narval/rorqual', the LICSERVER is `license3.sharcnet.ca` and the FLEXPORT is `1055`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which SHARCNET license server supports Ansys versions up to `ansys/2025R1.02`?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET license server `license1.computecanada.ca` (used for 'nibi' cluster) supports Ansys versions up to `ansys/2025R1.02`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What special SSH commands are required for Ansys jobs running on 'trillium' to use the SHARCNET license server?",
    "answer": "Ansys jobs on 'trillium' using the SHARCNET license server require setting: `ssh tri-gw -fNL 1055:license1.computecanada.ca:1055` and `ssh tri-gw -fNL 1793:license1.computecanada.ca:1793`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What must researchers do after purchasing a new CMC license subscription to ensure license checkouts succeed?",
    "answer": "Researchers who purchase a new CMC license subscription must submit their Alliance account username to CMC support; otherwise, license checkouts will fail."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find information about the number of cores usable with a CMC license?",
    "answer": "The number of cores that can be used with a CMC license is described in the 'Other Tricks and Tips' sections of the Ansys Electronics Desktop and Ansys Mechanical/Fluids quick start guides on cmc.ca."
  },
  {
    "question": "What initial changes are necessary before a local institutional Ansys license server can be used on the Alliance?",
    "answer": "Before a local institutional Ansys license server can be used, firewall changes will need to be made on both the server and cluster side."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is needed from a local Ansys license server administrator for a 'ready to use' server?",
    "answer": "For a 'ready to use' server, you need the fully qualified hostname (LICSERVER), the Ansys flex port (FLEXPORT, commonly 1055), and the Ansys licensing interconnect port (INTEPORT, commonly 2325) from your administrator."
  },
  {
    "question": "What additional information is required for an Ansys license server that has 'never been set up' on the Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "In addition to the hostname and port numbers, you will also need the static vendor port (VENDPORT) number and confirmation that the `<servername>` (found in the first line of the license file) resolves to the same IP as LICSERVER on Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the process for setting up a new local Ansys license server for use on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "You need to obtain the LICSERVER hostname, FLEXPORT, INTEPORT, and VENDPORT, then send this information to technical support, specifying the desired Alliance clusters. Alliance system administrators will open the firewall, and then provide IP addresses for your server administrator to open the local firewall on FLEXPORT, INTEPORT, and VENDPORT."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user test if their `ansys.lic` file is correctly configured?",
    "answer": "To test the `ansys.lic` configuration, a user can copy/paste a sequence of commands including `salloc`, `module load ansys/VERSION`, and `$EBROOTANSYS/.../lmutil lmstat -c $ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE` on the cluster, replacing `YOURUSERID` and specifying the correct Ansys module version."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a 'Success' output indicate when checking the Ansys license?",
    "answer": "A 'Success' output indicates that license checkouts should work when jobs are submitted to the queue."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the general compatibility rule for Ansys simulations regarding different versions?",
    "answer": "Ansys simulations are typically forward compatible but NOT backwards compatible, meaning older simulations work on newer Ansys versions, but newer simulations will likely fail or crash on older versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user determine the Ansys Fluent version used to create a `.cas` or `.cas.h5` file?",
    "answer": "A user can grep the `.cas` or `.cas.h5` file for 'fluent' (e.g., `grep -ia fluent combustor.cas` or `grep -ia fluent cavity.cas.h5`) to find clues about the Fluent version used."
