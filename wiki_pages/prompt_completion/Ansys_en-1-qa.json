    "question": "What additional information is needed if a local Ansys license server has never been set up for use on the Alliance clusters?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important for the `<servername>` to resolve to the same IP as LICSERVER on Alliance clusters?",

  {
    "question": "What is the process after collecting all necessary information for a new local license server setup?",
    "answer": "You must send the LICSERVER, FLEXPORT, INTEPORT, and VENDPORT values by email to technical support, mentioning which Alliance cluster(s) you want to run Ansys jobs on, so they can open the firewall."
