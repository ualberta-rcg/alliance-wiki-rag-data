  {
    "question": "What initial steps are needed to use a local institutional Ansys license server on the Alliance?",
    "answer": "Firewall changes will need to be done on both the server and cluster sides."
  },
  {
    "question": "For a local Ansys license server that is 'Ready to use', what information is needed from the administrator?",
    "answer": "You need the fully qualified hostname (LICSERVER), the Ansys flex port (FLEXPORT, commonly 1055), and the Ansys licensing interconnect port (INTEPORT, commonly 2325)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure the `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file for an already set up local license server?",

  {
    "question": "What additional information is required for a new local Ansys license server setup?",
    "answer": "In addition to the hostname and ports, you'll need the static vendor port (VENDPORT) number and confirmation that the `<servername>` in your license file resolves to the same IP as LICSERVER on Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it crucial for `<servername>` to resolve to the same IP as LICSERVER for new license server setups?",
    "answer": "It is required because otherwise, Ansys license checkouts will not work on any remote cluster at the Alliance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information should be emailed to technical support for a new local Ansys license server setup?",
    "answer": "You should email the LICSERVER, FLEXPORT, INTEPORT, and VENDPORT values, and specify which Alliance cluster(s) you want to run Ansys jobs on."
