    "question": "What is the security risk associated with using `chmod -R 777` on a home folder?",
    "answer": "Using `chmod -R 777` on a home folder or any folder is a huge security risk and is completely unacceptable on shared facilities like clusters, in addition to being unnecessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for sharing data with a colleague who is part of the same research group?",
    "answer": "The best approach is to make use of the project space that each research group has in common."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a research group request the creation of a group on one of the national clusters?",
    "answer": "They can request it by contacting technical support, as users cannot create their own groups."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can data be shared with someone who does not have an account on the cluster?",
    "answer": "You can use Globus, and specifically a shared endpoint, to share the data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the simplest way to share data with a colleague who has an account on the cluster but is not in your common research group?",
    "answer": "The simplest approach is to use the permissions available in the filesystem to share the data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required for an individual to access a shared file located within a directory chain?",
    "answer": "The individual must have execute permission for each directory between the root (e.g., `/scratch` or `/project`) and the directory containing the file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of permissions do the filesystems on the clusters support?",
    "answer": "They support the idea of permissions to read, write, and execute files and directories."
  },
  {
    "question": "What error message will appear if you attempt to access a file or directory without the necessary permissions?",
    "answer": "You will see the error message \"Permission denied\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three categories of users associated with each filesystem object for permissions?",
    "answer": "The three categories of users are the object's owner, members of the object's group, and everyone else."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view the current permissions for a filesystem object?",
    "answer": "You can view the current permissions using the command `ls -l name_of_object`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the permission string `-rw-r--r--` signify for a file?",
    "answer": "It means the owner can read and write the file but not execute it, while members of the group and everyone else can only read the file."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory?",
    "answer": "The `chmod` command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What abbreviations are used for user categories when using the `chmod` command in symbolic mode?",
    "answer": "The abbreviations used are `u` for the owner (user), `g` for the group, `o` for others (everyone else on the cluster), and `a` for everyone (all)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How would you grant read permission to all members of the group that `file.txt` belongs to?",
    "answer": "You would use a command like `chmod g+r file.txt`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you remove execute permission for 'everyone but the owner and the group' for a file named `script.py`?",
    "answer": "You would use the command `chmod o-x script.py`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you grant everyone on the cluster the right to read `file.txt` using `chmod`?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `chmod a+r file.txt`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is octal notation calculated for Unix filesystem permissions?",
    "answer": "Octal notation uses three bits to represent permissions for each user category, interpreted as a number from 0 to 7 using the formula (read_bit)*4 + (write_bit)*2 + (execute_bit)*1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the octal representation for a file where the owner can read and write, and the group and everyone else can only read?",
    "answer": "The octal representation for these permissions would be 644."
