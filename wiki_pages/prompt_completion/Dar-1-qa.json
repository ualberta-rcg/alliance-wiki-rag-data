  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-O` flag when extracting with `dar`?",
    "answer": "The `-O` flag tells `dar` to ignore file ownership, which is useful if you are not root or are restoring someone else's files, and it disables a confirmation warning for non-root users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `-w` flag do during `dar` extraction?",
