    "answer": "Nibi and Fir have 192 CPUs per node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are users asked not to use entire nodes for Gaussian tasks on Nibi and Fir?",
    "answer": "Users are asked not to use entire nodes on Nibi and Fir because it would not be efficient for Gaussian tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should users do if their Gaussian tasks require more memory than a single node can provide?",
    "answer": "If tasks require more memory than a single node can provide, users should note that each cluster offers some nodes with more memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What files are required to submit a Gaussian task?",
    "answer": "In addition to the input file (e.g., `name.com`), you must prepare a script describing the computational resources for the task; this script must be in the same directory as the input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many options are there for Gaussian tasks, and what do they depend on?",
    "answer": "There are two options for Gaussian tasks, depending on the location of default execution files and the size of the task."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are the default execution files stored for Gaussian tasks using Option 1 (G16, G09, G03)?",
    "answer": "With Option 1, the default execution files (unnamed .rwf, .inp, .d2e, .int, .skr) are saved in `/scratch/username/jobid/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the default execution files in Option 1 if a Gaussian task is not completed or fails?",
    "answer": "In Option 1, the default execution files remain in `/scratch/username/jobid/` if the task is not completed or has failed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the .rwf file be recovered for restarting a task later when using Option 1?",
    "answer": "Yes, the .rwf file can be recovered from `/scratch/username/jobid/` to restart the task later with Option 1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended for file naming consistency in Gaussian tasks?",
    "answer": "For consistency, it is recommended that files for Gaussian tasks (e.g., `.sh`, `.com`, `.log`) have the same name with different extensions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What SLURM directive is used to specify the account for a Gaussian job script?",
    "answer": "The `SBATCH --account` directive is used, for example, `#SBATCH --account=def-someuser`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is memory specified in a Gaussian job script, and what is the general recommendation?",
    "answer": "Memory is specified using `SBATCH --mem`, and it is recommended to be roughly 2 times the `%mem` defined in the input `.com` file, e.g., `#SBATCH --mem=32G`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify the expected run time for a Gaussian job in a SLURM script?",
    "answer": "The expected run time is specified using `SBATCH --time` in DD-HH:MM format, e.g., `#SBATCH --time=02-00:00`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What SLURM directive specifies the number of CPUs per task for a Gaussian job?",
    "answer": "The `SBATCH --cpus-per-task` directive specifies the number of CPUs for the job, as defined by `%nprocs` in the `.com` file, e.g., `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command loads the Gaussian G16.c01 module in a job script?",
    "answer": "The command `module load gaussian/g16.c01` loads the Gaussian G16.c01 module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to execute a Gaussian G16 task using Option 1?",
    "answer": "The command `G16 name.com` executes a G16 task, where `name.com` is the input and `name.log` is the output."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you use Gaussian 09 or Gaussian 03 instead of G16 with Option 1?",
    "answer": "To use Gaussian 09 or Gaussian 03, replace `gaussian/g16.c01` with `gaussian/g09.e01` or `gaussian/g03.d01` in the `module load` command, and replace `G16` with `G09` or `G03` for the execution command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which SLURM script parameters should be adjusted based on the computational resource needs for a Gaussian task?",
    "answer": "The `--mem`, `--time`, and `--cpus-per-task` parameters in the SLURM script should be adjusted according to computational resource needs."
