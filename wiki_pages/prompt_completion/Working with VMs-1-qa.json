    "answer": "To lock a VM, click on the 'Lock Instance' option from the Actions drop-down menu on the dashboard."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when a VM is locked?",
    "answer": "Once a VM is locked, most of the Actions menu items will not be able to be executed until the instance is unlocked."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there an indicator for a VM's lock state?",

  {
    "question": "How can a VM be resized?",
    "answer": "It is possible to resize a VM by changing its flavor."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors influence VM resizing considerations?",
    "answer": "The considerations for resizing a VM depend on whether you have a 'p' flavor or a 'c' flavor VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there risks associated with resizing a VM?",
    "answer": "Yes, resizing a VM may involve some risk as it is similar to deleting and recreating your VM with a new flavor."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted if there are doubts about resizing a VM?",
    "answer": "If in doubt about resizing a VM, contact cloud technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a common characteristic of 'c' flavor VMs?",
    "answer": "'c' flavors often have extra ephemeral drives."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do ephemeral drives behave when a 'c' flavor VM is resized?",
    "answer": "The ephemeral drives will be resized when you choose a new 'c' flavor."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can 'c' flavor ephemeral drives become smaller during a resize?",
    "answer": "No, 'c' flavor ephemeral drives cannot become smaller."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the resizing limitations for 'c' flavor VMs?",
    "answer": "'c' flavor VMs can only be resized to flavors with equal or larger ephemeral drives."
  },
  {
    "question": "After resizing a 'c' flavor VM, will the larger ephemeral drive space be immediately visible?",
    "answer": "No, after resizing, you will not immediately see a larger ephemeral drive within your VM, and commands like 'df -h' will not show the size increase."
  },
  {
    "question": "What must be done to see the extra space after resizing a 'c' flavor VM?",
    "answer": "To see the extra space after resizing a 'c' flavor VM, you will need to resize your filesystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to resize a filesystem?",
    "answer": "The 'resize2fs' command is used to resize the filesystem."
  },
  {

    "answer": "Before resizing a filesystem, it is recommended to create backups of its contents."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do 'p' flavor VMs typically have extra ephemeral drives?",
    "answer": "No, unlike 'c' flavors, 'p' flavors do not typically have extra ephemeral drives associated with them."
  },
  {
    "question": "To what sizes can 'p' flavor VMs be resized?",
    "answer": "'p' flavor VMs can be resized to larger and smaller flavors."
