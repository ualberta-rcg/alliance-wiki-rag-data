    "answer": "To use the SHARCNET Ansys license, configure your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file with the following lines: `setenv(\"ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE\", \"1055@license3.sharcnet.ca\")` and `setenv(\"ANSYSLI_SERVERS\", \"2325@license3.sharcnet.ca\")`."

    "question": "How can I check the number of Ansys licenses in use by my username and by all users?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I find Ansys licenses unexpectedly in use under my username?",
    "answer": "If you find licenses unexpectedly in use, connect to the node where it's running (e.g., `gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca` or `gra-vdi4.sharcnet.ca`), open a terminal window, and run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys\"` to terminate the rogue processes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might Ansys licenses be unexpectedly tied up by my username?",
    "answer": "Licenses can be unexpectedly tied up if Ansys does not exit cleanly on gra-vdi, or due to other unusual errors."

  {
    "question": "What choice do researchers have regarding loading Ansys modules when using gra-vdi?",

  },
  {
    "question": "When are settings from `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` used for local Ansys modules on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Settings from `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` are only used when `dash gui` is appended to the Ansys program name, for example, `fluent-gui` instead of `fluent`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the suitable usage for Ansys on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Suitable usage includes running a single job interactively (GUI or command line) with up to 8 cores and 128G RAM, creating or modifying simulation input files, and post-processing or visualizing data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I load a local Ansys module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "First, connect to `gra-vdi.computecanada.ca` with TigerVNC. Then, open a new terminal window and load a module like `module load SnEnv ansys/2024R2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "After loading a local module on gra-vdi, how do I start an Ansys program?",
    "answer": "You can directly start one of the Ansys programs from the command line, such as `runwb2[-gui]`, `fluent[-gui]`, `cfx5[-gui]`, `icemcfd[-gui]`, `apdl[-gui]`, or `Rocky[-gui]`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What options become available if I run `cfx5-gui` from a local Ansys module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "If you run `cfx5-gui`, your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file will first be read, and then you'll get the option to select the CMC server and choose which CFX program (CFX-Launcher, CFX-Pre, CFD-Post, or CFX-Solver) will be started in GUI mode."
