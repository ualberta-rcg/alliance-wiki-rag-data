    "question": "How do I configure my `ansys.lic` file to use the SHARCNET Ansys license on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "To use the SHARCNET Ansys license, create or edit `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` with the following lines: `setenv(\"ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE\", \"1055@license3.sharcnet.ca\")` and `setenv(\"ANSYSLI_SERVERS\", \"2325@license3.sharcnet.ca\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can I use to check the Ansys licenses currently in use by my username on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "Log in to a cluster like Graham (`ssh graham.computecanada.ca`), load the Ansys module (`module load ansys`), and then run `lmutil lmstat -c $ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE -a | grep \"Users of\\\\|$USER\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I terminate rogue Ansys processes that are unexpectedly holding licenses on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "First, ensure you are connected to the specific gra-vdi node (e.g., `gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca` or `gra-vdi4.sharcnet.ca`) using TigerVNC. Then, open a terminal and run the command `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys\"` to terminate rogue processes and free up licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the advantages of loading local Ansys modules on gra-vdi compared to global environment modules?",
    "answer": "Local Ansys modules on gra-vdi (loaded after `SnEnv`) may offer access to some Ansys programs and versions not yet supported by the standard global environment modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "When using local Ansys modules on gra-vdi, how are the settings from `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` applied?",
    "answer": "Settings from `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` are only used when a `dash gui` suffix is appended to the Ansys program name, for example, `fluent-gui` instead of `fluent`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended usage guidelines for running Ansys programs interactively on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "On gra-vdi, Ansys programs are suitable for running a single interactive job (GUI or command line) with up to 8 cores and 128GB RAM, creating/modifying simulation input files, post-processing, or visualizing data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I load a local Ansys module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Connect to `gra-vdi.computecanada.ca` with TigerVNC, open a new terminal, and load a module using `module load SnEnv ansys/2024R2` (or an older version)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Ansys programs can be started from the command line after loading a local Ansys module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "You can directly start `runwb2[-gui]`, `fluent[-gui]`, `cfx5[-gui]`, `icemcfd[-gui]`, `apdl[-gui]`, or `Rocky[-gui]`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What options are presented when running `cfx5-gui` from a local Ansys module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Running `cfx5-gui` first reads your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file, then gives you the option to select the CMC server, and finally allows you to choose which CFX program to start in GUI mode: CFX-Launcher, CFX-Pre, CFD-Post, or CFX-Solver."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I encounter a license problem with Ansys and the `anslic_admin` preferences are no longer supported?",
    "answer": "If a license problem occurs, try removing the `~/.ansys` directory in your `/home` account to clear settings. If problems persist, contact technical support and provide the contents of your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file."
