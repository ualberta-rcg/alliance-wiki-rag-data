  {
    "question": "What is computational chemistry?",
    "answer": "Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that incorporates the results of theoretical chemistry into computer programs to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the methods in computational chemistry programs generally categorized?",
    "answer": "Most computer programs in the field offer methods grouped in terms of the trade-off between accuracy, applicability, and cost."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are 'ab initio' methods based on?",
    "answer": "'ab initio' methods are based entirely on first principles."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main characteristics of 'ab initio' methods?",
    "answer": "'ab initio' methods tend to be broadly applicable but very costly in terms of CPU time, making them mostly suitable for systems with a small number of particles."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do semi-empirical methods compare in speed to 'ab initio' methods?",
    "answer": "Semi-empirical methods are typically much faster than 'ab initio' methods, though they give accurate results for a narrower range of cases."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the cost-accuracy trade-off for density functional methods?",
    "answer": "Density functional methods may be thought of as a compromise in cost between 'ab initio' and semi-empirical methods, offering a very good cost-accuracy trade-off."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are molecular mechanics methods based on?",
    "answer": "Molecular mechanics methods are based on classical mechanics instead of quantum mechanics."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do molecular mechanics methods reproduce material properties?",
    "answer": "They use a force field that can be optimized using 'ab initio' and/or experimental data to reproduce the properties of the materials."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are molecular mechanics methods frequently used for molecular dynamics calculations?",
    "answer": "Because of their low cost, molecular mechanics methods are frequently used for molecular dynamics calculations and can be applied to systems of thousands or even millions of particles."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are molecular dynamics calculations particularly useful for?",
    "answer": "Molecular dynamics calculations are extremely useful in the study of biological systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of materials can molecular dynamics calculations simulate?",
    "answer": "They can be used to simulate glasses, metals, liquids, supercooled liquids, granular materials, and complex materials."
  },
  {
    "question": "Name three computational chemistry applications listed.",
    "answer": "Some listed applications include ABINIT, ADF/AMS, AMBER, CP2K, CPMD, Dalton, deMon, DL_POLY, GAMESS-US, Gaussian, GPAW, GROMACS, HOOMD-blue, LAMMPS, MRCC, NAMD, NBO, NWChem, OpenKIM, OpenMM, ORCA, PLUMED, PSI4, Quantum ESPRESSO, Rosetta, SIESTA, VASP, and XTB."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which application includes NBO modules?",
    "answer": "NBO is included in several Gaussian modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Molden used for?",
    "answer": "Molden is a visualization tool for use in conjunction with GAMESS, Gaussian, and other applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is VMD?",
    "answer": "VMD is an open-source molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems in 3D."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Libxc?",
    "answer": "Libxc is a library used in density-functional models."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of Open Babel?",
    "answer": "Open Babel is a set of tools designed to enable one to search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling, chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas."
