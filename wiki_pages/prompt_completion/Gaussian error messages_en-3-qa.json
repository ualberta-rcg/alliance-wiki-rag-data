    "question": "What does 'Convergence failure -- run terminated' in Gaussian output signify?",
    "answer": "It means the SCF (self-consistent field) procedure has failed to converge."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I fix an SCF convergence failure in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You can try using a better guess (e.g., `guess=read` from a lower-level SCF), an alternate SCF converger like `SCF=QC` or `SCF=XQC`, fixing a poor initial geometry, or resubmitting the job with an earlier geometry and a newly evaluated Hessian."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'FOPT requested but NVar= XX while NDOF= YY' error indicate in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error indicates that a full optimization (FOpt) was requested, but a check of the variables revealed an incorrect number."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should I fix the 'FOPT requested but NVar= XX while NDOF= YY' error if NDOF is less than NVar?",
    "answer": "If NDOF is less than NVar, the molecule is likely being run in lower symmetry than it possesses, and you should consider running it with higher symmetry."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if NVar is less than NDOF when encountering the 'FOPT requested but NVar= XX while NDOF= YY' error?",
    "answer": "If NVar is less than NDOF, it usually means the z-matrix has too many constraints for the actual symmetry."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Unable to project read-in occupied orbitals' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error occurs when a molecular-orbital guess is read from a checkpoint file, but the projection from the old to the new basis set fails, often due to pseudopotential basis sets like CEP-121G* being used with non-existent polarization functions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve the 'Unable to project read-in occupied orbitals' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "To fix this, avoid using CEP-121G* and instead use CEP-121G for the relevant elements, as they are often the same. A workaround is not to use the guess."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the error 'KLT.ge.NIJTC in GetRSB' signify in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error indicates that an MP2 calculation has failed, possibly related to a pseudopotential problem."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I fix the 'KLT.ge.NIJTC in GetRSB' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "To resolve this, do not use CEP-121G* basis sets; instead, use CEP-121G for the relevant elements, as they are often the same."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Symbol XXX not found in Z-matrix' error mean in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This is an input error, meaning a variable name typed in the input is not present in the z-matrix."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I fix the 'Symbol XXX not found in Z-matrix' error?",
    "answer": "You should either type the correct symbol or add the missing variable to the z-matrix."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the cause of the 'Variable X has invalid number of steps' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This input error typically occurs during a rigid potential energy scan when there are two blank lines instead of one between the z-matrix and the variables."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I fix the 'Variable X has invalid number of steps' error?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, delete the extra blank line between the z-matrix and the variables section."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Problem with the distance matrix' error indicate in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error often indicates an input problem where at least two atoms are too close together, or rarely a program error if a distance is NaN, possibly from starting a diatomic optimization with too large a distance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I troubleshoot the 'Problem with the distance matrix' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You should check the z-matrix and variables for the involved atoms to ensure no atoms are too close together, or look for a missing minus sign in a torsion angle causing atoms to become coincident."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'End of file in ZSymb' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This input error occurs when Gaussian cannot find the z-matrix, typically because a blank line was omitted at the end of the geometry specification or `geom=check` was forgotten when intending to read from a checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I fix the 'End of file in ZSymb' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "To fix this, you should either add a blank line at the end of the geometry specification or include `geom=check` in your input."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Linear search skipped for unknown reason' indicate in Gaussian output?",
    "answer": "This error means the rational function optimization was unsuccessful during a linear search, most likely because the Hessian matrix is no longer valid."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve the 'Linear search skipped for unknown reason' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you should restart the optimization using `Opt=CalcFC`."
