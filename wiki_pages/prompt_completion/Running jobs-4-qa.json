    "question": "How do you start an interactive session on a compute node?",
    "answer": "You can start an interactive session on a compute node with `salloc`. An example command is: `salloc --time=1:0:0 --mem-per-cpu=3G --ntasks=1 --account=def-someuser`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you run graphical programs interactively on a compute node?",
    "answer": "It is possible to run graphical programs interactively on a compute node by adding the `--x11` flag to your `salloc` command. For this to work, you must first connect to the cluster with X11 forwarding enabled."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the duration of an interactive job affect its start time?",
    "answer": "An interactive job with a duration of three hours or less will likely start very soon after submission on dedicated test nodes. Interactive jobs requesting more than three hours run on regular nodes and may wait for many hours or even days before starting."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you check the status of your own jobs in Slurm?",
    "answer": "You can list only your own jobs using `squeue -u $USER` or the utility `sq`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you display only running jobs?",
    "answer": "To show only running jobs, use the command `squeue -u <username> -t RUNNING`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you display only pending jobs?",
    "answer": "To show only pending jobs, use the command `squeue -u <username> -t PENDING`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you get detailed information for a specific Slurm job?",
    "answer": "You can show detailed information for a specific job using `scontrol show job <jobid>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to run `squeue` from a script at high frequency?",
    "answer": "No, it is not recommended to run `squeue` from a script or program at high frequency (e.g., every few seconds), as it adds load to Slurm and may interfere with its performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you set up email notifications for job conditions?",
    "answer": "You can ask to be notified by email of certain job conditions by supplying options to `sbatch`, such as `#SBATCH --mail-user=your.email@example.com` and `#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What caution should be exercised when enabling email notifications for jobs?",
    "answer": "You should not turn on email notification options unless you intend to read the emails they generate, as generating a huge volume of unnecessary emails can lead to email service providers restricting mail flow."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is output buffering in non-interactive Slurm jobs?",
    "answer": "Output from a non-interactive Slurm job is normally buffered, meaning there's a delay between when data is written by the job and when you can see the output on a login node. This delay can range from less than a second to many minutes or until the job completes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you monitor the output from a job in real time?",
    "answer": "If you need to monitor the output from a job in real time, it is recommended to run an interactive job."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you get a summary of a job's CPU and memory efficiency?",
    "answer": "You can get a short summary of the CPU and memory efficiency of a job with the `seff` command, for example: `seff 12345678`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you get detailed information about a completed job?",
    "answer": "You can find more detailed information about a completed job with `sacct -j <jobid>`, and optionally control what it prints using `--format`, such as `sacct -j <jobid> --format=JobID,JobName,MaxRSS,Elapsed`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the labels `.bat+`, `.ext+`, and `.0` mean in `sacct` output?",
    "answer": "In `sacct` output, `.bat+` refers to the batch step (your submission script), `.ext+` is the extern step (prologue and epilogue), and a `.0` step (or similar) is created if `srun` is used in your submission script, consuming most of the resources."
