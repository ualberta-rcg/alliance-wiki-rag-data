    "question": "What is the primary benefit of a volume compared to ephemeral storage for a VM?",
    "answer": "A volume provides storage which is not destroyed when a VM is terminated, ensuring data persistence."
  },
  {
    "question": "What storage technology do volumes utilize on the clouds mentioned?",
    "answer": "Volumes use Ceph storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do volumes ensure data safety against hardware failure?",
    "answer": "Volumes use either a 3-fold replication factor or erasure codes to provide safety against hardware failure."
  },
  {
    "question": "On Arbutus, what storage method does the 'Default' volume type use?",
    "answer": "On Arbutus, the 'Default' volume type uses erasure codes for data safety, which also helps reduce extra storage costs compared to 3-fold replication."
  },
  {
    "question": "What storage method is used by the 'OS or Database' volume type on Arbutus?",
    "answer": "The 'OS or Database' volume type on Arbutus still uses the 3-fold replication factor."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more documentation about OpenStack volumes?",
    "answer": "More documentation about OpenStack volumes can be found at https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/cli/cli-manage-volumes.html."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to create a volume?",
    "answer": "To create a volume, you need to click on the 'Create Volume' button and fill in specific fields."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the required fields when creating a volume?",
    "answer": "The required fields when creating a volume are Volume Name, Volume Source, Type, Size (GiB), and Availability Zone. Description is optional."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended 'Volume Source' for an empty volume?",
    "answer": "The recommended 'Volume Source' for an empty volume is 'No source, empty volume'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical 'Availability Zone' option when creating a volume?",
    "answer": "The only typical 'Availability Zone' option is 'nova'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'attaching' a volume?",
    "answer": "Attaching is the process of associating a volume with a VM, similar to plugging an external drive into a computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you initiate the process of attaching a volume from the dashboard?",
    "answer": "From the Volumes page in the dashboard, locate the volume, go to the 'Actions' column, and select 'Manage Attachments' from the drop-down menu."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the final step after selecting a VM in the 'Attach to Instance' menu?",
    "answer": "After selecting a VM, you must click on the blue 'Attach Volume' button."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where will an attached volume typically appear on the VM?",
    "answer": "The attached volume will typically appear on the selected VM on `/dev/vdb` or a similar location."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should you avoid formatting a volume?",
    "answer": "You should NOT format a volume if you are attaching an existing volume that has been previously used to store data, as it would have already been formatted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the process of 'formatting' a volume entail?",
    "answer": "Formatting erases all existing information on a volume and prepares it to store directories and files."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it necessary to format a volume?",
    "answer": "Before a newly created and attached volume can be used, it must be formatted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'mounting' a volume?",
    "answer": "Mounting is the process of mapping the volume's directory and file structure logically within the VM's directory and file structure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example command for mounting a volume?",
    "answer": "An example command to mount a volume is `[name@server ~]$ sudo mount /dev/vdb1 /mnt`, though the device name and mount point may vary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to a mounted volume after a virtual machine reboots?",
    "answer": "When a virtual machine reboots, the volume will need to be re-mounted using the same `mount` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can volumes be configured to mount automatically when a VM boots?",
    "answer": "Volumes can be configured to mount automatically by editing the `/etc/fstab` file to include details about how the volume should be mounted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to view mounting information, such as UUIDs, for devices?",
    "answer": "The `blkid` command is used to view mounting information."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example line to add to `/etc/fstab` for auto-mounting using UUID?",
    "answer": "An example line is `/dev/disk/by-uuid/anananan-anan-anana-anan-ananananana /mnt auto defaults,nofail 0 3`, where the UUID should be replaced with the actual device UUID."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it safer to boot a VM from a volume than from an image?",
    "answer": "Booting from a volume is safer because volume storage has redundancy, which protects the VM from hardware failure, unlike an image stored on the local disk of the machine running the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of VM flavors are typically used when booting from a volume?",
    "answer": "Typically, VM flavors starting with the letter 'p' are used when booting from a volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the different ways to boot a VM from a volume?",
    "answer": "You can boot from an image (creating a new volume), boot from a pre-existing volume, or boot from a volume snapshot (creating a new volume)."
  },
  {
    "question": "If you are new to booting from a volume, which option is available to you?",
    "answer": "If you have not done this before, booting from an image and creating a new volume is your only option."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you ensure a volume created during the VM launch process remains after the VM is terminated?",
    "answer": "To ensure the volume remains longer than the VM, make sure that the 'Delete on Terminate' box is not checked when creating the volume as part of the VM launch process."
