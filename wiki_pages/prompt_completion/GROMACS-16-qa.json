    "question": "What is the purpose of gmx_MMPBSA?",
    "answer": "gmx_MMPBSA is a tool based on AMBER's MMPBSA.py, designed to perform end-state free energy calculations using GROMACS files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does gmx_MMPBSA's compatibility with GROMACS compare to G_MMPBSA?",
    "answer": "Unlike the older G_MMPBSA, which is only compatible with older versions of GROMACS, gmx_MMPBSA can be used with current versions of GROMACS and AmberTools."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any known accuracy concerns when using gmx_MMPBSA for free energy calculations?",
    "answer": "Yes, gmx_MMPBSA uses implicit solvents, and studies have indicated potential issues with the accuracy of these methods for calculating binding free energies."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does the provided submission script typically install gmx_MMPBSA?",
    "answer": "The provided submission script installs and executes gmx_MMPBSA in a temporary directory on the local disk of a compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the requirement for MPI tasks when using the gmx_MMPBSA submission script?",
    "answer": "All MPI tasks must be on one node. For multi-node submissions, a virtual environment should be installed on a shared filesystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are required to run gmx_MMPBSA version 1.6.3 with GROMACS 2024.4 in StdEnv/2023 according to the submission script?",
    "answer": "The required modules are `StdEnv/2023`, `ambertools/23.5`, and `gromacs/2024.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it necessary to install gmx_MMPBSA into a permanent directory?",
    "answer": "gmx_MMPBSA needs to be installed in a permanent directory if you intend to use interactive visualization."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to install gmx_MMPBSA for GROMACS 2024 (StdEnv/2023) for interactive use?",
    "answer": "First, load the modules `StdEnv/2023`, `ambertools/23.5`, `gromacs/2024.4`, and `qt/5.15.11`. Then, create a virtual environment named `venv-gmxMMPBSA`, activate it, and install gmx_MMPBSA version 1.6.3 using `pip install --no-index gmx_MMPBSA==1.6.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one test the gmx_MMPBSA installation for GROMACS 2024?",
    "answer": "To test, clone the gmx_MMPBSA GitHub repository, navigate to the `examples/Protein_DNA` directory, and run the provided command: `gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ct com_traj.xtc -ci index.ndx -cg 3 4 -cp topol.top -o FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat -eo FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv -no -nogui`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the installation procedure for gmx_MMPBSA with GROMACS 2021 (StdEnv/2020)?",
    "answer": "First, purge modules, then load `StdEnv/2020`, `gcc/9.3.0`, `python/3.8`, `gromacs/2021.4`, and `ambertools/21`. Create and activate a virtual environment, then update pip and install `numpy==1.22.2`, `seaborn==0.13.1`, `gmx_MMPBSA==1.5.0.3`, and `ParmEd==3.4.4` using `pip install --no-index`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should the Qt/PyQt module be loaded when installing gmx_MMPBSA for GROMACS 2021 (StdEnv/2020)?",
    "answer": "The Qt/PyQt module (`qt/5.15.2`) needs to be loaded after the virtual environment for gmx_MMPBSA with GROMACS 2021 is ready."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the gmx_MMPBSA application be tested after installation for GROMACS 2021?",
    "answer": "After installation, you can test the application by running `gmx_MMPBSA -h` and `gmx_MMPBSA_test -ng -n 4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can gmx_MMPBSA self-tests be run on the login node?",
    "answer": "Yes, running the self-test for gmx_MMPBSA is very quick, so it is permissible to run them on the login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended module loading and virtual environment activation sequence for using gmx_MMPBSA in a job with GROMACS 2021?",
    "answer": "First, purge all modules. Then, load `StdEnv/2020`, `gcc/9.3.0`, `python/3.8`, `ambertools/21`, `gromacs/2021.4`, and `qt/5.15.2`. Finally, activate the `venv_gmxMMPBSA` virtual environment."
