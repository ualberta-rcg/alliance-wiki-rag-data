  {
    "question": "Why is it important to review the output of `terraform plan`?",
    "answer": "It is definitely required to check the output of `terraform plan` before applying changes to ensure there are no surprises."
  },
  {
    "question": "What might cause an 'incomplete credentials' error when running Terraform?",
    "answer": "If you get an error about incomplete credentials, you may have forgotten to define `OS_CLOUD` or source the RC file, or your `clouds.yaml` file may be missing."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a Terraform plan, what do values marked as `known after apply` signify?",
    "answer": "Values marked `known after apply` will be determined from the state of newly created resources queried from OpenStack after the Terraform plan is applied."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which part of the `terraform plan` output should be double-checked before applying changes?",
    "answer": "Before applying changes, you should at least double-check the last line of the plan, which indicates the number of resources to add, change, or destroy (e.g., 'Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy')."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does Terraform manage or affect existing OpenStack resources that were not created using Terraform?",
    "answer": "No, Terraform has no knowledge of resources already defined in the project that were not created by it and does not attempt to determine existing state, thus it will not affect those resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to import existing OpenStack resources into Terraform?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to import previously defined OpenStack resources into Terraform, but the document notes that it is 'not a trivial amount of work' and is outside the scope of this tutorial."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to apply the changes described in a Terraform plan to OpenStack?",
    "answer": "You use `terraform apply` to actually effect the changes described in the plan."
  },
  {
    "question": "What input is required to confirm the execution of changes when running `terraform apply`?",
    "answer": "When running `terraform apply`, you must type 'yes' when prompted to approve the actions Terraform plans to perform."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Multiple possible networks found' error during OpenStack server creation with Terraform?",
    "answer": "This error occurs because OpenStack projects have at least two networks defined (one private and one public), and Terraform needs to know which specific network to use."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'Multiple possible networks found' error be resolved when defining an OpenStack VM in Terraform?",
    "answer": "To resolve this error, you need to add a `network` resource sub-block to your VM definition, specifying the name of the private network, for example: `network { name = \"my-tenant-net\" }`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you identify the name of your project's private network in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "The name of the private network can be found using the OpenStack CLI command `network list` or by checking under `Network -> Networks` in Horizon. They are typically on a 192.168.X.Y network."
