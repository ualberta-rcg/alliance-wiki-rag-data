  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of reviewing the output of `terraform plan`?",
    "answer": "Reading the `terraform plan` output is required to check before applying changes, ensuring there are no surprises and that the resulting state aligns with expectations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `known after apply` mean in a Terraform plan?",
    "answer": "Values marked as `known after apply` will be determined from the state of newly created resources queried from OpenStack after the plan is successfully applied."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are common causes for 'incomplete credentials' errors when using Terraform with OpenStack?",
    "answer": "Errors about incomplete credentials typically mean you've forgotten to define `OS_CLOUD`, source the RC file, or your `clouds.yaml` file may be missing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be checked in the final line of a `terraform plan` output?",
    "answer": "The last line, such as 'Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy,' should be double-checked to ensure the number of resources to be added, changed, or destroyed matches your intentions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does Terraform manage or affect existing OpenStack resources not defined in its configuration?",
    "answer": "No, Terraform has no knowledge of resources already defined in the project that are not part of its configuration and will not affect them."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you apply the configuration changes described in a Terraform plan?",
    "answer": "You use the `terraform apply` command to actually effect the changes described in the plan."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might `terraform apply` fail with an error indicating 'Multiple possible networks found'?",
    "answer": "This error occurs because OpenStack projects typically have at least two networks (one private and one public), and Terraform needs to be explicitly told which network to use for the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you identify the name of your private network in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "The private network name can be found using the OpenStack CLI command `network list` or on Horizon under `Network -> Networks`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify a network for a VM definition in Terraform?",
    "answer": "To specify a network, you add a `network` resource sub-block to your VM definition, typically including the `name` attribute, such as `name = \"my-tenant-net\"`."
