    "question": "Can I use the example public key provided in the document for my own SSH connection?",
    "answer": "No, you must generate your own pair of public and private keys; you cannot copy the example for your own use."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if my public key, generated by PuTTY or MobaXterm, is in a different format than the example?",
    "answer": "If your public key format is different (e.g., from PuTTY or MobaXterm), open PuTTY Key Generator or MobaXterm SSH Key Generator, go to 'File --> Load private key', and grab the content under 'Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example of a public key in PEM format?",
    "answer": "A public key in PEM format begins with `-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----` and ends with `-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----`, with base64 encoded data in between."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the third step (STEP 3) for installing an SSH public key via the CCDB form?",
    "answer": "STEP 3 is to upload your SSH public key into the CCDB form by pasting the public portion of your key and providing a description to help you track it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after I click 'Add Key' in the CCDB form?",
    "answer": "After clicking 'Add Key,' your SSH key will appear in the section below the form."
  },
  {
    "question": "Once my public key is loaded into CCDB, which systems can I use it to log in to?",
    "answer": "Once your public key is loaded into CCDB, you can use it to log in to any of our clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can OpenStack cloud systems access SSH keys that have been entered into the CCDB?",
    "answer": "No, OpenStack cloud systems cannot access the keys entered in the CCDB."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does it typically take for changes to public keys to propagate to clusters after being updated in CCDB?",
    "answer": "Changes to public keys will often propagate to clusters in a few minutes, but in some cases, it can take up to approximately 30 minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do public keys in RFC4716 or PKCS8 formats differ from PEM format?",
    "answer": "Public keys in RFC4716 or PKCS8 formats will look similar to PEM, but with small variations in their header and footer lines."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will the method of installing SSH keys using the `authorized_keys` file always be supported?",
    "answer": "Support for this method might eventually be withdrawn."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a benefit of using the CCDB method for installing public keys?",
    "answer": "The CCDB method makes your public key available on all of our HPC systems, which is convenient and often desired."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I install an SSH key to work only on a specific system rather than all HPC systems?",
    "answer": "You can install a key only on a specific system by adding the public key to a file in your `/home` directory on that system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the file path for installing an SSH key specifically on Cedar for login access?",
    "answer": "To install a key that only works on Cedar, copy your public key into the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on Cedar."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is most convenient for installing a public key to an `authorized_keys` file on OpenSSH systems?",
    "answer": "On OpenSSH systems, the `ssh-copy-id` command is the most convenient way, for example, `ssh-copy-id -i computecanada-key username@cedar.computecanada.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the `authorized_keys` mechanism considered somewhat fragile despite being standard?",
    "answer": "The `authorized_keys` mechanism is considered somewhat fragile because SSH is quite picky about the permissions on the `authorized_keys` file, your `/home` directory, and the `.ssh` subdirectory."
