    "question": "Can I use the example public SSH key provided in the document for my own use?",
    "answer": "No, you must generate your own pair of public and private keys; you cannot copy the example provided for your own use."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if my SSH public key format is different, such as when generated with PuTTY?",
    "answer": "If your key format is different (e.g., from PuTTY or MobaXterm), open the respective Key Generator, go to `File --> Load private key`, and then copy the content under `Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example of a public key format that might need conversion before uploading to CCDB?",
    "answer": "A public key in PEM format, like the example shown, would need to be converted before proceeding to the upload step."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the third step for installing your SSH public key using the CCDB form?",
    "answer": "Step 3 involves uploading your SSH public key into the CCDB form by pasting the public portion of your key and providing a description for it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after I click 'Add Key' in the CCDB form?",
    "answer": "After clicking 'Add Key', your SSH key will appear in the section below the form."
  },
  {
    "question": "Once my public key is loaded into CCDB, where can I use it to log in?",
    "answer": "Once your public key is loaded into CCDB, you can use it to log in to any of our clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can OpenStack cloud systems access SSH keys that have been entered into the CCDB?",
    "answer": "No, our OpenStack cloud systems cannot access the keys entered in the CCDB."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does it typically take for public key changes to propagate to clusters after being updated in CCDB?",
    "answer": "Changes to public keys will often propagate to clusters in a few minutes, but in some cases, it can take up to approximately 30 minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What other public key formats are similar to PEM?",
    "answer": "Public keys in RFC4716 or PKCS8 formats will look similar to PEM, with small variations in the header and footer lines."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a benefit of using the CCDB method for SSH key installation?",
    "answer": "The CCDB method makes your public key available on all of our HPC systems, which is convenient and often desired."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I install an SSH key on only a specific system instead of all HPC systems?",
    "answer": "You can install an SSH key on only a specific system by adding the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file in your /home directory on that particular system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is most convenient for installing an SSH key on a specific system with OpenSSH?",
    "answer": "The `ssh-copy-id` command is the most convenient way to do this, for example: `ssh-copy-id -i alliance-key username@fir.alliancecan.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the `authorized_keys` mechanism considered somewhat fragile for SSH key installation?",
    "answer": "The `authorized_keys` mechanism is somewhat fragile because SSH is quite picky about the permissions on the `authorized_keys` file, as well as your /home directory and the `.ssh` subdirectory."
