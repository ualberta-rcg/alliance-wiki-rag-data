    "question": "What is a key requirement for VisIt client-server visualization?",
    "answer": "VisIt requires the same major version on the local client and the remote host."
  },
  {
    "question": "What typically happens if the VisIt client and server have different major versions?",
    "answer": "Incompatibility typically shows as a failed handshake when establishing the client-server connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check the installed VisIt versions on the Fir, Nibi, and Rorqual clusters?",
    "answer": "You can see the installed VisIt versions by running `module spider visit`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which major versions of VisIt are required on a laptop for client-server mode with clusters like Fir, Nibi, or Rorqual?",
    "answer": "To use remote VisIt in client-server mode, your laptop needs a matching major version, either 2.12.x, 2.13.x, or 3.2.x."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can you download the host profile XML file for connecting to VisIt 3.2.1 on Fir?",
    "answer": "You can download the host profile XML file `host_fir.xml` from `https://nextcloud.computecanada.ca/index.php/s/aGeScGwF8RKJJji/download`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should the `host_fir.xml` file be copied on Linux/Mac systems?",
    "answer": "On Linux/Mac, copy the file to `~/.visit/hosts/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should the `host_fir.xml` file be copied on Windows systems?",
    "answer": "On Windows, copy the file to `My Documents\\VisIt 3.2.1\\hosts` or a similar directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you verify if the 'fir' host profile is loaded in VisIt on your laptop?",
    "answer": "After starting VisIt, go to `Options -> Host Profiles` in the main menu, and you should see the `fir` host profile."
  },
  {
    "question": "What settings are required to configure remote rendering on Nibi instead of Fir?",
    "answer": "To configure remote rendering on Nibi, set `Host nickname = nibi` and `Remote host name = nibi.alliancecan.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What username should be set for both Fir and Nibi connections?",
    "answer": "You should set your CCDB username, specifically `Username = yourOwwUserName`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What two launch profiles are available in VisIt's setup window for Fir, Nibi, and Rorqual?",
    "answer": "The two available launch profiles are `login` and `slurm`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the 'login' profile used for in VisIt on Fir, Nibi, and Rorqual?",
    "answer": "The `login` profile is for running the engine on a login node, which is not recommended for heavy visualizations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the 'slurm' profile used for in VisIt on Fir, Nibi, and Rorqual?",
    "answer": "The `slurm` profile is for running the engine inside an interactive job on a compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure the 'slurm' profile for your default allocation?",
    "answer": "Select the `slurm` profile, go to the `Parallel` tab, then `Advanced` tab, and replace `--account=def-someuser` with your default allocation in the `Launcher arguments` field."
  },
  {
    "question": "What additional flag should be added for jobs launched on Fir from a scratch directory?",
    "answer": "On Fir only, add the flag `--chdir=/scratch/username` (specifying your actual username) to launch your job from your scratch directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you save VisIt settings so they take effect?",
    "answer": "Save the settings using `Options -> Save Settings` and then exit VisIt on your laptop."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required if your account has multifactor authentication enabled for connecting to the cluster?",
    "answer": "You need to configure your SSH client with ControlMaster and make sure to use the full host name for Host."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example of SSH client configuration for multifactor authentication with ControlMaster for `fir.alliancecan.ca`.",
    "answer": "```Host fir.alliancecan.ca\n    HostName fir.alliancecan.ca\n    User <your user name on the cluster>\n    ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p\n    ControlMaster auto\n    ControlPersist 10m```"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to establish a connection after configuring VisIt settings and potentially SSH client for MFA?",
    "answer": "Next, log into the cluster in a terminal window. Finally, relaunch VisIt on your computer, start the file-open dialogue, and change the local host to `fir` (or `nibi`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What options are you prompted to select when establishing a VisIt connection to the cluster?",
    "answer": "You will be prompted to select either the `login` profile (rendering on the login node) or the `slurm` profile (rendering inside an interactive Slurm job on a compute node)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What parameters must be specified if the 'slurm' profile is selected for rendering?",
    "answer": "If the `slurm` profile is selected, you will need to specify the number of nodes and processors and the maximum time limit."
  },
  {
    "question": "What action initiates the VisIt engine startup, and how long might it take for compute node rendering?",
    "answer": "Clicking 'OK' initiates the VisIt engine startup. If rendering on a compute node, it may take some time for your job to get started."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you know when the VisIt engine is successfully running?",
    "answer": "The VisIt engine is running once your dataset appears in the `Active source`."
