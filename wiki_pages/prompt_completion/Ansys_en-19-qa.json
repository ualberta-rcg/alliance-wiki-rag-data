  {
    "question": "What alternative is available if a researcher needs more than 512 HPC cores for their Ansys research?",
    "answer": "If you need more than 512 HPC cores, consider using a local ANSYS License server at your institution if one is available and contributing towards expanding it if necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of purchasing an Ansys license subscription from CMC?",
    "answer": "Benefits include: no need for a local institutional license server, no physical license to obtain and reconfigure annually, portability (can be used almost anywhere), and installation instructions for Windows machines to run SpaceClaim (not possible on Linux-based Alliance clusters)."

    "question": "How do I configure my `ansys.lic` file to use the SHARCNET Ansys license on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "Create or edit `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` with these two lines: `setenv(\"ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE\", \"1055@license3.sharcnet.ca\")` and `setenv(\"ANSYSLI_SERVERS\", \"2325@license3.sharcnet.ca\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check the number of SHARCNET Ansys licenses in use by my username and all users?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I find Ansys licenses unexpectedly in use by my username on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Connect to the node where it's running (gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca or gra-vdi4.sharcnet.ca via VNC), open a terminal, and run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys\"` to terminate the rogue processes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might Ansys licenses be unexpectedly tied up on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Rogue processes can persistently tie up licenses if an Ansys GUI session (Fluent, Workbench, etc.) is not cleanly terminated by the user, for example, before `vncviewer` is terminated manually or unexpectedly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What options do researchers have for loading Ansys modules when using gra-vdi?",

  {
    "question": "When are settings from `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` used with local Ansys modules on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Settings from `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` are only used when `-gui` is appended to the Ansys program name, e.g., `fluent-gui` instead of `fluent`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is considered suitable usage for Ansys on gra-vdi when using local modules?",
    "answer": "Suitable usage includes running a single job interactively (in the GUI or command line) with up to 8 cores and 128GB RAM, creating/modifying simulation input files, and post-processing or visualizing data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to load and use a local Ansys module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "1. Connect to `gra-vdi.computecanada.ca` with TigerVNC. 2. Open a new terminal and load a module, e.g., `module load SnEnv ansys/2024R2`. 3. Directly start one of the Ansys programs from the command line, e.g., `runwb2-gui`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What options become available when starting `cfx5-gui` from local Ansys modules on gra-vdi?",
