  {
    "question": "How is the SHARCNET Ansys license distributed to researchers?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET Ansys license is made available on a first-come, first-served basis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the current usage limits for the SHARCNET Ansys license per researcher?",
    "answer": "Each researcher is currently permitted to run a maximum of 8 simultaneous jobs, utilizing up to 512 HPC cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide examples of core combinations allowed under the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "Examples of maximum even-sized core combinations that can be run simultaneously include 1x512, 2x256, 4x128, or 8x64 across all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a possibility of license shortages with the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "Yes, since the license is oversubscribed, there is a potential for a shortage of anshpc licenses to develop."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if a job fails to start due to a SHARCNET license shortage?",
    "answer": "If a job fails on startup due to a shortage of licenses, it will need to be manually resubmitted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What measures might be taken if frequent SHARCNET license shortages are reported?",
    "answer": "If many instances of license shortages are reported, the total job limit per researcher may be decreased (to 6 or 4) and/or the total HPC core limit per researcher may be decreased (to 384 or 256 cores)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What alternatives exist if a researcher requires more than 512 HPC cores for Ansys?",
    "answer": "If you need more than 512 HPC cores, you should consider using a local institutional Ansys License server, if available, and potentially contributing to its expansion."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of purchasing an Ansys license subscription from CMC?",
    "answer": "Benefits include not needing a local institutional license server, no annual physical license reconfiguration, portability for use almost anywhere (home, institutions, Alliance clusters), and Windows installation instructions for SpaceClaim."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a potential core limit for users with a CMC Ansys license?",
    "answer": "According to the CMC Ansys Quick Start Guides, there may be a 64-core limit per user."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure the `ansys.lic` file to use the SHARCNET Ansys license on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "You need to configure your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file with `setenv(\"ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE\", \"1055@license3.sharcnet.ca\")` and `setenv(\"ANSYSLI_SERVERS\", \"2325@license3.sharcnet.ca\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user query the number of SHARCNET Ansys licenses in use by their username and all users?",
    "answer": "SSH into `graham.computecanada.ca`, load the `ansys` module, and then run `lmutil lmstat -c $ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE -a | grep \"Users of\\|$USER\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to terminate rogue Ansys processes that are unexpectedly tying up licenses?",
    "answer": "Connect to the node where Ansys is running (e.g., `gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca` or `gra-vdi4.sharcnet.ca` for gra-vdi) and run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys\"` in a terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it necessary to specify the full hostname when connecting to gra-vdi via TigerVNC to terminate rogue processes?",
    "answer": "Gra-vdi consists of two nodes (gra-vdi3 and gra-vdi4), and researchers are randomly placed on them. Specifying the full hostname ensures you log into the correct node before running `pkill`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What options do researchers have for loading Ansys modules when using gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Researchers can load Ansys modules from the global environment (after loading CcEnv) or local modules installed on the machine itself (after loading SnEnv)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might local Ansys modules on gra-vdi be more appealing than standard environment modules?",
    "answer": "Local modules may be of interest because they include some Ansys programs and versions not yet supported by the standard environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "When starting programs from local Ansys modules on gra-vdi, which license servers can be used?",
    "answer": "You can select the CMC license server or continue to use the SHARCNET license server by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what condition are settings from `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` used with local Ansys modules on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Settings from `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` are only used when `dash gui` is appended to the Ansys program name, such as `fluent-gui` instead of `fluent`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended uses and resource limits for Ansys on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Suitable usage includes running a single job interactively (GUI or command line) with up to 8 cores and 128GB RAM, creating or modifying simulation input files, or post-processing/visualizing data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load and start an Ansys program using a local module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Connect to `gra-vdi.computecanada.ca` with TigerVNC, open a new terminal, load a module (e.g., `module load SnEnv ansys/2024R2`), and then directly start the Ansys program from the command line (e.g., `runwb2`, `fluent-gui`)."
