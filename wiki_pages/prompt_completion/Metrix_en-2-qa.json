    "question": "How can I get an initial overview of my task's resource usage?",
    "answer": "You can obtain an initial overview of your task's resource usage in the 'Ressources' section by comparing the 'Allou\u00e9s' (Allocated) and 'Utilis\u00e9s' (Used) columns for the listed parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is shown in the CPU graph?",
    "answer": "The CPU graph allows you to visualize the CPU cores you requested over time. You can select or deselect different cores as needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the CPU graph not available?",
    "answer": "The CPU graph is not available for very short tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the Memory graph display?",
    "answer": "The Memory graph allows you to visualize the usage of the memory you requested over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can be observed in the 'Process and threads' graph?",
    "answer": "The 'Process and threads' graph allows you to observe various parameters related to processes and execution threads, including 'Running threads' and 'Sleeping threads', and applications executed over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal sum for 'Running threads' and 'Sleeping threads' in a multithreading task?",
    "answer": "Ideally, for a multithreading task, the sum of 'Running threads' and 'Sleeping threads' should not exceed twice the number of requested cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are 'Sleeping threads' normal for some programs?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is normal to have some processes in 'Sleeping threads' mode for certain types of programs such as Java, Matlab, commercial software, or complex programs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the filesystem usage graphs represent for a task?",
    "answer": "For a task, the left filesystem graph shows the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS), and the right graph illustrates the data transfer rate between the task and the filesystem over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the data transfer rate graph for filesystems be used?",
    "answer": "This graph allows users to identify periods of intense activity or low utilization of the filesystem by the task."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might resource statistics for an entire node be inaccurate?",
    "answer": "Resource statistics for the entire node may be inaccurate if the node is shared between multiple users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the left graph display regarding task bandwidth?",
    "answer": "The graph on the left shows the evolution of the bandwidth used by the task over time, in relation to software, licenses, etc."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the right graph show concerning network bandwidth for a task?",
    "answer": "The graph on the right shows the evolution of the network bandwidth used by a task or a set of tasks via the Infiniband network, over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can be observed from the network bandwidth graph?",
    "answer": "Periods of massive data transfer, such as reading/writing on a filesystem (Lustre) or MPI communication between nodes, can be observed from the network bandwidth graph."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the local disk usage graphs show?",
    "answer": "The left graph illustrates the evolution of input/output operations per second (IOPS) performed on the local disk over time, while the right graph shows the evolution of local disk bandwidth usage (amount of data read or written per second) over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What other local disk information is available?",
    "answer": "The use of local disk space is also available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the key difference between a CPU task page for a job array and a regular CPU task page?",
    "answer": "A CPU task page for a job array is identical to a regular CPU task page, except for the 'Other jobs in the array' section."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is listed in the 'Other jobs in the array' section?",
    "answer": "This section lists other task numbers belonging to the same job array, along with information on their status, name, start time, and end time."
