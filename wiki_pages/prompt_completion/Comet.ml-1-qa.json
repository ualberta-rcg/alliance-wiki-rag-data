  {
    "question": "What is Comet?",
    "answer": "Comet is a meta machine learning platform designed to help AI practitioners and teams build reliable machine learning models for real-world applications by streamlining the machine learning model lifecycle."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can users do with Comet?",
    "answer": "By using Comet, users can track, compare, explain, and reproduce their machine learning experiments, and it can also greatly accelerate hyperparameter search through Bayesian exploration."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is Comet's availability restricted on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Comet requires an internet connection, which restricts its availability on compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which clusters is Comet available and requires `module load httpproxy`?",
    "answer": "Comet is available on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA clusters, and requires `module load httpproxy`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which clusters support Comet without requiring `httpproxy`?",
    "answer": "Comet is available on Fir, Nibi, Vulcan, and Killarney clusters without requiring `httpproxy`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is Comet not available on the Trillium cluster?",
    "answer": "Comet is not available on the Trillium cluster because internet access is disabled on its compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key best practice for logging metrics when using Comet?",
    "answer": "Users should avoid logging metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) at a high frequency."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can happen if metrics are logged at a high frequency in Comet?",
    "answer": "Logging metrics at a high frequency can cause Comet to throttle your experiment, which can make your job duration harder to predict."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended interval for logging metrics or requesting new hyperparameters?",
    "answer": "As a rule of thumb, users should log metrics or request new hyperparameters at an interval of 1 minute or greater."
