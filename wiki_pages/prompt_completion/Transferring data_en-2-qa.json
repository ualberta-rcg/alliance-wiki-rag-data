  {
    "question": "What is the default behavior of a Globus transfer?",
    "answer": "Normally, a Globus transfer will overwrite files on the destination with files from the source, transferring all files from the source."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I prevent Globus from transferring files that already exist and match on the destination?",
    "answer": "You should go to the 'Transfer & Timer Options' and choose to 'sync' instead of the default transfer behavior."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the slowest but most accurate option for Globus to decide which files to transfer during a sync?",
    "answer": "Globus can decide based on whether their checksums are different. This option catches changes or errors that result in the same file size but different contents."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Globus sync option is useful for incrementally creating files?",
    "answer": "The option 'File doesn't exist on destination' will only transfer files that have been created since the last sync."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Globus use file size to decide if a file needs to be transferred?",
    "answer": "Globus performs a quick test; if the file size is different, its contents must have changed, and it will be re-transferred."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Globus sync option uses modification times to determine file transfers, and what related setting is important?",
    "answer": "The 'Modification time is newer' option checks the file's recorded modification time and only transfers the file if it's newer on the source. If relying on this, it's important to check the 'preserve source file modification times' option during transfer initiation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Rsync used for?",
    "answer": "Rsync is a popular tool for ensuring that two separate datasets (files or directories) are the same."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what conditions can Rsync be slow?",
    "answer": "Rsync can be quite slow if there are a lot of files or if there is a lot of latency between the two sites (e.g., geographically apart or on different networks)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does `rsync` determine by default if a file needs to be transferred?",
    "answer": "By default, `rsync` checks the modification time and size of each file, and will only transfer the file if one or both do not match."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can `rsync` be configured to use checksums instead of modification time and size for file comparison?",
    "answer": "You can use the `-c` option, which will compute checksums at the source and destination, and transfer only if the checksums do not match."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which `rsync` flags should be avoided when transferring files into `/project` file systems, and why?",
    "answer": "Do not use the `-p` (preserve permissions) and `-g` (preserve group) flags when transferring into `/project` file systems, because quotas in `/project` are based on group ownership, and preserving group ownership can lead to 'Disk quota exceeded' errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `rsync` options should be added when using the `-a` (archive) flag for transfers into `/project` file systems?",
    "answer": "Since `-a` includes `-p` and `-g` by default, the `--no-g --no-p` options should be added."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example command for `rsync` to transfer a local file or directory into a project directory on a remote cluster, including recommended flags for `/project` filesystems.",
    "answer": "An example command is `rsync -avzh --no-g --no-p LOCALNAME someuser@graham.alliancecan.ca:projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-z` option in `rsync`?",
    "answer": "The `-z` option compresses files (excluding those in the default `--skip-compress` list) during transfer, requiring additional CPU resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `-h` option do in `rsync`?",
    "answer": "The `-h` option makes transferred file sizes human-readable."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can `rsync` transfers be restarted if they are interrupted, especially for very large files?",
    "answer": "Add the `--partial` option to the `rsync` command, like `rsync -avzh --no-g --no-p --partial --progress LOCALNAME someuser@graham.alliancecan.ca:projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a single progress bar be displayed for an `rsync` transfer involving many smaller files?",
    "answer": "Use the `--info=progress2` option, for example: `rsync -azh --no-g --no-p --info=progress2 LOCALNAME someuser@graham.alliancecan.ca:projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can `rsync` be used to transfer files from a remote system to a local project directory, and if so, how?",
    "answer": "Yes, `rsync` can be used this way, for example: `rsync -avzh --no-g --no-p someuser@graham.alliancecan.ca:REMOTENAME ~/projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/` where REMOTENAME is the path on the remote system."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can `rsync` be used for local file transfers within a single system, such as from a home or scratch directory to a project directory?",
    "answer": "For local transfers, the cluster name can be dropped, like `rsync -avh --no-g --no-p LOCALNAME ~/projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`."
