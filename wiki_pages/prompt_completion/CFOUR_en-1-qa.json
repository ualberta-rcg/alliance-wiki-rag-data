  {
    "question": "What is CFOUR?",
    "answer": "CFOUR (Coupled-Cluster techniques for Computational Chemistry) is a program package designed for performing high-level quantum chemical calculations on atoms and molecules."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the major strength of the CFOUR program suite?",
    "answer": "The major strength of CFOUR is its sophisticated arsenal of high-level ab-initio methods for calculating atomic and molecular properties, including approaches based on M\u00f8ller-Plesset (MP) perturbation theory and the coupled-cluster approximation (CC), often with complementary analytic derivative approaches."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is CFOUR a commercial software?",
    "answer": "No, CFOUR is not a commercial code; it is a program under continuous development with ongoing new techniques and improvements."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who acts for the developers of the CFOUR Software regarding the Alliance's license agreement?",
    "answer": "Prof. Dr. J. Gauss acts for the developers of the CFOUR Software."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the conditions for using CFOUR on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "To use CFOUR on Alliance systems, users must agree to: use it only for academic research, not copy or make the software available to anyone else, properly acknowledge original papers related to CFOUR and the Alliance, understand that the agreement can be terminated, and notify the Alliance of any changes in acknowledgement."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user get access to CFOUR on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "Users must contact support with a copy of their statement agreeing to the specified conditions, after which they will be granted access to the program."
  },
  {
    "question": "What module command is used to access the MPI version of CFOUR?",
    "answer": "To access the MPI version of CFOUR, use the command: `module load intel/2023.2.1 openmpi/4.1.5 cfour-mpi/2.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What module command is used to access the serial version of CFOUR?",
    "answer": "To access the serial version of CFOUR, use the command: `module load intel/2023.2.1 cfour/2.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What input files are required to run CFOUR?",
    "answer": "To run CFOUR, you need at least the ZMAT input file (for geometry, quantum-chemical method, basis set, etc.) and the GENBAS file (for basis set information)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the GENBAS file is missing from the job directory when running CFOUR?",
    "answer": "If GENBAS is not present in the directory where the job starts, CFOUR will create a symlink to use the existing file provided by the module."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the GENBAS file provided by the CFOUR module located?",
    "answer": "The GENBAS file provided by the module is located at: `$EBROOTCFOUR/basis/GENBAS`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the CFOUR program executed in a serial job script?",
    "answer": "In a serial job script, after loading the `intel/2023.2.1 cfour/2.1` module and setting `export CFOUR_NUM_CORES=1`, the program is typically executed using `xcfour > ${CFOUROUTPUT}`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the CFOUR program executed in an MPI job script?",
    "answer": "In an MPI job script, after loading the `intel/2023.2.1 openmpi/4.1.5 cfour-mpi/2.1` module and setting `export CFOUR_NUM_CORES=${SLURM_NTASKS}`, the program is typically executed using `xcfour > ${CFOUROUTPUT}`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a forum for CFOUR user experiences?",
    "answer": "Yes, there is a mailing list that serves as a forum for user experiences with the CFOUR program system."
