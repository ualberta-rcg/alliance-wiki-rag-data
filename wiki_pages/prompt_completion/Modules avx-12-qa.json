    "question": "What is Filtlong used for?",
    "answer": "Filtlong is a tool designed for filtering long reads by quality, producing a smaller, higher-quality subset of reads based on length and identity."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Filtlong filter reads?",
    "answer": "It filters reads using both read length (prioritizing longer reads) and read identity (prioritizing higher identity reads) to select a smaller, better subset."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the version of Filtlong?",
    "answer": "Filtlong is available in version 0.2.0."
  },
