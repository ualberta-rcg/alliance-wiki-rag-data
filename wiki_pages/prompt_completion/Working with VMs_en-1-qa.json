    "question": "What is a virtual machine (VM)?",
    "answer": "A virtual machine (VM) is a virtualized server in the cloud infrastructure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are active virtual machines called in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "In OpenStack, active virtual machines are referred to as instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can VMs be managed?",
    "answer": "VMs can be managed via the OpenStack dashboard."

  {
    "question": "Why is it useful to lock a VM?",
    "answer": "It can be useful to lock a VM when working on a project with multiple people or to protect it from accidental deletion or shutdown."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you lock a VM?",
    "answer": "To lock a VM, click on the \"Lock Instance\" option from the Actions drop-down menu on the dashboard."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when a VM is locked?",
    "answer": "Once a VM is locked, most of the Actions menu items will not be able to be executed until the instance is unlocked. There is also an icon indicating the lock state for every instance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you unlock a VM?",
    "answer": "To unlock a VM, select the \"Unlock Instance\" from the Actions drop-down menu on the dashboard."

  {
    "question": "How can a VM be resized?",
    "answer": "It is possible to resize a VM by changing its flavor."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the considerations when resizing a VM?",
    "answer": "There are some things to be aware of when choosing to resize a VM, which depends on whether you have a \"p\" flavor or a \"c\" flavor VM. Resizing a VM may involve some risk as it is similar to deleting and recreating your VM with a new flavor."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted if there is doubt about resizing a VM?",
    "answer": "If in doubt when resizing a VM, contact cloud technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What distinguishes \"c\" flavor VMs?",
    "answer": "\"c\" flavors often have extra ephemeral drives."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to ephemeral drives when a \"c\" flavor VM is resized?",
    "answer": "The extra ephemeral drives will be resized when you choose a new \"c\" flavor."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can \"c\" flavor VM ephemeral drives be made smaller during a resize?",
    "answer": "No, \"c\" flavor ephemeral drives cannot become smaller."
  },
  {
    "question": "To what types of flavors can \"c\" flavor VMs be resized?",
    "answer": "\"c\" flavor VMs can only be resized to flavors with equal or larger ephemeral drives."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will a larger ephemeral drive be immediately visible after resizing a \"c\" flavor VM?",
    "answer": "No, you will not immediately see a larger ephemeral drive within your VM after resizing (e.g., the `df -h` command will not show the size increase)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you make the extra space visible after resizing a \"c\" flavor VM?",
    "answer": "To see this extra space, you will need to resize your filesystem, for example, using the `resize2fs` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What precautions should be taken before resizing a filesystem?",
    "answer": "Filesystem resizes should be treated with caution, can take considerable time if partitions are large, and it is recommended to create backups of its contents before resizing."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do \"p\" flavors typically have ephemeral drives?",
    "answer": "Unlike \"c\" flavors, \"p\" flavors do not typically have extra ephemeral drives associated with them."
  },
  {
    "question": "To what types of flavors can \"p\" flavor VMs be resized?",
    "answer": "\"p\" flavors can be resized to larger and smaller flavors."
