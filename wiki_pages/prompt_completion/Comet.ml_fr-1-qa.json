    "question": "What is Comet?",
    "answer": "Comet is a machine meta-learning platform that allows building models for concrete applications and facilitates their development and maintenance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main capabilities of the Comet platform?",
    "answer": "The platform allows tracking, comparing, describing, and reproducing experiments, and greatly accelerates hyperparameter research through its Bayesian exploration module."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the use of Comet restricted to certain clusters?",
    "answer": "Because an internet connection is required for its operation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which clusters support the use of Comet?",
    "answer": "Comet is available on Narval, Rorqual, TamIA, Fir, Nibi, Vulcan, and Killarney clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which clusters is 'module load httpproxy' required for Comet?",
    "answer": "'module load httpproxy' is required on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which clusters do not require 'httpproxy' for Comet?",
    "answer": "Fir, Nibi, Vulcan, and Killarney clusters do not require 'httpproxy'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which cluster does not support Comet and why?",
    "answer": "Comet is not available on the Trillium cluster because internet access is disabled on its compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a best practice when interacting with the Comet server?",
    "answer": "It is best to avoid making requests to the Comet server too frequently."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should users avoid making high-frequency requests to the Comet server?",
    "answer": "High-frequency requests could lead Comet to limit the throughput, making the task duration unpredictable."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended interaction interval with Comet?",
    "answer": "Users should interact with Comet at intervals of 1 minute or more (>= 1 minute)."
