  {
    "question": "How can users monitor their jobs on tamIA?",
    "answer": "Users can monitor their jobs from the tamIA portal, either in real time for CPUs and GPUs, or by examining past jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of monitoring jobs on tamIA?",
    "answer": "Monitoring jobs can help users optimize resource usage and shorten wait times in the queue."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific resources can be monitored via the tamIA portal?",
    "answer": "Users can monitor their usage of compute nodes, memory, and GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to adjust resource requests for jobs?",
    "answer": "It is important to adjust resource requests to ensure allocated resources are fully utilized. If requested compute resources are underused (e.g., requesting 4 CPU cores but using only one), users should correct their script files accordingly."
