    "question": "What is the definition of archiving?",
    "answer": "Archiving means creating one file that contains a number of smaller files within it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of archiving data?",
    "answer": "Archiving data can improve the efficiency of file storage, and of file transfers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is archiving beneficial for transfers using scp?",
    "answer": "It is faster for the secure copy protocol (scp) to transfer one archive file of a reasonable size than thousands of small files of equal total size."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does compressing a file mean?",
    "answer": "Compressing means encoding a file such that the same information is contained in fewer bytes of storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary utility used for archiving files and directories on Linux and Unix-like systems?",
    "answer": "The primary archiving utility on all Linux and Unix-like systems is the tar command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the conventional file name extension for an archive file created by `tar`?",
    "answer": "By convention an archive file has `.tar` as the file name extension."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create an archive file named `project1.tar` from a directory named `project1` using the `tar` command?",
    "answer": "You can pack all the contents of directory `project1/` into the file `project1.tar` using the command `tar --create --file project1.tar project1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the original directory after it has been archived using `tar`?",
    "answer": "The original directory will be unchanged, so this may double the amount of disk space occupied!"
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract files from a `tar` archive named `project1.tar`?",
    "answer": "You can extract files from the archive using the command `tar --extract --file project1.tar`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens during `tar` extraction if a directory with the original name does not exist?",
    "answer": "If there is no directory with the original name, it will be created."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens during `tar` extraction if a directory with the original name exists and contains files with the same names as in the archive?",
    "answer": "If a directory of that name exists and contains files of the same names as in the archive file, they will be overwritten."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can `tar` compress an archive file during its creation?",
    "answer": "`tar` can compress an archive file at the same time it creates it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which compression methods are recommended for use with `tar`?",
    "answer": "We recommend either `xz` or `gzip` for compressing `tar` archives."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create an `xz` compressed tar archive named `project1.tar.xz` from `project1`?",
    "answer": "To create an `xz` compressed archive, use `tar --create --xz --file project1.tar.xz project1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract an `xz` compressed tar archive named `project1.tar.xz`?",
    "answer": "To extract an `xz` compressed archive, use `tar --extract --xz --file project1.tar.xz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create a `gzip` compressed tar archive named `project1.tar.gz` from `project1`?",
    "answer": "To create a `gzip` compressed archive, use `tar --create --gzip --file project1.tar.gz project1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a `gzip` compressed tar archive named `project1.tar.gz`?",
    "answer": "To extract a `gzip` compressed archive, use `tar --extract --gzip --file project1.tar.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Compare `xz` and `gzip` compression methods in terms of compression ratio, time, and RAM usage.",
    "answer": "Typically, `--xz` will produce a smaller compressed file (a 'better compression ratio') but takes longer and uses more RAM while working, whereas `--gzip` does not typically compress as small, but may be used if you encounter difficulties due to insufficient memory or excessive run time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can `tar` archiving and compression be done in separate steps?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can run `tar --create` first without compression and then use `xz` or `gzip` in a separate step, although there is rarely a reason to do so."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `tar` option is used to create a new archive?",
    "answer": "The options are `-c` or `--create`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which `tar` option specifies the name of the archive file?",
    "answer": "The options are `-f` or `--file=`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `tar` option is used to extract files from an archive?",
    "answer": "The options are `-x` or `--extract`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which `tar` option is used to list the contents of an archive file?",
    "answer": "The options are `-t` or `--list`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `tar` option enables compression or uncompression with `xz`?",
    "answer": "The options are `-J` or `--xz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `tar` option enables compression or uncompression with `gzip`?",
    "answer": "The options are `-z` or `--gzip`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can single-letter `tar` options be combined?",
    "answer": "Single-letter options can be combined with a single dash, for example `tar -cJf project1.tar.zx project1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you get a complete list of `tar` options available on your system?",
    "answer": "You can get a complete list of the options available on your system with `man tar` or `tar --help`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do all older systems support `tar`'s `--xz` compression option?",
    "answer": "No, some older systems might not support `--xz` compression."
