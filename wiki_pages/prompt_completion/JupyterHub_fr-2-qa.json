    "question": "How do you configure Jupyter server options after connecting to JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "A form allows you to configure Jupyter server options before clicking the 'Start' button."
  },
  {
    "question": "What priority do interactive tasks have on a cluster?",
    "answer": "On each cluster, only one interactive task at a time receives a higher priority to start within a few seconds or minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of tasks are considered interactive on a cluster?",
    "answer": "Interactive tasks include those executed via `salloc`, `srun`, and JupyterHub tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if I'm running another interactive task when starting a new JupyterHub session?",
    "answer": "If you have another interactive task running on the cluster where JupyterHub is located, your new Jupyter session might not start before the 5-minute limit."
  },
  {
    "question": "What compute resources can be configured for JupyterHub on B\u00e9luga?",
    "answer": "Configurable compute resources for JupyterHub on B\u00e9luga include 'Account', 'Time (hours)', 'Number of cores', 'Memory (MB)', 'GPU configuration' (optional), and 'User Interface'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which account types can be used with JupyterHub on B\u00e9luga?",
    "answer": "You can use compute accounts of type `def-*`, `rrg-*`, `rpp-*`, or `ctb-*` to which you have access."
  },
  {
    "question": "What user interface options are available in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "JupyterHub offers JupyterLab (modern), Jupyter Notebook (classic), and Terminal as user interface options."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which JupyterHub interface is recommended for interactive prototyping and data visualization?",
    "answer": "JupyterLab, the modern interface, is the most recommended for interactive prototyping and data visualization."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do most users prefer JupyterLab over Jupyter Notebook?",
    "answer": "Most users choose JupyterLab because it is a better platform with many more features than the classic Jupyter Notebook interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "What functionality does the Terminal interface in JupyterHub provide?",
    "answer": "The Terminal interface gives access to a remote account terminal, comparable to connecting to a server via SSH."
  },
  {
    "question": "What usually causes 'Spawn failed: Timeout' errors in JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "Errors with JupyterHub, specifically 'Spawn failed: Timeout', are generally caused by the underlying task scheduler not responding or being unable to find appropriate resources for your session."
  },
  {
    "question": "When does the 'Spawn failed: Timeout' message appear for a JupyterHub session?",
    "answer": "If the interactive task submitted automatically by JupyterHub to the cluster does not start within five minutes, the 'Spawn failed: Timeout' message is displayed, and the session is canceled."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can requesting more resources impact the start of a JupyterHub session?",
    "answer": "Requesting more execution time, a GPU, or too many CPU cores can lead to a longer waiting period before the task can start."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do if your Jupyter session is queued due to another interactive task on the same cluster?",
    "answer": "If possible, stop or cancel other interactive tasks before using JupyterHub to allow your session to start."
  },
  {
    "question": "What action should be taken if no resources are available for a JupyterHub session?",
    "answer": "Check the 'System Status' page for any reported issues and try again later."
