    "answer": "Compute instances are instances with a limited life-time, typically having constant high-CPU requirements for their duration, and are also referred to as 'batch' instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do compute instances receive higher vCPU/Memory quotas?",
    "answer": "Compute instances receive higher vCPU/Memory quotas because they are time-limited instances."

    "answer": "Persistent instances are meant to run indefinitely, depending on the cloud's availability, and include services like web servers and database servers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical CPU characteristics of persistent instances?",
    "answer": "Persistent instances are generally thought to be lower CPU or bursty CPU instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do persistent instances have lower vCPU/Memory quotas?",
    "answer": "Persistent instances have lower vCPU/Memory quotas because they are meant to consume resources for long periods of time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does persistent cloud storage provide?",
    "answer": "Persistent cloud storage provides virtual disk functionality to virtual machines running in the cloud."
  },
  {

    "answer": "Persistent cloud storage is made very reliable and scalable by specialized software called Ceph."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Floating IP?",
    "answer": "A Floating IP is a public IP address that a project can associate with a Virtual Machine (VM) to ensure the instance has the same public IP address each time it boots."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are Floating IPs used to maintain consistent IP addresses for VMs?",
    "answer": "Users create a pool of floating IP addresses and assign them to instances as they are launched to maintain a consistent IP address for DNS assignment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an 'Instance' in a cloud environment?",
    "answer": "An 'Instance' is a running Virtual Machine (VM), or a VM in a known state like suspended, that can be used like a hardware server."

    "answer": "Use cases for ephemeral disks include VMs with cached data for short usage, VMs hosting applications that replicate data across multiple VMs, or VMs whose persistent data is saved on a volume or external storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What storage do ephemeral local disks utilize?",
    "answer": "Ephemeral local disks use storage directly attached to a virtualization host."
  },
  {

    "answer": "No, ephemeral local disks are not expected to survive if the hardware fails, unlike volumes backed by a resilient storage cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is an ephemeral local disk purged and deleted?",
    "answer": "An ephemeral local disk is purged and deleted when the instance itself is deleted by the cloud user or by the admin."

    "answer": "Service portals generally do not require large computing or storage resources, but may need support from the technical team."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do groups applying for a service portal often use and require?",
    "answer": "Groups applying for a service portal often use the cloud, generally require a public IP address, and may have more stringent up-time requirements than typical research projects."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the option for a service portal called in the online form?",
    "answer": "The option for a service portal is shown as 'Portal' in the online form."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?",
