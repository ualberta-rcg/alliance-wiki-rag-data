    "question": "How can I request a specific GPU node type, like a T4 GPU, using the `salloc` command?",
    "answer": "To request a T4 GPU node, you would use the `salloc` command with the `--gpus-per-node=t4:1` option. For example: `salloc --time=1:00:00 --cpus-per-task=4 --gpus-per-node=t4:1 --mem=16000 --account=def-piname`."
