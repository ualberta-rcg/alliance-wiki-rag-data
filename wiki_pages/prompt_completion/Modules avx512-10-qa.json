  {
    "question": "What is bgen-lib?",
    "answer": "bgen-lib is a C++ library that provides a reference implementation of the BGEN format, used as a basis for BGEN support in other software or as a reference for developers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which utilities are included in the bgen-lib repository?",
    "answer": "The bgen-lib repository includes utilities like bgenix for indexing and retrieving BGEN file subsets, cat-bgen for concatenating BGEN files, and edit-bgen for editing BGEN file metadata."
