    "question": "What is the purpose of the Structure software package?",
    "answer": "Structure is a free software package used for investigating population structure with multilocus genotype data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some specific applications of the Structure software?",
    "answer": "Its applications include inferring distinct populations, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, identifying migrants and admixed individuals, and estimating population allele frequencies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of genetic markers can be analyzed using Structure?",
    "answer": "Structure can be applied to commonly-used genetic markers such as SNPS, microsatellites, RFLPs, and AFLPs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of Structure is installed, and what is its module name?",
    "answer": "Structure v2.3.4 is installed, and its module name is `structure/2.3.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find an up-to-date list of installed Structure versions?",
    "answer": "Users can find an up-to-date list of installed versions on the 'Available software' page for the `structure` module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What three files does Structure expect in the current working directory when started without command-line options?",
    "answer": "Structure expects to find `mainparams`, `extraparams`, and a data file in the current working directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the name of the data file be specified when running Structure?",
    "answer": "The data file name can be set using the `INFILE` parameter in `mainparams` or supplied via the command line using the `-i` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find detailed documentation on Structure's parameters and file formats?",
    "answer": "A complete description of available parameters and file-formats can be found in &sect;7 'Running ''structure'' from the command line' in the Structure Documentation for version 2.3.4."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there command-line options to override default filenames in Structure?",
    "answer": "Yes, there are several command-line options to supply alternative filenames or override options, such as -m (mainparams), -e (extraparams), -i (input file), and -o (output file)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Structure run in parallel on its own?",
    "answer": "No, Structure in itself is not able to run in parallel."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tools are recommended for running multiple Structure analyses in parallel, especially with the Evanno-method?",
    "answer": "The tools StrAuto and StructureHarvester have been developed to automate the process of setting up and aggregating results for multiple Structure runs, especially when using the Evanno-method."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is StrAuto used for in the context of Structure analysis?",
    "answer": "StrAuto is a tool designed to automate and parallelize STRUCTURE analysis, particularly when population structure inference involves multiple runs using methods like Evanno."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is StructureHarvester used for?",
    "answer": "StructureHarvester is used to aggregate the results from multiple Structure runs."
