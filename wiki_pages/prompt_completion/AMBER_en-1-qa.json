    "question": "What is Amber?",
    "answer": "Amber is the collective name for a suite of programs that allow users to perform molecular dynamics simulations, particularly on biomolecules."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three main Amber modules provided in the software stack?",
    "answer": "The three main modules provided are AmberTools, Amber, and Amber-PMEMD."
  },
  {
    "question": "What functionality does the AmberTools module (<code>ambertools</code>) provide?",
    "answer": "AmberTools provides tools for preparing/analyzing simulations, <code>QUICK</code> for GPU-accelerated DFT calculations, and <code>sander</code> for molecular dynamics. It is free and open source."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is included in the Amber module (<code>amber</code>)?",
    "answer": "The Amber module includes everything from AmberTools, plus the advanced <code>pmemd</code> program for high-performance molecular dynamics simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Amber-PMEMD (<code>amber-pmemd</code>) and for which Amber versions is it primarily designed?",
    "answer": "Amber-PMEMD is a high-performance MD engine <code>pmemd</code>, optimized for CPU and GPU, available as a standalone module for Amber 24+."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why was the <code>pmemd</code> program made a standalone module starting with Amber 24?",
    "answer": "Starting with Amber 24, <code>pmemd</code> no longer requires AmberTools for compilation, so it was provided as a standalone module."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the <code>amber-pmemd</code> module automatically include AmberTools?",
    "answer": "No, the <code>amber-pmemd</code> module does not include AmberTools; to use both, the <code>ambertools</code> module must be loaded separately."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users check installed versions of modules and their dependencies?",
    "answer": "Users can use the <code>module spider</code> command or check the [[Available software]] page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are older AMBER modules compatible with NVIDIA H100 GPUs?",
    "answer": "No, older AMBER modules are incompatible with NVIDIA H100 GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which specific AMBER modules are recommended for GPU-accelerated runs on H100 GPU Clusters?",
    "answer": "For GPU-accelerated runs on H100 GPU Clusters, users should use <code>ambertools/25.0</code> or <code>amber-pmemd/24.3</code>."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specialized components do the H100-compatible AMBER modules (`ambertools/25.0` or `amber-pmemd/24.3`) include?",
    "answer": "These modules include H100-specific CUDA kernels, compiled with CUDA 12+ for the Hopper architecture."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if legacy AMBER modules are used for GPU jobs on H100 nodes?",
    "answer": "Legacy AMBER modules will fail on H100 nodes if used for GPU jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are required to run <code>amber-pmemd/24.3</code> on CPUs under <code>StdEnv/2023</code>?",
