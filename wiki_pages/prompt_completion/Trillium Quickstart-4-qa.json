  {
    "question": "Where must job output be written on Trillium?",
    "answer": "Job output must be written to the scratch file system on Trillium."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are home and project directories only read-only on Trillium's compute nodes?",
    "answer": "This enforcement is to ensure that job output is written to the fast parallel scratch file system."
  },
  {
    "question": "From which directory should users typically submit their jobs on Trillium?",
    "answer": "Users should typically submit their jobs from their `$SCRATCH` directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default behavior for SLURM output files if a job is not submitted from the scratch directory?",
    "answer": "If a job is not submitted from the scratch directory, the default location for SLURM output files would not be in scratch, and thus the output files would not be written."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do jobs typically run regarding scheduler accounts on Trillium?",
    "answer": "Jobs will run under your group's RAC allocation, or if one is not available, under a RAS allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user explicitly specify the SLURM account for a job?",
    "answer": "A user can explicitly specify the account using the `--account=ACCOUNT_NAME` option in their job script or submission command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it recommended for users with multiple allocations to specify the account name?",
    "answer": "It is highly recommended for users with multiple allocations to specify the account name to explicitly control which SLURM account their job uses."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to submit new jobs from compute nodes or datamover nodes on Trillium?",
    "answer": "No, jobs cannot be submitted from compute nodes (nor datamover nodes) on Trillium."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is job submission from compute nodes prevented on Trillium?",
    "answer": "This prevents accidentally spawning many jobs, overloading the scheduler, and overloading the backup process."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can users request a specific number of cores for CPU jobs on Trillium?",
    "answer": "No, it is not possible to request a certain number of cores on Trillium; all CPU jobs must use full nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum number of cores a CPU job has at its disposal on Trillium?",
    "answer": "The minimum size of a CPU job has 192 cores at its disposal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should users do if they are running serial or low-core-count CPU jobs on Trillium?",
    "answer": "If running serial or low-core-count jobs, users must still use all 192 cores on the node by bundling multiple independent tasks in one job script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a CPU job underutilizes its allocated cores on Trillium?",
    "answer": "If a CPU job underutilizes the cores, the support team may reach out to assist in optimizing the workflow, or users can contact them for assistance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many GPUs does each node on the GPU subcluster contain?",
    "answer": "Each node on the GPU subcluster contains 4 GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What GPU request options are allowed by the scheduler on Trillium's GPU subcluster?",
    "answer": "The scheduler allows you to request either a whole number of nodes or a single GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does Trillium support requesting 2 or 3 GPUs per node, or NVIDIA's MIG technology?",
    "answer": "No, Trillium does not support requesting 2 or 3 GPUs per node, nor does it support NVIDIA's MIG technology."
  },
  {
    "question": "What technology can be used within a Trillium job to share a GPU among processes?",
    "answer": "Users can use Hyper-Q / MPS (Multi-Process Service) within their jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are memory requests in job scripts considered on Trillium?",
    "answer": "No, memory requests are ignored on Trillium."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much RAM do CPU jobs receive on Trillium?",
    "answer": "CPU jobs always receive `N \u00d7 768GB` of RAM, where `N` is the number of nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much RAM do full-node GPU jobs receive on Trillium?",
    "answer": "GPU full-node jobs receive `N \u00d7 768GB` of RAM, where `N` is the number of nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much RAM do single-GPU jobs receive on Trillium?",
    "answer": "Single-GPU jobs receive 1/4 of the node's memory, which is 188GiB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `--nodes` or `-N` option in a SLURM job script?",
    "answer": "The `--nodes` or `-N` option specifies the number of nodes requested for the job."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which option is generally preferred for launching tasks per node, `--ntasks-per-node` or `--ntasks`?",
    "answer": "`--ntasks-per-node` is preferred over `--ntasks`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `--cpus-per-task` or `-c` option typically specify?",
    "answer": "It typically specifies the number of cores per task, often for OpenMP threads."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the `--time` or `-t` option in a job script?",
    "answer": "It specifies the duration of the job."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user assign a name to their job in a SLURM script?",
    "answer": "A user can assign a name to their job using the `--job-name` or `-J` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can standard output be redirected to a file using a SLURM option?",
    "answer": "Standard output can be redirected to a file using the `--output` or `-o` option, which can also use patterns like `%j` for the job ID."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `--mail-type` option control in a SLURM job script?",
    "answer": "The `--mail-type` option controls when email notifications are sent, with options like BEGIN, END, FAIL, or ALL."
  },
  {
    "question": "What values are allowed for the `--gpus-per-node` option on Trillium's GPU subcluster?",
    "answer": "Either 1 or 4 is allowed for the `--gpus-per-node` option on the GPU subcluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `--partition` or `-p` option in a SLURM job script?",
    "answer": "The `--partition` or `-p` option specifies the partition to submit the job to."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the `--mem` option is included in a Trillium job script?",
    "answer": "The `--mem` option is ignored on Trillium, as jobs automatically receive all available memory per node or GPU fraction."
