  {
    "question": "What is Gaussian?",
    "answer": "Gaussian is a computational chemistry application produced by Gaussian, Inc."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which national systems is Gaussian currently supported?",
    "answer": "Gaussian is currently supported on Nibi and Fir."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of Gaussian parallel execution is not supported on national systems?",
    "answer": "Cluster/network parallel execution, also known as \"Linda parallelism\", is not supported."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of Gaussian parallel execution is supported?",
    "answer": "Only \"shared-memory multiprocessor parallel execution\" is supported."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum number of compute nodes a Gaussian job can use?",
    "answer": "No Gaussian job can use more than a single compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the conditions for using Gaussian software?",
    "answer": "Users must agree not to be a member of a research group developing competitive software, not to copy or distribute the software, to properly acknowledge Gaussian Inc. and the Alliance in publications, and to notify the Alliance of any acknowledgment changes. Sponsored users' PIs must also file a similar statement."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I gain access to Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You must contact support with a copy of the required statement, and access will then be granted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check the available Gaussian versions on Nibi and Fir?",
    "answer": "You can check available versions by using the `module spider gaussian` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which job scheduler is used on the national clusters for Gaussian jobs?",
    "answer": "The national clusters use the Slurm scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended maximum number of CPUs for a Gaussian job?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to use no more than 32 CPUs per job unless there is good evidence that they can be used efficiently, due to the scalability of Gaussian."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPUs do the new Nibi and Fir clusters have per node?",
    "answer": "The new clusters Nibi and Fir have 192 CPUs per node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should users avoid running full-node Gaussian jobs on Nibi and Fir?",
    "answer": "Running full-node Gaussian jobs on these clusters will be inefficient due to Gaussian's scalability limitations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What files are required for submitting a Gaussian job?",
    "answer": "An input file (e.g., \"name.com\") and a job script to define compute resources are required; both must be in the same directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main options for running Gaussian jobs on the clusters?",
    "answer": "The two options are G16 (G09, G03) and g16 (g09, g03), which differ based on the location of default runtime files and job size."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does the G16 (G09, G03) option save default runtime files?",
    "answer": "This option saves default runtime files (unnamed .rwf, .inp, .d2e, .int, .skr files) to `/scratch/username/jobid/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an advantage of using the G16 (G09, G03) option for runtime files?",
    "answer": "The files will stay in `/scratch/username/jobid/` even if the job is unfinished or failed, allowing the .rwf file to be located for restart purposes later."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the G16 module in a job script?",
    "answer": "You load the G16 module using the command `module load gaussian/g16.c01`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you execute a G16 job within a job script using the G16 option?",
    "answer": "You execute a G16 job using the command `G16 name.com`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you use Gaussian 09 or Gaussian 03 instead of G16 in a job script?",
    "answer": "To use Gaussian 09 or 03, modify `module load gaussian/g16.c01` to `gaussian/g09.e01` or `gaussian/g03.d01`, and change the command `G16` to `G09` or `G03` respectively."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does the g16 (g09, g03) option save default runtime files?",
    "answer": "This option saves default runtime files temporarily in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` (`/localscratch/username.jobid.0/`) on the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to runtime files saved by the g16 (g09, g03) option after a job finishes?",
    "answer": "The files will be removed by the scheduler when the job is done, regardless of whether it was successful or not."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should you use the g16 (g09, g03) option?",
    "answer": "You can use this option if you do not expect to use the .rwf file to restart at a later time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the capacity of /localscratch and when should the G16 option be used over g16 for job files?",
    "answer": "/localscratch is approximately 800GB and is shared by all jobs on the same node. If your job files would be bigger than or close to that size range, you should use the G16 (G09, G03) option instead."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you execute a g16 job within a job script using the g16 option?",
    "answer": "You execute a g16 job using the command `g16 < name.com >& name.log`."
