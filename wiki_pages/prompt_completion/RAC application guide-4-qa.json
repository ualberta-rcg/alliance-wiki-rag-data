    "question": "What resources should be requested in a RAC application if a project needs 500 core-years, 20 TB of project storage, and 80 TB of nearline storage on Narval?",
    "answer": "Only 500 core-years should be requested, as the storage needs can be met with what is available via RAS."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a project requires 100 core-years and 10 TB of project storage on Trillium, plus 50 TB of nearline storage on HPSS, what should be included in the RAC application?",
    "answer": "You should only request the 10 TB of project storage on Trillium and 50 TB of nearline storage on HPSS, as the CPU needs might be met without a RAC allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What resources must be requested in a RAC application if a project needs 400 core-years, 30 RGU-years, and 200 TB of project storage on Nibi?",
    "answer": "All these resources (400 core-years, 30 RGU-years, and 200 TB of project storage) must be requested in the RAC application as they are all above the minimum eligible amounts."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should a RAC application request 150 core-years on Rorqual if it has different memory requirements, such as 100 cores with 16 GB per core and 50 cores with 4 GB per core?",
    "answer": "You should make two separate CPU requests on Rorqual to account for the different memory requirements, or average out the total memory per core and make one request for 150 cores with 12 GB per core, provided the total core-equivalent-years needed on a single cluster is greater than the minimum."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is a request for 45 TB of project storage, split as 20 TB on Rorqual and 25 TB on Narval, eligible for a RAC application?",
    "answer": "Yes, this request is eligible because the total amount of project storage needed (45 TB) exceeds the 41 TB minimum."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a project needs a total of 100 TB of storage, split as 50 TB of project storage and 50 TB of nearline on Fir, is this request eligible for RAC?",
    "answer": "Yes, this request is eligible because even though the nearline amount is below its minimum (101 TB), the project storage request (50 TB) is eligible. Both requests should be included in the application."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be requested in a RAC application if a project needs 100 VCPU of compute cloud resources on Arbutus, along with 5 TB of Volume and snapshot storage and 5 TB of object storage?",
    "answer": "All these resources should be requested in the online form. The storage resources must be included even if they are less than 11 TB, because the VCPUs needed on Arbutus exceed the minimum required to apply."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why would a RAC application requesting 250 core-years in total, split as 100 cores on Fir and 150 cores on Nibi, be rejected?",
    "answer": "This request will be rejected because each cluster's CPU request (100 cores on Fir and 150 cores on Nibi) is below the minimum 200 core-years required per cluster, and the CPU needs may be met without a RAC allocation. An application only including CPU in this way will be disqualified."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will a RAC application be accepted if it requests 20 reference GPU units in total, split between Narval and Rorqual with 10 RGU each?",
    "answer": "No, this request will not be accepted because the GPU request for each cluster (10 RGU) is below the minimum eligible amount of 25 RGU-years per cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should a project not apply for RAC if it needs 25 VCPU of persistent cloud resources on Arbutus with 10 TB of Volume and snapshot storage?",
    "answer": "Such a project should not apply for RAC as these resources are available via RAS (Rapid Access Service), indicating they are below the minimums for RAC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the requirement for using application templates in the RAC process?",
    "answer": "Applicants are required to use the latest version of the template provided for their corresponding application process, as instructions may change annually."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum page limit for RAC applications, excluding references?",
    "answer": "Applications exceeding 10 pages (before References) will not be accepted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should references be submitted with a RAC application?",
    "answer": "References must be submitted as a separate document, unless the total number of pages of the entire application, including references, is 10 pages or less, in which case everything can be submitted in one document."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what file format must RAC application documents be submitted?",
    "answer": "RAC application documents must be submitted in PDF format."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the English Word or OpenDocument template for Resources for Research Groups (RRG) applications?",
    "answer": "The English Word or OpenDocument template for RRG applications can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JsOQ1DVsGaM3DOrn49MSCTEFKw_gvJ8x3cJ1JmYb6h4/edit?tab=t.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you download an editable template from the provided Google document links?",
    "answer": "From the non-editable Google document, go to `File \u2192 Download` in the main menu and select `Microsoft Word` or `OpenDocument Format` to download and save the template."
