  {
    "question": "What do the Slurm messages \"Nodes required for job are DOWN, DRAINED or RESERVED for jobs in higher priority partitions\" or \"ReqNodeNotAvailable\" mean?",
    "answer": "These messages indicate that one or more nodes Slurm considered for the job are either down, deliberately taken offline, or reserved for other jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of Slurm introduced the messages \"Nodes required for job are DOWN, DRAINED or RESERVED...\" or \"ReqNodeNotAvailable\"?",
    "answer": "These messages are new to Slurm version 19.05."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are \"Nodes required for job are DOWN, DRAINED or RESERVED...\" or \"ReqNodeNotAvailable\" considered error messages?",
    "answer": "No, these are not error messages; jobs submitted are actually in the queue and will eventually be processed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the equivalent reason message for \"Nodes required for job are DOWN, DRAINED or RESERVED...\" in Slurm version 17.11?",
    "answer": "The messages mean effectively the same thing as the reason \"Resources\" that appeared in Slurm version 17.11."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the `START_TIME` displayed by default in `squeue` output?",
    "answer": "No, the start time is not shown by default with `squeue`, but it can be printed with an option."
  },
  {
    "question": "How accurate are Slurm's forecasted `START_TIME` values for pending jobs?",
    "answer": "The start times Slurm forecasts depend on rapidly changing conditions and are therefore not very useful."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information does Slurm use to compute `START_TIME` for high-priority pending jobs?",
    "answer": "Slurm computes `START_TIME` from currently available information, including what resources will be freed by running jobs that complete and what resources will be needed by other, higher-priority jobs waiting to run."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can cause Slurm to invalidate its future plans for job start times?",
    "answer": "Slurm invalidates future plans if jobs end early, changing which resources become available, or if prioritization changes due to submission of higher-priority jobs or cancellation of queued jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does Slurm frequently discard and recompute its future plans on general-purpose clusters?",
    "answer": "On general purpose clusters, new jobs are submitted about every five seconds, and 30-50% of jobs end early, causing Slurm to often discard and recompute its future plans."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does \"N/A\" mean in the `START_TIME` column of `squeue` output?",
    "answer": "\"N/A\" stands for \"not available,\" meaning Slurm is not attempting to project a start time for those jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How accurate is the `START_TIME` for jobs that are already running?",
    "answer": "For jobs which are already running, the start time reported by `squeue` is perfectly accurate."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are .core files?",
    "answer": "A .core file is a binary file left behind when a program crashes or exits abnormally, containing a snapshot of the program's state at the moment it crashed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are .core files useful for regular users?",
    "answer": ".core files are normally of no interest for regular users beyond indicating that something went wrong with the execution of the software."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user prevent .core files from being created?",
    "answer": "Users can add the line `ulimit -c 0` to the end of their `$HOME/.bashrc` file to ensure that .core files are no longer created."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example of a \"library not found\" error when installing precompiled binary packages?",
    "answer": "An example is `/lib64/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.18' not found` at runtime."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find instructions to fix \"library not found\" errors when installing binary packages in their `$HOME` directory?",
    "answer": "Users can find instructions in the \"Installing binary packages\" section under [[Installing_software_in_your_home_directory#Installing_binary_packages|Installing binary packages]]."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the Alliance provide clusters specifically for handling sensitive research data?",
    "answer": "No, the Alliance does not operate any cluster specifically designated for handling personal, private, or sensitive data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are Alliance resources certified for specific security assurance levels required for certain sensitive datasets?",
    "answer": "No, none of the Alliance resources are certified as meeting specific security assurance levels that may be required for certain datasets."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is ultimately responsible for data protection and privacy when using Alliance resources for research?",
    "answer": "Responsibility for data protection and data privacy rests ultimately with the researcher."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can researchers find more information on data protection, privacy, and confidentiality policies?",
    "answer": "Researchers can find more information in Privacy and Data Protection Policy section 5.2, Terms of Use paragraph 3.12 at their Agreements page, or by seeing [[Data protection, privacy, and confidentiality]]."
