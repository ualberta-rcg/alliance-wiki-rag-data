  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the TRF (Tandem Repeats Finder) program?",
    "answer": "TRF (Tandem Repeats Finder) is a program designed to locate and display tandem repeats in DNA sequences."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of input does Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF) accept?",
    "answer": "TRF accepts DNA sequences in FASTA format as input."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does TRF require users to specify repeat patterns or sizes?",
    "answer": "No, TRF does not require users to specify the pattern, size of the pattern, or any other parameter for detecting tandem repeats."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the output files generated by TRF?",
    "answer": "The output of TRF consists of two files: a repeat table file and an alignment file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users view detailed information about repeats found by TRF?",
    "answer": "The repeat table, which is viewable in a web browser, contains information about each repeat. Clicking on the location indices for a table entry opens a second browser page showing an alignment of the copies against a consensus pattern."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the performance of TRF for sequence analysis?",
    "answer": "TRF is very fast; it can analyze sequences on the order of 0.5 Mb in just a few seconds."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the supported range for repeat pattern sizes in TRF?",
    "answer": "TRF can detect repeats with pattern sizes ranging from 1 to 2000 bases."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Trilinos?",
    "answer": "Trilinos is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling technologies within an object-oriented software framework for solving large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and scientific problems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a unique design feature of the Trilinos Project?",
    "answer": "A unique design feature of Trilinos is its focus on packages."
  },

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of trimAl?",
    "answer": "trimAl is a tool designed for the automated removal of spurious sequences or poorly aligned regions from a multiple sequence alignment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Trimmomatic used for?",
    "answer": "Trimmomatic performs a variety of useful trimming tasks for Illumina paired-end and single-ended data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are trimming steps and parameters supplied to Trimmomatic?",
    "answer": "The selection of trimming steps and their associated parameters are supplied to Trimmomatic on the command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Trinity's primary function in bioinformatics?",
    "answer": "Trinity is a novel method for the efficient and robust de novo reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-Seq data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three independent software modules combined in Trinity?",
    "answer": "Trinity combines three independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis, and Butterfly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Trinotate?",
    "answer": "Trinotate is a comprehensive annotation suite designed for automatic functional annotation of transcriptomes, especially de novo assembled transcriptomes, from model or non-model organisms."
