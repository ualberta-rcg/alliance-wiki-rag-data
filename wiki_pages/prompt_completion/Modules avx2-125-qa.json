    "question": "What input format does tRNAscan-SE accept?",
    "answer": "tRNAscan-SE accepts DNA or RNA sequences in FASTA format."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the output formats for tRNA predictions in tRNAscan-SE?",
    "answer": "tRNA predictions from tRNAscan-SE are output in standard tabular or ACeDB format."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does tRNAscan-SE perform tRNA detection itself?",
    "answer": "No, tRNAscan-SE does not perform tRNA detection itself; instead, it combines the strengths of three independent tRNA prediction programs."
