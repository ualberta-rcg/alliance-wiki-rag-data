    "answer": "Large files named `core.12345` are probably core dump files, which can be deleted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do data transfer applications generally handle one large file versus many small files?",
    "answer": "Most data transfer applications move a single large file more efficiently than several small files whose total size would be equivalent."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if my directories contain a large number of small files?",
    "answer": "If your directories or file trees include a large number of small files, combine them for archiving using tar."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might it be beneficial to compress large files before transfer?",
    "answer": "It can be advantageous to compress large files, especially text files, whose size is often considerably reduced by compression."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does compressing a file always result in a significant time gain during transfer?",
    "answer": "No, there isn't always a significant time gain by compressing a file that will be decompressed upon arrival."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors should be considered when deciding whether to compress files for transfer?",
    "answer": "You should consider the space gained by file compression, the duration of the compression time, and the availability of bandwidth."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which tools can be used for compression if it is deemed advantageous?",
    "answer": "If you estimate that compression is advantageous, you can use tar or gzip."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I avoid when transferring files to a new system regarding identical data?",
    "answer": "Avoid transferring multiple files containing identical data to a new system."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I prevent different data from being overwritten if files have the same name?",
