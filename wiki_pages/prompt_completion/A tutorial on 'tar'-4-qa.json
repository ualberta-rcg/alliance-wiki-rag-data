  {
    "question": "What are the basic `tar` options used to extract an archive?",
    "answer": "To extract an archive, you use the `-x` (for extract) option with `-f` (for file). The `-v` option can also be added for verbosity."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a `tar` archive to a specific destination directory?",
    "answer": "You can extract a `tar` archive to a different destination directory by adding the `-C` option followed by the directory name, for example: `tar -xvf results.tar -C new_results/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a prerequisite for using the `-C` option to specify a destination directory for `tar`?",
    "answer": "The destination directory specified with the `-C` option must already exist before you run the `tar` command, otherwise `tar` will fail."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if you extract a `tar` archive into a directory that already exists and contains files with the same names?",
    "answer": "If a directory of that name exists and contains files of the same names as in the archive, they will be overwritten upon extraction."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `-v` option display when extracting a `tar` archive?",
    "answer": "The `-v` option displays only the file names as they are extracted from the archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view more detailed information, such as permissions and dates, when extracting a `tar` archive?",
    "answer": "To see more details (like date, permission), you should invoke the `-v` option twice, using `-xvvf` instead of `-xvf`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you decompress a file with a `.gz` extension?",
    "answer": "For files with a `.gz` extension, use the `gunzip` command, for example: `gunzip new.log.dat.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you decompress a file with a `.bz2` extension?",
    "answer": "For files with a `.bz2` extension, use the `bunzip2` command, for example: `bunzip2 new.log.dat.bz2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a `.tar.gz` archive to a specified directory in a single step?",
    "answer": "You can extract a `.tar.gz` archive into another directory in one step using the command: `tar -xvzf your_archive.tar.gz -C destination_dir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a `.tar.bz2` archive to a specified directory in a single step?",
    "answer": "You can extract a `.tar.bz2` archive into another directory in one step using the command: `tar -xvjf your_archive.tar.bz2 -C destination_dir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the destination directory option (`-C`) be placed at the beginning of the `tar` command when extracting compressed archives?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to start the `tar` command with the `-C` option (e.g., `tar -C new_results/ -xzf results.tar.gz`), but you must ensure that the destination directory exists beforehand as `tar` will not create it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are files extracted if the `-C` option is not used when extracting an archive?",
    "answer": "If the `-C` (destination directory) option is not invoked, the files will be extracted into the same directory where the command is run."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a `.tar.bz2` archive in two separate steps?",
    "answer": "First, decompress the file using `bunzip2 your_archive.tar.bz2`, then extract the resulting `.tar` file using `tar -C destination_dir -xvf your_archive.tar`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a `.tar.gz` archive in two separate steps?",
    "answer": "First, decompress the file using `gunzip your_archive.tar.gz`, then extract the resulting `.tar` file using `tar -C destination_dir -xvf your_archive.tar`."
