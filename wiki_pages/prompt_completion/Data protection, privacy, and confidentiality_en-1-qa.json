    "question": "Are there any resources specifically designated for handling sensitive data, such as human clinical research data?",
    "answer": "No, we don't have resources specifically designated for sensitive data at this time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the resources formally certified to meet specific security or privacy assurance levels?",
    "answer": "No resource is formally certified as meeting specific security or privacy assurance levels which may be required for certain datasets."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is data guaranteed to be encrypted at rest on these resources?",
    "answer": "No, data is not guaranteed to be encrypted at rest, as we provide shared resources, networks, nodes, and memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of data access control is offered for files and directories?",
    "answer": "We offer the standard Linux filesystem segregation and access control to files and directories."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do sysadmins have access to user data?",
    "answer": "Our sysadmins do have access to all material when necessary or when authorized by their owners."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is ultimately responsible for data protection and data privacy?",
    "answer": "Responsibility for data protection and data privacy rests ultimately with the researcher."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find policies related to data and privacy?",
    "answer": "You can find policies at [https://alliancecan.ca/en/policies our policies]."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can support staff provide guidance on handling sensitive data?",
    "answer": "Yes, support staff can give guidance on handling of sensitive data, including advice on access control, encryption, storage, and transmission."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I get assistance with handling sensitive data?",
    "answer": "Please contact [[technical support]] for assistance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the basic principle for protecting data against hardware failure?",
    "answer": "Our basic principle is to have some level of duplication for most filesystems, with the level of duplication depending on the risk."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is local storage on compute nodes duplicated?",
    "answer": "Local storage on compute nodes - where it exists - does not have any form of duplication."
  },
  {
    "question": "How reliable are scratch filesystems and do they have backups?",
    "answer": "Scratch filesystems have high reliability to protect against multiple simultaneous disk failures but do not have a backup."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are project and home filesystems protected?",
    "answer": "Project and home filesystems have high reliability to protect against multiple simultaneous disk failures, and also have periodic backup copies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does Nearline storage provide for data protection?",
    "answer": "Nearline storage provides copies of data on tape."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two primary ways unauthorized access to data could happen?",
    "answer": "Unauthorized access to data could happen through hardware and software."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is unauthorized access through hardware prevented?",
    "answer": "Only approved personnel can physically access the infrastructure, and removed storage devices are either destroyed, encrypted, or erased."
  },
  {
    "question": "What measures are taken with storage devices removed due to hardware failure?",
    "answer": "Storage devices which are removed due to hardware failure are either destroyed or already encrypted or erased before being returned to the vendor for replacement."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is unauthorized access through software prevented on clusters?",
    "answer": "All clusters use standard POSIX and ACL permissions on their filesystems, with monitoring for CVEs, applying patches, and detecting anomalous behavior."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is responsible for ensuring a file has the desired group and appropriate permissions?",
    "answer": "Ultimately, the owner of a file is responsible for ensuring that it belongs to the desired group and has the appropriate permissions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is done to protect against privilege escalation (hacks)?",
    "answer": "Our team monitors for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE mailing lists), applies patches, monitors systems for anomalous behaviour, and privileged accounts have stricter security requirements."
  },
  {
    "question": "Despite precautions, is unauthorized access still a possibility?",
    "answer": "Yes, while precautions are taken to minimize the risk of unauthorized access, such a possibility does exist because the clusters remain shared infrastructure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a researcher do if their data requires an additional level of protection?",
    "answer": "If your data requires an additional level of protection, you should consider encrypting it using a tool like GNU Privacy Guard (gpg), which is installed on our clusters."
