  {
    "question": "How often is the `dt_cutoff` value recomputed in the META package?",
    "answer": "The `dt_cutoff` value is recomputed at every subsequent power of two number of computed cases (e.g., 8, 16, 32, and so on) to improve its accuracy."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the average reduction in wasted CPU cycles due to the runtime estimation algorithm?",
    "answer": "The algorithm reduces the amount of CPU cycles wasted due to jobs hitting the run-time limit by a factor of 8, on average."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are the individual run-times for all cases stored after running a farm?",
    "answer": "Individual run-times for all cases are stored in the `/home/$USER/tmp/$NODE.$PID/times` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the `times` file, which contains individual case run-times, be utilized?",
    "answer": "The `times` file can be analyzed to fine-tune your farm setup or for profiling your code."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the error message \"Non-farm directory, or no farm has been submitted; exiting\" indicate?",
    "answer": "This message indicates that the current directory is not a farm directory, or the `submit.run` command has never been executed for this farm."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should you correct the error \"Wrong first argument: XXX (should be a positive integer or -1) ; exiting\"?",
    "answer": "To correct this error, you must use the correct first argument: `-1` for SIMPLE mode, or a positive integer `N` (number of requested meta-jobs) for META mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `lockfile` utility in the META package?",
    "answer": "The `lockfile` utility is critical for providing serialized access of meta-jobs to the `table.dat` file, ensuring that two different meta-jobs do not read the same line simultaneously."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps should be taken if you encounter the error \"lockfile is not on path; exiting\"?",
    "answer": "You should ensure that the `lockfile` utility is included in your `$PATH` environment variable."
  },
  {
    "question": "What could be missing if you see the error \"Non-farm directory (config.h, job_script.sh, single_case.sh, and/or table.dat are missing); exiting\"?",
    "answer": "This error means the current directory is not a farm directory, or important files like `config.h`, `job_script.sh`, `single_case.sh`, or `table.dat` are missing. You should change to the correct farm directory or create the missing files."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why would the system exit with the message \"-auto option requires resubmit_script.sh file in the root farm directory; exiting\"?",
    "answer": "This error occurs if you used the `-auto` option but forgot to create the `resubmit_script.sh` file inside the root farm directory. A sample file is automatically copied there when `farm_init.run` is executed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the error \"File table.dat doesn't exist. Exiting\"?",
    "answer": "This error occurs if `table.dat` is not present in the current directory, or if you are running `submit.run` from outside one of your farm sub-directories."
  },
  {
    "question": "What crucial `sbatch` argument must be present in `job_script.sh` for all meta-jobs?",
    "answer": "You must provide a run-time limit for all meta-jobs as an `#SBATCH` argument (e.g., `-t` or `--time`) inside your `job_script.sh` file, as it cannot be passed as an optional argument to `submit.run`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the error \"Wrong job runtime in job_script.sh - nnn . Exiting\" imply?",
    "answer": "This error implies that the run-time argument within your `job_script.sh` file is not properly formatted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What action should be taken if `sbatch` submission fails with messages like \"Something wrong with sbatch farm submission; jobid=XXX; aborting\" or \"Something wrong with a auto-resubmit job submission; jobid=XXX; aborting\"?",
    "answer": "These messages indicate an issue with submitting jobs via `sbatch`, possibly due to a misbehaving or busy cluster scheduler. You should try again a bit later."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the errors \"Couldn't create subdirectories inside the farm directory ; exiting\", \"Couldn't create the temp directory XXX ; exiting\", or \"Couldn't create a file inside XXX ; exiting\" signify?",
    "answer": "These three messages point to a problem with the file system, such as incorrect permissions or an exhausted quota, which needs to be resolved before proceeding."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what condition can `resubmit.run` be used?",
    "answer": "`resubmit.run` can only be used after all meta-jobs from the farm have finished running. You can check the farm's status using `list.run` or `queue.run`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the message \"No failed/unfinished jobs; nothing to resubmit\" mean?",
    "answer": "This message means that your farm was 100% processed and there are no remaining failed or never-run cases to compute."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the message \"Too many failed (very short) cases - exiting\"?",
    "answer": "This message appears if the first `$N_failed_max` cases are very short, meaning they last less than `$dt_failed` seconds in duration, indicating they failed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you resolve the \"Too many failed (very short) cases - exiting\" error?",
    "answer": "You need to determine and fix the reasons for the cases failing, or adjust the `$N_failed_max` and `$dt_failed` values in your `config.h` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What could be the reason for the error \"lockfile is not on path on node XXX\"?",
    "answer": "This error suggests that the `lockfile` utility is not in your `$PATH` on a specific compute node, possibly because a file system failed to mount correctly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is \"Exiting after processing one case (-1 option)\" considered an error message?",
    "answer": "No, this is not an error message; it simply indicates that the farm was submitted with `submit.run -1` (one case per job mode), causing each meta-job to exit after processing a single case."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the message \"Not enough runtime left; exiting.\" signify?",
    "answer": "This message indicates that a meta-job is exiting early because it has determined, based on the run-times of processed cases, that it likely does not have enough time left to complete the next case before hitting its run-time limit."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is \"No cases left; exiting.\" an error message?",
    "answer": "No, this is not an error message; it is how each meta-job normally finishes when all cases have been successfully computed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if the message \"Only failed cases left; cannot auto-resubmit; exiting\" appears?",
    "answer": "This message only occurs if the `-auto` switch was used when submitting the farm and only failed cases remain. You should find the failed cases using `Status.run -f`, fix the underlying issues, and then run `resubmit.run`."
