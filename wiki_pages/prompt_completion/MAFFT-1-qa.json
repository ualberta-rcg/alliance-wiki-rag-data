  {
    "question": "What SLURM resources are requested in the example `mafft_submit.sh` script for a single node job?",
    "answer": "The example `mafft_submit.sh` script requests 24 hours of time, 1 node, 32 cpus-per-task, and 0 memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules should be loaded for a single node MAFFT job according to the provided example?",
    "answer": "The `gcc/9.3.0` and `mafft` modules should be loaded."

  {
    "question": "What is the command used to run MAFFT in the single node example script?",
    "answer": "The command used is `mafft --globalpair --thread $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK input > output`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can MAFFT be used to align a large number of sequences across multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "MAFFT can use MPI (Message Passing Interface) to align a large number of sequences across multiple nodes."

  {
    "question": "What is the default value for the MAFFT_TMPDIR environment variable when the MAFFT module is loaded for multiple nodes (MPI) usage?",
    "answer": "For multiple nodes (MPI) usage, MAFFT_TMPDIR is set to `$SCRATCH/maffttmp` when the module is loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the requirement if the temporary directory (MAFFT_TMPDIR) is changed for a multi-node MAFFT MPI job?",
    "answer": "If the temporary directory is changed for a multi-node MAFFT MPI job, it must be shared by all hosts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What SLURM resources are requested in the example `mafft_mpi_submit.sh` script for a multiple node job?",
    "answer": "The example `mafft_mpi_submit.sh` script requests 4 hours of time, 2 nodes, 4 tasks per node, 1 cpu per task, and 12GB of memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules should be loaded for a multiple node MAFFT MPI job according to the provided example?",
    "answer": "The `gcc/9.3.0` and `mafft-mpi` modules should be loaded."
