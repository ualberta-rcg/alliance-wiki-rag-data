    "question": "What should I do if I need less than the minimum amount of resources allowed to submit an RRG application?",
    "answer": "If you require resources that are less than the minimum amount required to apply for the RAC, you do not need to submit an application. Instead, you should make use of the Rapid Access Service (RAS), which allows PIs and their research groups to access modest quantities of storage and cloud resources after they register for an account. Opportunistic access to compute resources is also possible through RAS, but priority is only given to those with an allocation. Many research groups can meet their needs through RAS only."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a researcher submit more than one application through the RRG?",
    "answer": "No. While Principal investigators (PIs) can participate as collaborators on other projects submitting RRG proposals, they can only be the lead applicant for one RRG application."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to apply to the RRG again this year even if I received an RRG allocation last year?",
    "answer": "If you are eligible to Fast Track, you can either accept the invitation to Fast Track or decline and submit a new RRG application. You should accept the invitation to Fast Track if your needs for resources will remain the same, knowing that all allocations are still subject to scaling based on supply and demand and on the amount of resources requested in your previous RRG full application. If you need more resources than what you currently have allocated (especially compute or cloud), then you should submit a new application."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is every application to the RAC accepted?",
    "answer": "No. Due to the imbalance of demand versus available resources, the RAC has increasingly become a more competitive process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the RAC applications evaluated?",
    "answer": "The evaluation criteria for both the RRG and RPP application processes are available in the [[RAC application guide]]. We strongly encourage applicants to read it carefully."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Resource Platforms and Portals (RPP) application process and how is it different from the Resources for Research Groups process?",
    "answer": "The RPP is a peer-reviewed application process for projects whose '''primary purpose''' is to provide a service through ''scientific gateways'' that improve access to shared datasets, enhance existing online research tools and facilities, or advance national or international research collaborations. The RRG is a peer-reviewed application process for projects whose '''primary purpose''' is to conduct research requiring compute, storage and cloud resources to meet their goals. Projects ''primarily'' needing compute resources in a cluster to conduct research should apply through the RRG process instead."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should apply through the RPP process?",
    "answer": "Projects applying through the RPP must: Provide resources to a larger research community via a set of cloud-based tools, applications and/or data, thus enabling them to access national resources via a common interface. Be able to develop, operate and manage the proposed portal or platform with minimal support from Alliance Federation staff. Generally, an RPP project will involve cloud resources, usually through the development of a front-end gateway on persistent virtual machines, with possible backend compute either through cloud compute nodes or job-based submission to the large national clusters. Additionally, many platforms and portals include large databases. Applicants for RPPs are expected to have sufficient experience within their team to develop, manage and operate their platform or portal. We provide support to RPP teams on a best-effort basis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can researchers submit more than one RPP application?",
    "answer": "Yes. An Academic PI may: apply as a lead submitter for only one RRG application (either through the full application process or the Fast Track one) at a time but can be involved in multiple RRG submissions as a participant; and be the lead submitter for one RPP application per competition round and be involved in other RPP applications as a participant."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I receive a multi-year allocation, do I have to submit a full application every year to renew it?",
    "answer": "No. Research groups that are awarded multi-year allocations are required to submit an annual progress report; however, they do not need to submit a new application each year to renew. This annual progress report must be uploaded directly on CCDB. For more information on what is required for the RPP Progress Report, click [[RPP Annual Progress Report Guidelines|here]]."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I have a one-year RPP allocation and want to keep it for next year, do I have to submit a new application?",
    "answer": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the RPP applications evaluated?",
    "answer": "The evaluation criteria is available in the [[RAC application guide|application guide]]. We strongly encourage applicants to read it carefully."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information do I need to provide in the RPP annual progress report?",
    "answer": "Please visit the [[RPP Annual Progress Report Guidelines|RPP Annual Progress Report page]] for details."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the term 'allocation' mean?",
    "answer": "A compute allocation corresponds to a target for use over a period of time, usually a year. For storage, and for certain cloud resources, this is a '''maximum''' amount. Allocations are usually made in terms of core years, GPU years or storage space. Storage allocations are the most straightforward to understand: research groups will get a maximum amount of storage that they can use exclusively throughout the allocation period. Core year and GPU year allocations are more difficult to understand because these allocations are meant to capture average use throughout the allocation period \u2013 typically meant to be a year \u2013 and this use will occur across a set of resources shared with other research groups. To learn more about compute allocations, read the [[Allocations and compute scheduling]] documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "When will I receive my allocation(s)?",
    "answer": "Generally, all successful allocations are activated in April. The exact starting date will be confirmed in your notification letter."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is my compute allocation guaranteed?",
    "answer": "No. Use of your total allocation cannot be fully guaranteed and is contingent on the availability of our systems. You should receive the full allocation if you run in a reasonably constant manner over the year. If you expect to have an uneven workload, please contact our support team at support@tech.alliancecan.ca so that they can ensure you have access to the resources you require."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I use my total allocation and it was not sufficient for my needs, can I get access to more resources?",
    "answer": "PIs can access modest quantities of storage and cloud resources through the [[Rapid Access Service]]. Compute resources are also available for opportunistic use without priority. For compute allocations, generally speaking, we allocate our batch processing priority based on a fair-share algorithm. Each user is allocated a share of the total system resources, which effectively translates into priority access to the system. If you have used a large fraction of the system recently (i.e., larger than your fair-share), your priority drops. However, the scheduling system has a limited time window over which it calculates priority. For more information, read the Allocations and compute scheduling documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do existing RAC allocations get priority when future allocations are decided?",
    "answer": "Each annual RAC is handled as a separate application round. The current projects may have an advantage if they can demonstrate usage and success stories, but not an advantage by policy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use the resources without an allocation?",
    "answer": "Yes. Please visit the How to Access ARC Resources page for more details."
