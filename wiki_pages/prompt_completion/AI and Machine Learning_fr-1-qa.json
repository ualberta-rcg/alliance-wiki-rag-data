  {
    "question": "Why is it important to understand cluster specifics for machine learning applications?",
    "answer": "Clusters are much more complex than local computers used for prototyping, possessing distributed file systems and different performance implications, especially for paths like `/project`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key difference between local computers and clusters regarding file access?",
    "answer": "Clusters have distributed file systems, and while accessing a file in `/project` might seem similar to a local file, the performance effects under the hood are very different."
  },
  {
    "question": "What section is recommended for managing datasets on clusters?",
    "answer": "It is important to consult the section 'G\u00e9rer vos ensembles de donn\u00e9es'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does this page generally describe?",
    "answer": "This page describes best practices for using clusters and provides references to useful information."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find an autonomous training tutorial for Machine Learning offered by SHARCNET?",
    "answer": "You can find it by clicking on 'Introduction to Machine Learning' at [https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/enrol/index.php?id=180]."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a tutorial available if my machine learning program is ready to run on the clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can refer to 'notre tutoriel' (our tutorial) named 'Tutoriel Apprentissage machine'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a user-prepared tutorial for configuring a Python environment for Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, a user-prepared tutorial is available at [https://prashp.gitlab.io/post/compute-canada-tut/] which describes steps for configuring Python environments with the Alliance."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Python a popular software for machine learning?",
    "answer": "Yes, Python is a popular software in machine learning."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find important information about Python versions, virtual environments, and other related topics?",
    "answer": "You can find this information on the [[Python/fr|Python wiki page]]."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended to avoid problems caused by Anaconda?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to use `virtualenv` to avoid problems caused by Anaconda."
  },
  {
    "question": "How easy is it to switch from Anaconda to `virtualenv`?",
    "answer": "In most cases, it is easy to switch to `virtualenv`; you just need to install the same packages, excluding CUDA, CuDNN, and other low-level libraries already on the clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find information on installation and frequent problems for machine learning software packages?",
    "answer": "You can find this information on the wiki page for each specific package."
  },
  {
    "question": "Name some of the available machine learning software packages for which information is provided.",
    "answer": "Some available packages include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Torch, SpaCy, XGBoost, Scikit-Learn, and SnapML."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of storage solutions are offered for research needs?",
    "answer": "Various solutions are offered, ranging from high-speed local temporary storage to long-term storage on different media."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more information about storage and file management?",
    "answer": "More information can be found on the [[Storage and file management/fr|Stockage et gestion de fichiers]] page."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommendation for machine learning tasks if the dataset is 10GB or less?",
    "answer": "If the dataset is 10GB or less, it likely fits into memory, and machine learning tasks should not read data from disk."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if a dataset is around 100GB or less?",
    "answer": "If the dataset is around 100GB or less, it should be transferred to the local storage space of the compute node at the beginning of the task, as it is faster and more reliable than shared spaces like `/home`, `/project`, and `/scratch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What temporary directory is available for each task on a compute node?",
    "answer": "For each task, a temporary directory is available at `$SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the potential issues with using the local storage of a compute node for datasets around 100GB?",
    "answer": "Another user's task might fully occupy the node's storage space, leaving no room, though sometimes a terabyte might be available exclusively."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should datasets larger than 100GB be stored permanently?",
    "answer": "Datasets larger than 100GB can be stored permanently in your `/project` space."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what kind of data access frequency are shared storage spaces (`/home`, `/project`, `/scratch`) designed?",
    "answer": "Shared storage spaces are designed for reading and storing data at a low frequency, such as one large block every 10 seconds rather than 10 small blocks per second."
