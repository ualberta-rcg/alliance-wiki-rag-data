    "answer": "DETONATE (DE novo TranscriptOme rNa-seq Assembly with or without the Truth Evaluation) is mainly intended for evaluating de novo transcriptome assemblies, and its REF-EVAL component can be used to compare sets of any kinds of genomic sequences."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main packages included in DETONATE?",
    "answer": "DETONATE consists of two component packages: RSEM-EVAL and REF-EVAL."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is DFTB+ and what is its advantage?",
    "answer": "DFTB+ is a fast, efficient, and versatile quantum mechanical simulation package based on the Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) method. It can perform quantum mechanical simulations approximately two orders of magnitude faster than ab-initio density functional theory based packages."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of DFTB+ are provided?",
    "answer": "DFTB+ is provided in versions 21.1, 21.2, and 24.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any compatible modules or extensions for DFTB+?",
    "answer": "Yes, DFTB+ is compatible with python/3.11 and python/3.10, and includes the dptools-24.1 extension."
