    "question": "What is the recommended CPU to GPU ratio for Volta nodes with 28 cores?",
    "answer": "You should maintain a CPU to GPU ratio of 3.5 or less on 28 core Volta nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPU cores should be requested for a job using 4 GPUs on a 28-core Volta node?",
    "answer": "For a job using 4 GPUs on a 28-core Volta node, you should request at most 14 CPU cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPU cores should be requested for a job using 1 GPU on a 28-core Volta node?",
    "answer": "For a job using 1 GPU on a 28-core Volta node, you should request at most 3 CPU cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any exceptions to the CPU to GPU ratio rule for short test jobs?",
    "answer": "Yes, users are allowed to run a few short test jobs (shorter than 1 hour) that break this rule to see how their code performs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended CPU to GPU ratio for the two newest 40-core Volta nodes?",
    "answer": "For the two newest 40-core Volta nodes, you can use 5 CPU cores per GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specifically request an NVLINK Volta node in a job submission script?",
    "answer": "To request an NVLINK Volta node, add the `--constraint=cascade,v100` parameter to your job submission script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the environment variable for the fast local temporary disk on Volta nodes?",
    "answer": "The environment variable for the fast local temporary disk on Volta nodes is `$SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should users utilize the fast local disk on Volta nodes for I/O intensive jobs?",
    "answer": "Users should copy input files to `$SLURM_TMPDIR` at the start of the job and copy output files out at the end, especially if the job performs significant I/O."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the files in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` after a job completes?",
    "answer": "All files in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` are automatically removed once the job ends, so no manual cleanup is needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Python virtual environments be created in `$SLURM_TMPDIR`?",
    "answer": "Yes, Python virtual environments can be created in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` for greater efficiency."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request Turing T4 GPUs in a job submission script?",
    "answer": "To request Turing T4 GPUs, you should specify `--gres=gpu:t4:2` in your job submission script, where '2' is the number of T4 cards per node requested."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request Ampere A100 GPUs in a job submission script?",
    "answer": "To request Ampere A100 GPUs, you should specify `--gres=gpu:a100:2` in your job submission script, where '2' is the number of A100 cards per node requested."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request Ampere A5000 GPUs in a job submission script?",
    "answer": "To request Ampere A5000 GPUs, you should specify `--gres=gpu:a5000:2` in your job submission script, where '2' is the number of A5000 cards per node requested."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example Slurm command to request a single Volta V100 GPU?",
    "answer": "An example Slurm command to request a single Volta V100 GPU is `--gres=gpu:v100:1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example Slurm command to request a full node with 8 Volta V100 GPUs exclusively?",
    "answer": "An example Slurm command to request a full node with 8 Volta V100 GPUs exclusively is `--nodes=1 --gres=gpu:v100:8 --exclusive`."
