  {
    "question": "What is the recommended CPU to GPU ratio for 28 core nodes on Graham?",
    "answer": "You should scale the number of CPUs requested, keeping the ratio of CPUs to GPUs at 3.5 or less on 28 core nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I want to run a job using 4 GPUs on a 28 core Volta node, how many CPU cores should I request?",
    "answer": "For a job using 4 GPUs on a 28 core node, you should request at most 14 CPU cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum number of CPU cores to request for a job using 1 GPU on a 28 core Volta node?",
    "answer": "For a job with 1 GPU on a 28 core node, you should request at most 3 CPU cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any exceptions to the CPU to GPU ratio rule for short test jobs?",
    "answer": "Yes, users are allowed to run a few short test jobs (shorter than 1 hour) that break this rule to see how their code performs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended CPU to GPU ratio for the two newest 40 core Volta nodes?",
    "answer": "On the two newest 40 core Volta nodes, you can use 5 CPU cores per GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I request one of the NVLINK nodes on Graham?",
    "answer": "You should request NVLINK nodes directly by adding the `--constraint=cascade,v100` parameter to your job submission script."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should the fast local disk on Volta nodes be utilized for jobs?",
    "answer": "The fast local disk should be used for jobs if the amount of I/O performed by your job is significant."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variable indicates the temporary directory on the fast local disk within a job?",
    "answer": "Inside the job, the location of the temporary directory on the fast local disk is specified by the environment variable `$SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to clean up files in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` after my job finishes?",
    "answer": "No, all the files in `$SLURM_TMPDIR` will be removed once the job ends, so you do not have to clean up that directory yourself."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Python virtual environments be created in `$SLURM_TMPDIR`?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can create Python virtual environments in this temporary space for greater efficiency."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request Turing GPU nodes on Graham?",
    "answer": "To request Turing GPU nodes, you should specify `--gres=gpu:t4:2` in your job submission script, for example, to request two T4 cards per node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request Ampere GPU nodes on Graham?",
    "answer": "To request Ampere GPU nodes, you should specify `--gres=gpu:a100:2` or `--gres=gpu:a5000:2` in your job submission script, for example, to request two Ampere cards per node."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did Graham's capacity get reduced, and to what percentage?",
    "answer": "Starting January 13, 2025, the Graham cluster began operating at approximately 25% capacity."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why was the Graham cluster's capacity reduced?",
    "answer": "The Graham cluster's capacity was reduced to make space for the installation of the new Nibi cluster."
