  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the scheduler information section for a GPU job?",
    "answer": "This section is dedicated to scheduler information, and from there, you can access your GPU account page by clicking on your account number."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can users do in the 'Ressources' section of a GPU job page?",
    "answer": "In the 'Ressources' section, users can get an initial overview of their task's resource utilization by comparing the 'Allou\u00e9s' (Allocated) and 'Utilis\u00e9s' (Used) columns for the listed parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'CPU' graph show on a GPU job page, and what customization options are available?",
    "answer": "The 'CPU' graph allows visualizing the usage of requested CPU cores over time. On the right, you can select/deselect different cores according to your needs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what condition is the 'CPU' graph not available for GPU tasks?",
    "answer": "For very short tasks, the 'CPU' graph is not available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'M\u00e9moire' (Memory) graph display for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'M\u00e9moire' graph allows visualizing the usage over time of the memory requested for the CPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of parameters are observable in the 'Process and threads' graph for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'Process and threads' graph allows observing different parameters related to processes and execution threads."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the file system usage graphs for a GPU task specifically represent?",
    "answer": "These graphs represent the file system usage for the current task, not the entire node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is depicted on the left side of the file system usage graph for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "On the left, a representation of the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) is displayed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is shown on the right side of the file system usage graph for a GPU task, and what is its purpose?",
    "answer": "On the right, the graph illustrates the data transfer rate between the task and the file system over time. This graph helps identify periods of intense activity or low utilization of the file system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the GPU graph represent regarding GPU usage?",
    "answer": "The GPU graph represents your GPU usage, detailing parameters like Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active, SM occupancy, Tensor usage, and Floating Point operations (FP64, FP32, FP16)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' parameter indicate in the GPU graph, and what is its ideal value?",
    "answer": "The 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' parameter indicates the percentage of time during which the GPU executes a warp (a group of consecutive threads) in the last sampling window. This value should ideally be around 80%."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is 'SM occupancy' defined, and what is its generally expected value?",
    "answer": "'SM occupancy' is defined as the ratio between the number of warps assigned to an SM and the maximum number of warps an SM can handle. A value around 50% is generally expected."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal value for the 'Tensor' parameter in the GPU graph, and why?",
    "answer": "The 'Tensor' parameter's value should be as high as possible, as your code should ideally exploit this part of the GPU, which is optimized for multidimensional matrix multiplications and convolutions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be observed for 'Floating Point' operations (FP64, FP32, and FP16) in the GPU graph?",
    "answer": "For 'Floating Point' operations (FP64, FP32, and FP16), you should observe significant activity on only one of these types, depending on the precision used by your code."
