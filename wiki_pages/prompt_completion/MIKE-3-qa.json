    "question": "What is the purpose of the provided job scripts for MIKE?",
    "answer": "The provided job scripts are examples for running MIKE 2023 and MIKE 2022 CPU-based simulations on an HPC cluster using SLURM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What SLURM resources are requested in the MIKE 2023 CPU job script?",
    "answer": "The MIKE 2023 CPU job script requests 1 node, 8 tasks, 1 CPU per task, 4000MB memory per CPU, and a time limit of 20 minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are loaded for running MIKE 2023 in the example script?",
    "answer": "For MIKE 2023, the modules `StdEnv/2020`, `intel/2021.2.0`, `intelmpi/2021.2.0`, and `mike/2023` are loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the MIKE engine executed in the MIKE 2023 job script?",
    "answer": "The MIKE engine, defined as 'FemEngineHD' with a model 'my_model.m3fm', is executed using `srun $engine $model` in the MIKE 2023 job script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variable is set for OpenMP threads in both MIKE 2023 and MIKE 2022 job scripts?",
    "answer": "The `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable is set to the value of `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` (or 1 if not defined) in both MIKE 2023 and MIKE 2022 job scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What SLURM resources are requested in the MIKE 2022 CPU job script?",
    "answer": "The MIKE 2022 CPU job script requests 1 node, 8 tasks, 1 CPU per task, 4000MB memory per CPU, and a time limit of 20 minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are loaded for running MIKE 2022 in the example script?",
    "answer": "For MIKE 2022, the modules `StdEnv/2020`, `intel/2020.1.217`, `intelmpi/2019.7.217`, and `mike/2022` are loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the execution command for MIKE 2022 differ from MIKE 2023 in the job scripts?",
    "answer": "For MIKE 2022, a machinefile is first generated using `slurm_hl2hl.py` and then the engine is run with `mpirun -machinefile machinefile.$SLURM_JOBID $engine $model`. In contrast, MIKE 2023 uses `srun $engine $model` directly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default values for the MIKE engine and model in the example job scripts?",
    "answer": "The default engine is set to `FemEngineHD` and the model is `my_model.m3fm` in both MIKE 2023 and MIKE 2022 job scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file is created to specify the host list for MPI in the MIKE 2022 job script?",
    "answer": "For MIKE 2022, a file named `machinefile.$SLURM_JOBID` is created using `slurm_hl2hl.py` to specify the MPI host list."
