    "question": "What is Kraken and its main goal?",
    "answer": "Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences, typically from metagenomic studies. It aims to achieve high sensitivity and speed by using exact k-mer alignments and a novel classification algorithm."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of software is Kraken?",
    "answer": "Kraken is bioinformatics (bio) software."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of Kraken are listed?",
    "answer": "The listed version for Kraken is 1.1.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between Kraken and Kraken2?",
    "answer": "Kraken2 is an updated version of Kraken, which also assigns taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences from metagenomic studies, utilizing exact k-mer alignments and a novel classification algorithm for high sensitivity and speed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage for Kraken2?",
    "answer": "The homepage for Kraken2 is https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of Kraken2 are available?",
    "answer": "Kraken2 is available in versions 2.0.9-beta, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is KrakenUniq?",
    "answer": "KrakenUniq is a metagenomics classifier that combines Kraken's fast k-mer-based classification with an efficient algorithm for assessing the coverage of unique k-mers in each species, aiming for better recall, precision, and effective classification of pathogens from false positives, while running as fast as Kraken with little additional memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage for KrakenUniq?",
    "answer": "The homepage for KrakenUniq is https://github.com/fbreitwieser/krakenuniq."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of KrakenUniq is mentioned?",
    "answer": "The mentioned version of KrakenUniq is 1.0.2."
