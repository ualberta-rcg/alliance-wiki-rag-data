  {
    "question": "What is krakenuniq and how does it improve upon Kraken?",
    "answer": "KrakenUniq is a metagenomics classifier that combines Kraken's fast k-mer-based classification with an efficient algorithm for assessing unique k-mer coverage, providing better recall and precision, especially for distinguishing low-abundance pathogens from false positives. It uses HyperLogLog for efficiency and runs as fast as Kraken with little additional memory."
