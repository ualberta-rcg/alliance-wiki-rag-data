    "question": "How is the monetary value of RAC allocations determined?",
    "answer": "The value of RAC allocations is calculated as an average across all facilities and includes the total capital and operational costs incurred by the Federation to deliver the resources and associated services. These are not commercial or market values."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the in-kind valuation of RAC allocations be used as a match for a CFI award?",
    "answer": "No, the in-kind valuation of RAC allocations cannot be used as a match for a CFI award."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might a RAC allocation be less than the amount requested?",
    "answer": "Our infrastructure is heavily oversubscribed each year, so a scaling function is applied to compute requests to make decisions on allocations when capacity is insufficient."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can a user do if their total RAC allocation is not sufficient for their needs?",
    "answer": "Any user can access modest quantities of compute, storage, and cloud resources through the Rapid Access Service if their total RAC allocation is not sufficient."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Rapid Access Service?",
    "answer": "The Rapid Access Service (RAS) is a shared pool of unallocated resources that allows users to access modest quantities of compute, storage, and cloud resources. Unlike RAC, it is not a guaranteed allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the Rapid Access Service a guaranteed allocation of computational resources?",
    "answer": "No, the Rapid Access Service is not a guaranteed allocation of certain computational resources; it is a shared pool of unallocated resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the system handle compute allocations if a user exceeds their total allocated amount?",
    "answer": "Compute allocations are based on a fair-share algorithm. If a user has recently used a large fraction of the system, their priority drops, but the system gradually 'forgets' past overuse. The total allocation represents what a user should get with a constant workload over the year, meaning users can continue working even after their 'total allocation' is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to a user's priority in the batch processing system if they overuse resources?",
    "answer": "If a user has used a large fraction of the system recently, their priority drops. However, the scheduling system has a limited time window and gradually 'forgets' the past overuse after some time of reduced usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary role of the Scientific Review Committees in the RAC process?",
    "answer": "The Scientific Review Committees peer-review and score all applications submitted to the RAC."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can applicants choose which Scientific Review Committee evaluates their proposal?",
    "answer": "Yes, applicants may choose the Scientific Review Committee they would like to review their proposals; however, the organization reserves the right to assign the proposal to another committee if necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some of the Scientific Review Committees available for RAC applications?",
    "answer": "The available committees include Astronomy, Astrophysics and Cosmology; Bioinformatics; Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biophysics; Computer Sciences and Mathematics; Engineering; Environmental and Earth Sciences; Humanities and Social Sciences; Nano, Materials and Condensed Matter; Neurosciences, Medical Imaging and Medical Physics; and Subatomic Physics, Nuclear Physics and Space Physics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are scientific reviewers required to do before accessing RAC applications?",
    "answer": "Scientific reviewers are required to accept the Alliance's Non-Disclosure Agreement and Conflict of Interest Policy prior to accessing any RAC application."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of the Resource Access Program Administrative Committee (RAPAC)?",
    "answer": "The RAPAC oversees the entire competition process, provides technical support, and is responsible for making allocations 'fit' on existing ARC resources, potentially applying scaling based on the overall score from scientific reviews."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who comprises the Resource Access Program Administrative Committee (RAPAC)?",
    "answer": "The RAPAC is composed of technical and administrative leaders representing each region, specifically BC DRI Group, Prairies DRI Group, Compute Ontario, Calcul Qu\u00e9bec, and ACENET."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is a Notice of Intent (NOI) required to apply for RAC?",
    "answer": "No, a Notice of Intent (NOI) is not required for any RAC application process."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the Resources for Research Groups (RRG) application process?",
    "answer": "The RRG is a peer-reviewed application process primarily for projects that require compute, storage, and cloud resources to conduct research."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a project primarily needs persistent instances in the cloud to provide a service, which application process should they use?",
    "answer": "Projects primarily needing persistent instances in the cloud to provide a service through a platform or a portal should apply through the Research Platforms and Portal application process instead of RRG."
