    "question": "How can I display only CPU-related profiling results using PGPROF?",
    "answer": "Use the `--cpu-profiling` option to display results for a single category, such as CPU-related data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which PGPROF option shows profiling results with the main function first, followed by its subordinate functions?",
    "answer": "The `--cpu-profiling-mode top-down` option displays results starting with the main function, followed by its subordinate functions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `--cpu-profiling-mode bottom-up` option?",
    "answer": "This option helps identify which part of the application requires the most execution time by showing results for each function, followed by its calling function, tracing back up to the main function."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can data collection and analysis be performed in the same session in PGPROF's graphical mode?",
    "answer": "Yes, in graphical mode, data collection and analysis can often be done in the same session."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to analyze a data file generated in command-line mode using PGPROF's graphical interface?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to analyze data from a file produced in command-line mode within the graphical interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should the PGPROF graphical user interface be executed, and why?",
    "answer": "Since the PGPROF GUI is Java-based, it should be executed on a compute node in an interactive session, rather than a login node, because login nodes typically lack sufficient memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can X11 redirection be enabled for an interactive session when preparing to use PGPROF's graphical mode?",
    "answer": "To activate X11 redirection, the interactive session can be started with `salloc --x11 ...`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to start a new data collection session in PGPROF's graphical mode?",
    "answer": "After launching the PGI profiler, start a new session via 'File > New Session', select the executable file to profile (adding any necessary arguments), then click 'Next' and 'Finish'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you display the top-down call tree view during analysis in PGPROF's graphical mode?",
    "answer": "In the 'CPU Details' pane, click on the button labeled 'Show the top-down (callers first) call tree view'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the four main panes found in PGPROF's graphical data visualization window?",
    "answer": "The four panes are the upper pane (showing events by execution time), 'GPU Details' (for GPU kernel performance), 'CPU Details' (for CPU function performance), and 'Properties' (for detailed information on a selected function)."
