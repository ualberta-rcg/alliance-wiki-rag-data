    "question": "What is the best practice to prevent environment variable conflicts when loading modules in a job script?",

    "question": "Why might a submitted job appear to hang or produce incomplete output for an extended period?",
    "answer": "A common reason for this is the aggressive buffering performed by the Slurm scheduler, which aggregates many output lines before flushing them to the log file. The output file might only be written after the job completes, or even be partly lost if the job is cancelled or runs out of time."
