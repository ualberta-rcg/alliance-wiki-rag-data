  {
    "question": "What is OpenMolcas?",
    "answer": "OpenMolcas is a quantum chemistry software package."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the key feature of OpenMolcas?",
    "answer": "Its key feature is the multiconfigurational approach, with methods like CASSCF and CASPT2."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is OpenMolcas a fork or reimplementation of Molcas?",
    "answer": "OpenMolcas is not a fork or reimplementation of Molcas; it is a large part of the Molcas codebase released as free and open-source software."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what license is OpenMolcas released?",
    "answer": "OpenMolcas is released under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are some parts of Molcas not included in OpenMolcas?",
    "answer": "Some parts of Molcas remain under a different license by decision of their authors (or impossibility to reach them), and are therefore not included in OpenMolcas."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users check available versions of the OpenMolcas module on national clusters?",
    "answer": "Users can check available versions using the `module spider openmolcas` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which scheduler is used for job submission on national clusters for OpenMolcas?",
    "answer": "The national clusters use the Slurm scheduler for job submission."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does OpenMolcas currently only support serial jobs on national clusters?",
    "answer": "OpenMolcas's parallel implementation uses Global Array, which does not work on the national clusters, so currently only serial jobs are supported."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended value for `--ntasks` in a serial OpenMolcas job script?",
    "answer": "For a serial OpenMolcas job, `--ntasks` should be set to 1."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the `MOLCAS_MEM` environment variable be set in an OpenMolcas job script?",
    "answer": "`MOLCAS_MEM` should normally be set to approximately 75% of the physical memory defined in `--mem-per-cpu`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `&GATEWAY` module in an OpenMolcas input file?",
    "answer": "The `&GATEWAY` module sets up the structure and basis sets for the calculation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `AMFI` keyword request within the `&GATEWAY` module?",
    "answer": "The `AMFI` keyword requests Atomic Mean Field Integrals for SOC (Spin-Orbit Coupling)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What function does the `&SEWARD` module perform in an OpenMolcas input file?",
    "answer": "The `&SEWARD` module performs all the one and two electron integrals for the given structure and basis sets."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of calculations are performed by the `&RASSCF` module?",
    "answer": "The `&RASSCF` module is used to do a CASSCF or RASSCF calculation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the spin multiplicity set in the `&RASSCF` module?",
    "answer": "Spin multiplicity is set using the `Spin=` parameter in the `&RASSCF` module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `CiRoot` parameter specify in the `&RASSCF` module?",
    "answer": "`CiRoot` specifies how many states are being calculated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `&RASSI` module?",
    "answer": "The `&RASSI` module performs a state interaction calculation between multiple CASSCF states of different spin."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you enable Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC) in the `&RASSI` module?",
    "answer": "Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC) is turned on using the `SPIN` keyword in the `&RASSI` module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `EPRG` parameter used for in the `&RASSI` module?",
    "answer": "The `EPRG` parameter in the `&RASSI` module is used to calculate g-values."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which module can calculate magnetic properties, even if not actively used anymore?",
    "answer": "The `&SINGLE_ANISO` module can calculate magnetic properties."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `TINT` define in the `&SINGLE_ANISO` module?",
    "answer": "`TINT` defines the susceptibility temperatures in the `&SINGLE_ANISO` module."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which command executes the OpenMolcas input file (`PrO2.inp`) in the example serial job script?",
    "answer": "The `pymolcas PrO2.inp` command executes the OpenMolcas input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default output filename specified in the example serial job script?",
    "answer": "The default output filename specified is `PrO2_serial.log`."
