    "answer": "Slicer provides free, powerful cross-platform processing tools to physicians, researchers, and the general public."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any restrictions on using 3D Slicer on login nodes?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is important to never make intense use of Slicer on the login nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if parallel rendering is used with Slicer on shared login nodes?",
    "answer": "Using parallel rendering on shared login nodes will result in the termination of your session."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended way to submit Slicer jobs?",
    "answer": "You should submit jobs using the command line whenever possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I need to visualize data using the Slicer GUI, where should I do it?",
    "answer": "If you must visualize your data using the GUI, please do so on an interactive node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to use the Slicer GUI?",
    "answer": "Using the Slicer GUI requires X11 forwarding, which you should make sure is enabled."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should an interactive node be used for the Slicer GUI instead of login nodes?",
    "answer": "Runtime is limited on the login nodes, so requesting an interactive job provides more time for exploring and visualizing data, and allows the use of more cores for faster processing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you request an interactive job that includes X11 forwarding for Slicer?",
    "answer": "You can request an interactive job using a command like `salloc --time=1:0:0 --ntasks=2 --x11 --account=def-someuser`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to load the Slicer software on an interactive node?",
    "answer": "You can load Slicer by using the command `module load slicer`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run the Slicer application after loading its module on an interactive node?",
    "answer": "After loading the module, you can run Slicer by executing the command `Slicer`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do to terminate an interactive job after you are done using Slicer?",
    "answer": "Once you are done and have closed Slicer, you should terminate the interactive job by typing `exit`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it advisable to use Slicer's command line interface and batch processing?",
    "answer": "You should use the command line interface and batch processing if you have to perform the same task on a large number of images, or if you don't need to see the processed images as they are created."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can examples for Slicer's command line and batch processing be found?",
    "answer": "Examples can be found on the Slicer discourse forum, specifically at `https://discourse.slicer.org/t/rtstruct-to-label-map/2437` and `https://discourse.slicer.org/t/slicer-batch-processing-question-no-main-window-python-script/1863`."
