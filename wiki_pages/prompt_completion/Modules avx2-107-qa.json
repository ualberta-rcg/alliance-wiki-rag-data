    "question": "What is regenie and what are its key features?",
    "answer": "Regenie is a C++ program for whole genome regression modelling of large genome-wide association studies, developed by the Regeneron Genetics Center. It handles quantitative and binary traits, including unbalanced case-control ratios, can process multiple phenotypes, supports Firth logistic regression and an SPA test for binary traits, performs gene/region-based burden tests, and is fast and memory-efficient. It supports BGEN, PLINK bed/bim/fam, and PLINK2 pgen/pvar/psam genetic data formats."
