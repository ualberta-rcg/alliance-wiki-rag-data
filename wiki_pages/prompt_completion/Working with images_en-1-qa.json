  {
    "question": "How does the procedure for creating an image of a VM depend on its boot method?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create an image from a VM that is booting from an ephemeral disk?",
    "answer": "Use the OpenStack command line clients with the command: `openstack server image create <server-name>`."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the two-step process for sharing an image with another project?",
    "answer": "First, a member of the project owning the image must share it with a second project. Second, a member of the second project must accept the newly shared image."
  },
  {
    "question": "What OpenStack command is used by the image-owning project member to share an image?",
    "answer": "A member in the project owning the image uses the command: `glance member-create <IMAGE_ID> <MEMBER_ID>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `<IMAGE_ID>` represent in the `glance member-create` command?",
    "answer": "`<IMAGE_ID>` is the ID of the image to be shared."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `<MEMBER_ID>` represent in the `glance member-create` command?",
    "answer": "`<MEMBER_ID>` is the ID of the project to share the image with."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a member of the second project accept a shared image?",
    "answer": "A member in the second project uses the command: `glance member-update <IMAGE_ID> <MEMBER_ID> <MEMBER_STATUS>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the valid values for `<MEMBER_STATUS>` when updating image membership?",
    "answer": "Valid Values for status are `accepted`, `rejected`, and `pending`."

    "answer": "You can list available images with the command: `openstack image list`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you download a particular OpenStack image?",
    "answer": "You can download a particular image with the command: `openstack image save --file ./<file-name-for-image>.<format> <ID>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is needed to download a specific image using the `openstack image save` command?",
    "answer": "The `<format>` which matches the Disk format column and the `<ID>` which matches the ID column of the image."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to upload an image to OpenStack?",
