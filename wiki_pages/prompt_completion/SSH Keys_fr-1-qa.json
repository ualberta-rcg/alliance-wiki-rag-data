  {
    "question": "What cryptographic method does SSH use to secure connections?",
    "answer": "SSH uses public-key cryptography (CP), also known as asymmetric cryptography, to secure connections."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does public-key cryptography differentiate between keys for encoding and decoding?",
    "answer": "In public-key cryptography, the private key remains secret and is used for decoding, while the public key can be divulged to others for encoding messages."
  },
  {
    "question": "Besides message encoding, what other function does a public key serve?",
    "answer": "A public key also allows for the validation of a user's identity."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which common internet protocols are built upon public-key cryptography?",
    "answer": "Public-key cryptography systems are fundamental to SSL and TLS protocols, which protect most internet communications, including HTTPS sites."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three main uses of public-key cryptography on clusters?",
    "answer": "On clusters, public-key cryptography is used by the SSH client to verify the server, to establish an encrypted session to prevent interception, and by the remote server to verify the user's identity for connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is authentication via public-key cryptography strongly recommended?",
    "answer": "Authentication via public-key cryptography (CP) is strongly recommended because it is usually more secure than using a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What two essential steps are required after generating an SSH key pair?",
    "answer": "You must generate a pair of keys and then install the public key on all systems to which you want to connect."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the safest place to create an SSH key pair?",
    "answer": "An SSH key pair should be created on your own computer or on an computer you believe to be secure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the crucial rule regarding the sharing or copying of a private SSH key?",
    "answer": "The private key of an SSH pair should not be shared or copied to another computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a passphrase, and why is it important when generating an SSH key pair?",
    "answer": "A passphrase is a string of characters used to encrypt your private key, providing protection if the private key is stolen."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended minimum length for an SSH passphrase?",
    "answer": "A minimum of 15 characters is recommended for an SSH passphrase."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find instructions for generating SSH keys on Windows clients like PuTTY or MobaXterm?",
    "answer": "For Windows clients like PuTTY or MobaXterm, users should consult the documentation titled 'G\u00e9n\u00e9rer des cl\u00e9s sous Windows'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to install a public SSH key via the CCDB method?",
    "answer": "The first step is to connect to CCDB via `https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/ssh_authorized_keys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user view their public SSH key on a Linux or macOS system?",
    "answer": "On Linux or macOS, a user can view their public SSH key by entering `cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub` in the command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if their public key was generated with PuTTY and they need to paste it for OpenSSH authorized_keys?",
    "answer": "If a key was generated with PuTTY, the user should open PuTTY Key Generator, select 'Load private key' under 'File', and then copy the content from 'Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the example public SSH key provided in the documentation be used for installation?",
    "answer": "No, the example public SSH key cannot be copied and used; you must generate your own unique key pair."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the final step in installing a public SSH key using the CCDB form after copying the key?",
    "answer": "The final step is to paste the public part of your key into the CCDB form, add an optional description, and then click 'Ajouter la cl\u00e9'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are SSH keys registered in CCDB also accessible by OpenStack clouds?",
    "answer": "No, SSH keys registered in CCDB do not have access to OpenStack clouds."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does it typically take for public key modifications to propagate to clusters after being registered in CCDB?",
    "answer": "Modifications to public keys typically propagate to clusters in a few minutes, but can sometimes take up to 30 minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is indicated by a public key starting with '-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----'?",
    "answer": "A public key starting with '-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----' indicates it is in PEM format and typically needs conversion before proceeding with installation, such as in step 3 of the CCDB process."
