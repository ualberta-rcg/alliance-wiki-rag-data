    "question": "What problem does Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology address?",
    "answer": "Many software are unable to fully exploit modern GPUs such as NVidia's A100 and H100."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does MIG stand for and what is its purpose?",
    "answer": "MIG stands for Multi-Instance GPU, and its purpose is to partition a single GPU into several virtual, completely independent instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are GPU instances created by MIG isolated from each other?",
    "answer": "Each GPU instance created by MIG is detached from other instances by on-chip protections."
  },
  {
    "question": "What resources does each GPU instance created by MIG have?",
    "answer": "Each GPU instance has a portion of the original GPU's compute resources and memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of using GPU instances for tasks?",
    "answer": "GPU instances are less resource-intensive, which means they use your compute priority slower, allowing you to execute more tasks with a shorter waiting time."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should tasks be evaluated and tested on a GPU instance?",
    "answer": "Tasks that use less than half of the compute power of an entire GPU and less than half of the available GPU memory should be evaluated and tested on an instance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do suitable tasks perform on a GPU instance compared to an entire GPU?",
    "answer": "In most cases, these tasks run just as quickly on an instance and consume less than half of the compute resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What limitation does MIG technology have regarding CUDA communication?",
    "answer": "MIG technology does not support CUDA interprocess communication, which optimizes data transfer via NVLink and NVSwitch."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the consequence of MIG not supporting CUDA interprocess communication?",
    "answer": "This limitation reduces the efficiency of communication between instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to launch an executable on multiple MIGs simultaneously?",
    "answer": "No, launching an executable on multiple MIGs at once does not improve performance and should be avoided."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does MIG technology support graphical APIs like OpenGL or Vulkan?",
    "answer": "No, graphical APIs such as OpenGL and Vulkan are not supported by MIG technology."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what condition might a task requiring a GPU still need an entire GPU instead of an instance, related to CPU cores?",
    "answer": "Tasks with a GPU that require many CPU cores per GPU may also require an entire GPU instead of an instance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors determine the maximum number of CPU cores per GPU instance?",
    "answer": "The maximum number of CPU cores per instance depends on the maximum number of CPU cores per entire GPU and the configured MIG profiles."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do MIG configurations and profiles vary?",
    "answer": "Yes, several MIG configurations and profiles are possible, but the profiles depend on the system and vary from one cluster to another and from one GPU node to another."
  },
  {
    "question": "What NVIDIA GPU is used for MIG instances on Narval?",
    "answer": "NVIDIA A100-40gb is used for MIG instances on Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "What NVIDIA GPU is used for MIG instances on Rorqual?",
    "answer": "NVIDIA H100-80gb is used for MIG instances on Rorqual."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example of a MIG profile name and what it signifies?",
    "answer": "An example is `3g.20gb`, which indicates the instance has 20GB of GPU memory and its performance is equal to 3/8ths of the compute performance of an entire GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does using less power for a MIG instance affect allocations and task priority?",
    "answer": "Requiring less power for a MIG instance decreases the impact on your allocation and on the priority assigned to your tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to list all GPU templates and full GPU names on a specific cluster?",
    "answer": "The command `sinfo -o \"%G\"|grep gpu|sed 's/gpu://g'|sed 's/,/\n/g'|cut -d: -f1|sort|uniq` can be used to list all templates and full GPU names on a specific cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find information about the maximum recommended CPU cores and system memory per instance?",
    "answer": "One can find information about the maximum recommended CPU cores and system memory per instance in 'le tableau des ratios'."
