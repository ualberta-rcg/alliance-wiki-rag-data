    "question": "How is the total number of cores (NCORES) calculated in the Fluent multinode (by node) OpenMPI script for Narval?",
    "answer": "The NCORES variable is calculated by multiplying `SLURM_NNODES`, `SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE`, and `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to execute Fluent for a single node in a multinode (by node) OpenMPI script on Narval?",
    "answer": "For a single node, Fluent is executed with: `fluent -g $MYVERSION -t $NCORES -affinity=0 -mpi=openmpi -pshmem -i $MYJOURNALFILE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to execute Fluent for multiple nodes in a multinode (by node) OpenMPI script on Narval?",
    "answer": "For multiple nodes, Fluent is executed with: `fluent -g $MYVERSION -t $NCORES -affinity=0 -mpi=openmpi -pib -cnf=/tmp/machinefile-$SLURM_JOB_ID -i $MYJOURNALFILE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the Slurm directives specified for memory and tasks in the Fluent multinode (by core) OpenMPI script on Narval?",
    "answer": "The script specifies `#SBATCH --ntasks=16` for the total number of cores and `#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4G` for memory per core."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules should be loaded for the Fluent multinode (by core) OpenMPI script on Narval?",
    "answer": "The script loads `StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2023R2` (or newer versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What OpenMPI-related environment variables are set in the Fluent multinode (by core) OpenMPI script on Narval?",
    "answer": "The script sets `export OPENMPI_ROOT=$EBROOTOPENMPI` and `export OMPI_MCA_hwloc_base_binding_policy=core`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the total number of cores (NCORES) calculated in the Fluent multinode (by core) OpenMPI script on Narval?",
    "answer": "NCORES is calculated as `SLURM_NTASKS * SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum number of cores per node allowed on Trillium for a Fluent job according to the multinode (by node) Intel script?",
    "answer": "The maximum number of cores per node specified in the script for Trillium is 192."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Ansys module is loaded in the Fluent multinode (by node) Intel script for Trillium?",
    "answer": "The script loads `ansys/2023R2` (or newer versions) along with `StdEnv/2023`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are license server settings configured in the Fluent multinode (by node) Intel script for Trillium, and what values are used?",
    "answer": "The script specifies `LICSERVER=license1.computecanada.ca`, `FLEXPORT=1055`, and `VENDPORT=1793`. It then uses `ssh tri-gw` to tunnel these ports to `localhost` and sets `ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE` and `ANSYSLI_SERVERS` accordingly, overriding the `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the machinefile for Fluent stored when running the multinode (by node) Intel script on Trillium?",
    "answer": "The machinefile is stored at `$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR/machinefile-$SLURM_JOB_ID`."
