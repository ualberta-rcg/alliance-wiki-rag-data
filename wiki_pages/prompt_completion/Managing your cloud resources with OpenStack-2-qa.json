  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of the default security group?",
    "answer": "The default security group contains rules that allow a VM to access the internet (for tasks like downloading OS upgrades or package installations) but does not permit other machines to access it, unless those machines belong to the same default security group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it recommended not to remove rules from the default security group?",
    "answer": "It is recommended not to remove rules from the default security group because doing so may cause problems when creating new VMs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the standard rules present in the default security group?",
    "answer": "The default security group typically includes two Egress rules (one for IPv4 and one for IPv6) allowing the instance unlimited access to an outside network, and two Ingress rules (one for IPv4 and one for IPv6) allowing communication for all VMs belonging to that security group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it safe to add rules to the default security group?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is safe to add rules to the default security group."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are examples of rules that might be added to the default security group?",
    "answer": "Examples include adding security rules for SSH or RDP access to allow connection to your VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a VM belong to more than one security group?",
    "answer": "Yes, a VM can belong to more than one security group, and you can define multiple security groups."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key consideration when managing security groups and rules?",
    "answer": "When managing security groups and rules, it is important to carefully consider what needs to be accessed and who needs to access it, striving to minimize the IP addresses and ports specified in your Ingress rules."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you restrict SSH access to a VM from a specific computer with a static IP?",
    "answer": "To restrict SSH access to a VM from a specific computer with a static IP, you can use the CIDR box to specify the allowed IP or IP range."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for SSH access if you want to use one VM as a gateway to others?",
    "answer": "If you only need to connect to one VM via SSH from the outside and then use it as a gateway to other cloud VMs, it's advisable to put the SSH rule in a separate security group and add that group only to the gateway VM, ensuring SSH keys are correctly configured for inter-VM communication."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can you choose the security groups a VM belongs to?",
    "answer": "The security groups a VM belongs to can be chosen during its creation using the 'Security Groups' option on the 'Launch Instance' page, or after the VM has been launched by selecting 'Edit Security Groups' from the drop-down menu on the 'Project->Compute->Instances' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does CIDR stand for?",
    "answer": "CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is CIDR used for?",
    "answer": "CIDR is a standardized way of defining IP ranges."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the CIDR rule `192.168.1.1/24`.",
    "answer": "The CIDR rule `192.168.1.1/24` means it will match the first 24 bits (3 bytes) of an IP address. Any IP address starting with `192.168.1` will match this rule."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `/32` mean in a CIDR rule?",
    "answer": "If `/32` is appended to an IP address in a CIDR rule, it means the full 32 bits of the IP address must match exactly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `/0` mean in a CIDR rule?",
    "answer": "If `/0` is appended to an IP address in a CIDR rule, it means no bits must match, and therefore any IP address will match it."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can you use cloudInit to customize an instance?",
    "answer": "You can use cloudInit to customize an instance the first time it is launched."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can cloudInit be used to customize an instance?",
    "answer": "CloudInit can be used either via the OpenStack command-line interface or by pasting a cloudInit script into the 'Customization Script' field of the OpenStack dashboard (found under 'Project-->Compute-->Instances-->Launch instance' button, 'Configuration' option)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you add multiple users with different permissions during VM creation using cloudInit?",
    "answer": "You can add multiple users with different permissions by including a cloudInit script that lists each user's name, shell, sudo permissions (e.g., `sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`), and SSH authorized keys."
