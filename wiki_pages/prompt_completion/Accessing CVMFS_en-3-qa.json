    "question": "Which system paths are automatically added to the default MODULEPATH by the software environment?",
    "answer": "The paths `/opt/software/modulefiles` and `$HOME/modulefiles` are automatically added to the default `MODULEPATH` if they exist."
  },
  {
    "question": "What system paths are automatically added to the default PATH for executables?",
    "answer": "The paths `/opt/software/slurm/bin`, `/opt/software/bin`, and `/opt/slurm/bin` are automatically added to the default `PATH`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Since when has the software environment supported installing additional modules locally and discovering them centrally?",
    "answer": "The software environment has supported installing additional modules locally and having them discovered by the central hierarchy since June 2020."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you enable local software to be discovered by the central software hierarchy?",
    "answer": "First, identify and ensure a path for local software exists (e.g., `/opt/software/easybuild`). Then, export the environment variable `RSNT_LOCAL_MODULEPATHS` like `export RSNT_LOCAL_MODULEPATHS=/opt/software/easybuild/modules`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended way to install software packages locally using EasyBuild to be found by the module hierarchy?",
    "answer": "After setting `RSNT_LOCAL_MODULEPATHS`, install software using EasyBuild with the command `eb --installpath /opt/software/easybuild <some easyconfig recipe>`."

  {
    "question": "Why should system administrators avoid relying on the software environment during privileged operations related to CVMFS?",
    "answer": "System administrators should ensure their session does not depend on the software environment during privileged operations or CVMFS-related tasks to prevent potential deadlocks or hangs if CVMFS access is temporarily interrupted, which could interfere with updates or reconfigurations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are commercial software packages, such as Intel and Portland Group compilers, available externally through this software environment?",
    "answer": "No, commercial software packages like Intel and Portland Group compilers are not available externally due to license terms. Users will only have access to their redistributable parts, typically shared objects, which are sufficient for running but not compiling new software."

  {
    "question": "Where does the software environment expect NVIDIA CUDA driver libraries to be located?",
    "answer": "The software environment relies on NVIDIA CUDA driver libraries being installed in the path `/usr/lib64/nvidia`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended solution if recent NVIDIA drivers install libraries in `/usr/lib64` instead of `/usr/lib64/nvidia`?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to create symbolic links in `/usr/lib64/nvidia` that point to the NVIDIA libraries installed in `/usr/lib64`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a script available to create symbolic links for NVIDIA libraries on RedHat-based systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, a script named `script_for_redhat.sh` is provided that installs NVIDIA drivers and creates the necessary symbolic links in `/usr/lib64/nvidia`."
