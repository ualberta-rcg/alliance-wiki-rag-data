    "question": "What types of rendering can be performed on cluster CPUs for large-scale interactive visualization?",
    "answer": "Both rasterization and ray tracing can be performed on cluster CPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modern CPU-based libraries are mentioned for offering performance similar to GPU-based rendering?",
    "answer": "OSPRay and OpenSWR are modern CPU-based libraries that offer performance quite similar to GPU-based rendering."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the ParaView server support parallel rendering for very large datasets?",
    "answer": "The ParaView server uses MPI for distributed-memory processing, enabling parallel rendering on a large number of CPU cores, either on a single node or scattered across multiple nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one estimate the number of CPU cores required for rendering a dataset?",
    "answer": "To estimate the number of necessary cores, divide the amount of memory you anticipate needing for your rendering by approximately 3.5 GB/core."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended maximum memory allocation per core for software rendering?",
    "answer": "For software rendering, it is not recommended to allocate more than 4GB/core because it is CPU-intensive."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might additional memory be needed beyond what's required to hold the dataset itself?",
    "answer": "Additional memory is important for filters and data processing, as operations like structured to unstructured dataset conversion can increase the memory footprint by approximately 3X."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do if your ParaView server terminates during data processing?",
    "answer": "If your ParaView server gets killed when processing data, you will need to increase the number of cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum core requirement for visualization jobs on the Trillium cluster?",
    "answer": "On Trillium, jobs must be scheduled on whole nodes, which are in multiples of 192 cores, so the minimum example will require 192 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial steps to set up a large-scale interactive client-server ParaView session?",
    "answer": "First, install the same ParaView version on your computer as the one on the cluster, then log into the cluster and start a parallel CPU interactive job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the general `salloc` command used to start a parallel CPU interactive job for visualization?",
    "answer": "The general `salloc` command is `salloc --time=1:00:0 --ntasks=... --mem-per-cpu=3600 --account=def-someprof`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `salloc` command would you use for a visualization job on Trillium, assuming one node?",
    "answer": "On Trillium, the command for one node visualization would be `salloc --time=1:00:0 --ntasks=192 --account=def-someprof`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific module must be loaded on Trillium before loading the ParaView module?",
    "answer": "On Trillium, you must load the `StdEnv/2023` module before attempting to load `paraview/6.0.0`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start the ParaView server within a parallel CPU interactive job?",
    "answer": "You start the ParaView server using the command: `srun pvserver --force-offscreen-rendering --opengl-window-backend OSMesa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the SSH command `ssh <username>@fir.alliancecan.ca -L 11111:fc30669:11111` in the client-server setup?",
    "answer": "This SSH command links port 11111 on your local computer to port 11111 on the remote compute node (`fc30669` in this example), creating a tunnel for the ParaView client-server connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the specialized SSH command for establishing a client-server connection with Nibi, and what is the function of the `-T` flag?",
    "answer": "For Nibi, the command is `ssh -T -J <username>@nibi.alliancecan.ca -L 11111:localhost:11111 <username>@<nibi_compute_node>`. The `-T` flag disables pseudo-terminal allocation, which is important for facilitating the initial client-server handshake due to Nibi's network traffic blocking."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure the ParaView client on your local machine to connect to the remote parallel server?",
    "answer": "In ParaView GUI, go to 'File -> Connect', click 'Add Server', set 'Server Type' to 'Client/Server', 'Host' to 'localhost', and 'Port' to '11111'. Click 'Configure', select 'Manual', and 'Save', then select the server from the list and click 'Connect'."
