    "question": "What is Colvars and what capabilities does it add to molecular simulation programs?",
    "answer": "Colvars is a software module that adds capabilities of collective variables to molecular simulation programs. It allows for applying biasing potentials, calculating potentials-of-mean-force (PMFs), and using enhanced sampling methods such as Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF), metadynamics, steered MD, and umbrella sampling."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the Colvars library integrated with GROMACS versions 2024 and newer?",
    "answer": "As of GROMACS v2024, the Colvars library has been officially integrated into GROMACS releases, meaning it can be used without needing a patched version."
  },
  {
    "question": "How were GROMACS versions prior to v2024 used with Colvars?",
    "answer": "GROMACS versions prior to v2024 required that they be patched with Colvars modifications to enable the use of collective variables in simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which `gromacs-colvars` module is available for GROMACS v2020.6?",
    "answer": "For GROMACS v2020.6 with Colvars 2021-12-20, the CPU module is `StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 openmpi/4.0.3 gromacs-colvars/2020.6` and the GPU (CUDA) module is `StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 cuda/11.4 openmpi/4.0.3 gromacs-colvars/2020.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find documentation on using Colvars with GROMACS?",
    "answer": "Documentation can be found in the GROMACS Reference manual on 'Collective Variable simulations with the Colvars module', the GROMACS User guide for Colvars .mdp Options, the Colvars Reference manual for GROMACS, and the publication by Fiorin et al. (2013) 'Using collective variables to drive molecular dynamics simulations.'"

  {
    "question": "What is CP2K?",
    "answer": "CP2K is a quantum chemistry and solid-state physics software package."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of simulations can be performed using GROMACS with CP2K support?",
    "answer": "GROMACS with CP2K support enables Hybrid Quantum-Classical simulations (QM/MM)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Since which GROMACS version can it be compiled with CP2K support?",
    "answer": "Since version 2022, GROMACS can be compiled with CP2K support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics of `gromacs-cp2k` modules regarding hardware support and executables?",
    "answer": "`gromacs-cp2k` modules are available only for CPU calculations (not GPUs/CUDA) and contain only MPI-enabled executables: `gmx_mpi` (mixed precision) and `gmx_mpi_d` (double precision)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which `gromacs-cp2k` module is listed for GROMACS v2022.2?",
    "answer": "For GROMACS v2022.2 with CP2K 9.1, the CPU module is `StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 openmpi/4.0.3 gromacs-cp2k/2022.2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What adjustments are necessary when using BioExcel tutorial material for GROMACS + CP2K on HPC systems?",
    "answer": "The command `gmx_cp2k` needs to be replaced with either `gmx_mpi` (mixed precision) or `gmx_mpi_d` (double precision), and the Slurm job scripts need to be adjusted accordingly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is GROMACS-LS and what does the MDStress library do?",
    "answer": "GROMACS-LS is a modified version of GROMACS that, along with the included MDStress library, enables the calculation of local stress fields from molecular dynamics simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the manual for GROMACS-LS?",
    "answer": "The manual for GROMACS-LS can be found at [https://vanegaslab.org/files/Local_stress.pdf Local_stress.pdf]."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a trajectory simulated with a newer GROMACS version (e.g., 2024) be analyzed using GROMACS-LS 2016.3?",
    "answer": "To analyze a trajectory from a newer GROMACS version, you can use `gmx_LS grompp` or `gmx grompp` from the `gromacs/2016.6` module to create a new `.tpr` file from the original input files. This new `.tpr` will then be compatible with GROMACS-LS 2016.3."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command changes are required when using GROMACS-LS compared to GROMACS version 5 and newer?",
    "answer": "Because the GROMACS-LS manual was written for an older version (v4.5.5) and core GROMACS commands changed in version 5, you need to use commands like `gmx_LS mdrun` and `gmx_LS trjconv` instead of `mdrun_LS` and `trjconv_LS`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations of GROMACS-LS regarding parallelization and hardware acceleration?",
    "answer": "GROMACS-LS requires double precision compilation, does not support MPI, SIMD hardware acceleration, or GPUs, and can only use a single CPU core, making it much slower than normal GROMACS."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can `gromacs-ls/2016.3` and `gromacs/2016.6` modules be loaded simultaneously?",
    "answer": "Yes, unlike other patched versions of GROMACS, the modules `gromacs-ls/2016.3` and `gromacs/2016.6` can be loaded at the same time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the CPU module for `gromacs-ls/2016.3`?",
    "answer": "The CPU module for `gromacs-ls/2016.3` is `StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 gromacs-ls/2016.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the CPU module for `gromacs/2016.6` and its purpose?",
    "answer": "The CPU module for `gromacs/2016.6` is `StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 openmpi/4.1.5 gromacs/2016.6`. This GROMACS module can be used to prepare TPR input files for GROMACS-LS."
