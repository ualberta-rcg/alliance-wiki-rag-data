    "question": "How do a user's I/O activities affect others on a shared file system?",
    "answer": "A user's I/O activities, such as how they read/write, their file format, the number of files, and how often they use commands like 'ls', affect every user. High I/O can slow down the system and hammering the file system can hinder process communications, including MPI communication, impacting others."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a user performs very high I/O activities in a directory?",
    "answer": "Very high I/O activities in a directory can make the system slower for everyone."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the general limitations of file systems?",
    "answer": "File systems are limited in terms of bandwidth, IOPs (I/O operations per second), the number of files they can handle, and available space."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are parallel file systems optimized for small files?",
    "answer": "No, parallel file systems are optimized for large shared files and show very poor performance when storing many small-sized files or under many small reads/writes (high IOPs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary recommendation for managing data needs in HPC systems?",
    "answer": "It is always recommended to make a plan for your data needs, including how much will be generated, how much you need to save, and where you will keep it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the consequences of ignoring quotas on national systems?",
    "answer": "Different file systems (home, project, scratch) have different quotas, and scratch data is subject to expiry. These limits must be taken into account before submitting a job."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which file system commands should be minimized, especially in large directories?",
    "answer": "Users should minimize the use of filesystem commands like 'ls' and 'du', particularly in directories containing many files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How often should users check their disk usage?",
    "answer": "Users should regularly check their disk usage with the 'quota' command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the warning signs that indicate a user might be having I/O issues or negatively impacting the system?",
    "answer": "Warning signs include having more than 100,000 files in your space and an average data file size less than 100 MB, especially when writing lots of data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What 'housekeeping' practices are recommended for managing files?",
    "answer": "Regular 'housekeeping' is recommended, which includes using gzip and tar commands to compress and group multiple files, and deleting unnecessary files, to maintain a reasonable number of files and manage quotas."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is ASCII data format?",
    "answer": "ASCII, or American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a human-readable file format, also referred to as 'text' format."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the advantages of ASCII data format?",
    "answer": "The advantages of ASCII format are that it is human-readable and portable (architecture independent)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the disadvantages of ASCII data format?",
    "answer": "ASCII format is inefficient for storage (e.g., 13 bytes per single precision float, 22 bytes per double precision, plus delimiters) and is expensive for read/write operations."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is ASCII format suitable for use?",
    "answer": "ASCII format is good for small input or parameter files to run a code."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one identify ASCII file writing in C or FORTRAN code?",
    "answer": "In C code, `fprintf()` is used, and in FORTRAN 90, `open(6,file='test',form='formatted'); write(6,*)` indicates ASCII file writing."
