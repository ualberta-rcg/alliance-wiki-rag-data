    "question": "What is the ABINIT program used for?",
    "answer": "ABINIT is a software suite designed to calculate the optical, mechanical, vibrational, and other observable properties of materials. It uses quantum equations of density functional theory and can handle molecules, nanostructures, and solids."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check which versions of ABINIT are available?",
    "answer": "You can see available versions by running the command `module spider abinit`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I find out about module dependencies for a specific ABINIT version?",
    "answer": "To check for other modules that must be loaded first for a specific version, run `module spider abinit/VERSION_NUMBER`, for example, `module spider abinit/8.4.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are atomic data files for ABINIT maintained by the system?",
    "answer": "No, a collection of atomic data files for ABINIT is not maintained by the system."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should I get atomic data files for ABINIT calculations?",
    "answer": "You should obtain the necessary atomic data files by following the links from the 'Atomic data files' page on the ABINIT website (https://www.abinit.org/downloads/atomic-data-files)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I download atomic data files to a login node?",
    "answer": "Since these files rarely exceed 1 megabyte, they can be downloaded directly to any login node using `wget` and the data file's URL, for example, `wget http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/pseudos/nc-sr-04_pbe_standard/H.psp8.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are data files for ABINIT tutorials and tests located?",
    "answer": "Data files for tutorials and tests can be found at `$EBROOTABINIT/share/abinit-test/Psps_for_tests/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find input files referenced in the ABINIT tutorial?",
    "answer": "Input files mentioned in the ABINIT tutorial are located at `$EBROOTABINIT/share/abinit-test/tutorial`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should ABINIT calculations (excluding trivial tests) be executed?",
    "answer": "ABINIT calculations, apart from trivial tests or tutorial examples, should be run via the Slurm job scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "What job scheduler is recommended for running ABINIT calculations?",
    "answer": "Slurm is the recommended job scheduler for running ABINIT calculations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example command for running ABINIT within a Slurm job script?",
    "answer": "An example command in a Slurm job script is `srun abinit < parameters.txt >& output.log`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What resources does the example ABINIT job script request?",
    "answer": "The example job script requests 64 CPU cores across two nodes for 48 hours, with 1024 MB of memory per core."
