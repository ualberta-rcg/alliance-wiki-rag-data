    "question": "How can I run a Workbench replay file on a cluster?",
    "answer": "You can run a Workbench replay file by loading the Ansys module (e.g., `module load ansys/2019R3`), removing any lock file (`rm -f test_files/.lock`), and then executing `runwb2 -R myreplay.wbjn`."

  {
    "question": "How do you check the resource utilization of an Ansys Additive job once it's running on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "After a few minutes of job execution, you can get a snapshot of its resource utilization on the compute node(s) using the `srun --jobid=myjobid top -bn1 -u $USER | grep R | grep -v top` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I determine the optimal number of cores and memory for an Ansys Additive job?",
    "answer": "To determine the optimal number of cores and memory, you should submit several short test jobs and perform scaling tests. After a job completes, obtain its \"Job Wall-clock time\" using `seff myjobid` and consider adding more cores if the Wall-clock time decreases by approximately 50% when the number of cores is doubled."
