  },
  {
    "question": "How does `IMPUTE5` achieve its efficiency?",
    "answer": "`IMPUTE5` achieves fast, accurate, and memory-efficient imputation by selecting haplotypes using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT) at genotyped markers, identifying locally best matching haplotypes and long identical by state segments, and using these as conditioning states within the IMPUTE model."
