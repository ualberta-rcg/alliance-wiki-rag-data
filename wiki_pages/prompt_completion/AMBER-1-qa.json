  {
    "question": "What is Amber?",
    "answer": "Amber is a collective name for a suite of programs designed for performing molecular dynamics simulations, especially on biomolecules."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three main Amber modules provided?",
    "answer": "The main Amber modules provided are Amber, AmberTools, and Amber-PMEMD."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the AmberTools module (`ambertools`) offer?",
    "answer": "AmberTools provides utilities for preparing and analyzing simulations, `QUICK` for GPU-accelerated DFT calculations, and `sander` for molecular dynamics. It is free and open source."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is included in the Amber module (`amber`)?",
    "answer": "The `amber` module includes everything found in AmberTools, plus the advanced `pmemd` program for high-performance molecular dynamics simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Amber-PMEMD (`amber-pmemd`) and when was it introduced as a standalone module?",
    "answer": "Amber-PMEMD is a high-performance MD engine `pmemd`, optimized for CPU and GPU. It was made a standalone module starting with Amber 24 because `pmemd` no longer requires AmberTools for compilation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the `amber-pmemd` module include AmberTools?",
    "answer": "No, the `amber-pmemd` module does not include AmberTools. To use both, the `ambertools` module must be loaded separately."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users check installed Amber versions and their dependencies?",
    "answer": "Users can check installed Amber versions and their dependencies using the `module spider` command or by visiting the Available software page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are older AMBER modules compatible with NVIDIA H100 GPUs?",
    "answer": "No, older AMBER modules are incompatible with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. New modules are required for GPU-accelerated runs on these clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Amber modules are required for H100 GPU clusters?",
    "answer": "For GPU-accelerated runs on H100 GPU clusters, users should use `ambertools/25.0` or `amber-pmemd/24.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific feature do `ambertools/25.0` and `amber-pmemd/24.3` modules include for H100 GPUs?",
    "answer": "These modules include H100-specific CUDA kernels, which are compiled with CUDA 12+ for the Hopper architecture."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if legacy AMBER modules are used for GPU jobs on H100 nodes?",
    "answer": "Legacy AMBER modules will fail if used for GPU jobs on H100 nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are needed to run `amber-pmemd/24.3` on GPUs with `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "The required modules are `StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 openmpi/4.1.5 cuda/12.6 amber-pmemd/24.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is `ambertools/25.0` compatible with H100 GPUs?",
    "answer": "Yes, `ambertools/25.0` is H100 compatible and also includes PLUMED/2.9.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which AmberTools module is currently available on all clusters?",
    "answer": "AmberTools 21 is currently available on all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What MD engines does AmberTools 21 provide?",
    "answer": "AmberTools 21 provides `sander`, `sander.LES`, `sander.LES.MPI`, `sander.MPI`, `sander.OMP`, `sander.quick.cuda`, and `sander.quick.cuda.MPI`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you set AMBER environment variables after loading an AmberTools module?",
    "answer": "After loading the module, you should `source $EBROOTAMBERTOOLS/amber.sh` to set AMBER environment variables."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two versions of `amber/20` modules and their key differences?",
    "answer": "The two versions are `amber/20.9-20.15` which uses MKL and cuda/11.0, and `amber/20.12-20.15` which uses FlexiBLAS and cuda/11.4."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does `amber/20.12-20.15` use FlexiBLAS instead of MKL?",
    "answer": "FlexiBLAS is used because MKL libraries do not perform well on AMD CPUs. FlexiBLAS detects the CPU type and uses optimized libraries for the hardware."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is `cuda/11.4` required for in `amber/20.12-20.15`?",
    "answer": "`cuda/11.4` is required for running simulations on A100 GPUs installed on Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "What MD programs do CPU-only `Amber/20` modules provide beyond AmberTools/20 programs?",
    "answer": "CPU-only `Amber/20` modules provide `pmemd` (serial) and `pmemd.MPI` (parallel) in addition to all MD programs available in AmberTools/20."
