    "question": "How is a Resource Allocation Project (RAP) associated with a job in Slurm?",
    "answer": "Each job submitted to the Slurm job scheduler has an associated Resource Allocation Project (RAP), which is selected using the `--account` option with `sbatch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors determine the scheduling priority of a job in Slurm?",
    "answer": "The scheduling priority of a job is determined by the target share of its associated account relative to that account's recent usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the usage of one user within a RAP account affect others in the same group?",
    "answer": "The usage of all users within a Resource Allocation Project (RAP) is charged to a single account, meaning each user affects the priority of jobs submitted by all other users in the group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might active coordination among users be beneficial for a research group's throughput?",
    "answer": "Active coordination among users may improve a project's throughput because all usage within a RAP is charged to a single account, and individual job submissions affect the priority of all jobs in the group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances can managing usage within a RAP account be particularly useful?",
    "answer": "Managing usage within a RAP account can be useful when a user who has not utilized many resources finds their job has very low priority because other users in the group have recently run a lot of work."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the fairshare principle (LevelFS) in the context of RAP accounts?",
    "answer": "The fairshare principle (LevelFS) is applied both within and between groups. When an account's fairshare is low due to high usage, all users must wait for it to return to a competitive value, with jobs from underserved users having the highest priority when it recovers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might a user with high priority still struggle to run jobs even after the group's fairshare recovers?",
    "answer": "This can happen if users in the group have drastically different job requirements; for instance, if one user runs many small jobs that fit into 'back filling' or 'cycle scavenging' gaps, making it difficult for others with greater resource needs to run."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some general strategies for managing usage within RAP accounts?",
    "answer": "Strategies include discussing and scheduling usage in lab meetings, using different clusters, utilizing multiple accounts (like a RAC award and a default account), or having each Principal Investigator obtain their own account for collaborations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does using different clusters help manage job priority for a RAP account?",
    "answer": "Using different clusters helps because each RAP is independently accounted on each cluster. This means a user's activity on one cluster will not affect the priority of jobs submitted by other users to the same account on a different cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a group with a RAC award use multiple accounts to improve job management?",
    "answer": "A group with a RAC award can submit jobs to both their RAC account and a default account; jobs running under one account will not affect the fairshare of the other account, providing more flexibility."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if the internal strategies for managing RAP account usage are ineffective?",
    "answer": "If the strategies for managing usage within RAP accounts are ineffective, users should contact an analyst for further assistance."
