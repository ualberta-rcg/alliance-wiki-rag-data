  },
  {
    "question": "How do allocations of storage and cloud resources differ from CPU and GPU allocations?",
    "answer": "Allocations of storage space and cloud resources are maxima that cannot be exceeded, while CPU and GPU allocations are targets for average usage translated into scheduling priorities."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is meant by a storage allocation for a research group?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What does an allocation of N CPUs signify for a group?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Are periods of greater CPU or GPU usage guaranteed if a group has an allocation?",
    "answer": "Periods of greater usage may be possible as competing demand allows, but are not guaranteed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will a group be compensated for periods of lesser CPU or GPU usage?",
    "answer": "No, periods of lesser usage will not be compensated, whether due to the group\u2019s actions or resource unavailability."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a cluster in batch computing?",
    "answer": "A cluster is a group of interconnected compute nodes managed as a unit by a scheduling program."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a compute node?",
    "answer": "A compute node is a computational unit of a cluster, which can be allocated to a job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What resources does a compute node typically have?",
    "answer": "A node has its own operating system image, one or more CPU cores and some memory (RAM)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can jobs utilize compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Nodes can be used by jobs in either an exclusive or shared manner depending on the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a core-year?",
    "answer": "A core-year is the equivalent of using 1 CPU core continuously for a full year."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are compute allocations typically based?",
    "answer": "Compute allocations are based on core-years allocations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example of usage equivalent to 1 core-year.",
    "answer": "Using 12 cores for a month, or 365 cores for a single day, are both equivalent to 1 core-year."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a core-equivalent?",
    "answer": "A core-equivalent is a bundle made up of a single core and some amount of associated memory, or a core plus the amount of memory considered to be associated with each core on a given system."

  {
    "question": "What is a GPU-year?",
    "answer": "A GPU-year is the equivalent of using 1 GPU continuously for a full year or 12 GPUs for a month."

  },
  {
    "question": "Give an example calculation of an RGU-year.",
    "answer": "10 GPU-years of an A100-40GB (which costs 4 RGU) equals 40 RGU-years."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Head or Login node in a cluster?",
    "answer": "A Head or Login node is typically the launching point for jobs running on the cluster and acts as a middle point between the actual cluster and the outside network, where users are directed to log in."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is batch processing priority generally determined?",
    "answer": "Batch processing priority is generally allocated based on a fair-share algorithm."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to a user's priority if they have recently used a large fraction of the system under a fair-share allocation?",
    "answer": "If a user has used a large fraction of the system recently, their priority drops."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the fair-share scheduling system handle past overuse?",
    "answer": "After some time (e.g., weeks) of reduced usage, the scheduling system gradually 'forgets' that a user overused in the past."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the fair-share allocation design?",
    "answer": "It is designed to ensure full system usage and not to penalize users who take advantage of idle compute resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is a user's total allocation a strict limit on their resource consumption?",
    "answer": "No, a user's total allocation is not a limit on how many compute resources they can consume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a total allocation represent under the fair-share system?",
    "answer": "A total allocation represents what a user should be able to get over the course of the year if they submit a constant workload to the system and it is fully busy."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if their 'total allocation' is used?",
    "answer": "Once their 'total allocation' is used, they should just keep working."
