    "question": "What is LS-DYNA used for?",
    "answer": "LS-DYNA is used for many applications to solve problems in multiphysics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics, performing analyses as separate phenomena or coupled physics simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who recently purchased LSTC, the developer of LS-DYNA?",
    "answer": "Ansys recently purchased LSTC, the developer of LS-DYNA."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Alliance's role regarding LS-DYNA software?",
    "answer": "The Alliance is a hosting provider for LS-DYNA, meaning they have the software installed on their clusters, but they do not provide a generic license or license hosting services."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the Alliance provide a generic LS-DYNA license to all users?",
    "answer": "No, the Alliance does NOT provide a generic license accessible to everyone or provide license hosting services."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who typically provides LS-DYNA licenses for use on the clusters?",
    "answer": "Many institutions, faculties, and departments already have licenses that can be used on the clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required for cluster compute nodes to reach an institution's LS-DYNA license?",
    "answer": "Some cluster-specific network changes will generally need to be done."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can users contact if they are unable to locate or arrange for a license on campus?",
    "answer": "Users may contact CMC Microsystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an advantage of LS-DYNA licenses purchased from CMC Microsystems?",
    "answer": "Licenses purchased from CMC do not require the overhead of hosting a local license server as they are hosted on a remote server system managed by CMC and can be used anywhere."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted for a quote on a locally managed LS-DYNA license if you have your own server?",
    "answer": "Consider contacting Simutech or Ansys directly."
  },
  {

    "answer": "No, SHARCNET does not provide any free LS-DYNA licenses or license hosting services at this time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What must be done if a new or existing LS-DYNA license server has never been used on a cluster?",
    "answer": "Firewall changes will first need to be done on both the cluster side and server side."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is typically involved in arranging firewall changes for a license server?",
    "answer": "It typically requires involvement from both our technical team and the technical people managing your license software."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information should be sent to technical support to arrange firewall changes for a floating license server?",
    "answer": "An email containing the service port and IP address of your floating license server should be sent to technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you test if your LS-DYNA license file is working?",
    "answer": "Run `module load ls-dyna` followed by `ls-dyna_s` or `ls-dyna_d` without any input file or arguments."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should the output header show when testing an LS-DYNA license to indicate it's working (excluding CMC license servers)?",
    "answer": "The output header should contain a non-empty value for `Licensed to:`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you exit the LS-DYNA test program?",
    "answer": "Press ^C to quit the program and return to the command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of license servers are used for LS-DYNA licenses?",
    "answer": "LS-DYNA licenses issued by Ansys use Ansys license servers, while licenses issued by LSTC may still use an LSTC license server. Licenses can also be obtained through CMC Microsystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two options for specifying an LSTC license server?",
    "answer": "The two options are creating a `ls-dyna.lic` file in `$HOME/.licenses/` or setting the `LSTC_LICENSE` and `LSTC_LICENSE_SERVER` environment variables in your slurm scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify an LSTC license server using the `ls-dyna.lic` file?",
    "answer": "Create a file named `ls-dyna.lic` in `$HOME/.licenses/` with the contents:\n`#LICENSE_TYPE: network`\n`#LICENSE_SERVER:<port>@<server>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is using the `ls-dyna.lic` file recommended for LSTC license users?",
    "answer": "It is recommended because the identical settings will automatically be used by all jobs submitted on the cluster without needing to specify them in individual slurm scripts or environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify an LSTC license server using environment variables?",
    "answer": "Set `export LSTC_LICENSE=network` and `export LSTC_LICENSE_SERVER=<port>@<server>` in your slurm scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the priority between the `ls-dyna.lic` file and environment variables for LSTC licenses?",
    "answer": "Environment variables (`LSTC_LICENSE` and `LSTC_LICENSE_SERVER`) will take priority over any values specified in the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What must be true about the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file for any `ls-dyna` or `ls-dyna-mpi` module to successfully load when using LSTC environment variables?",
    "answer": "The `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file must exist (even if it's empty)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to ensure the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file exists?",
    "answer": "Run `touch ~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` once on the command line on each cluster where you will submit jobs."
