    "question": "What is a CPU?",
    "answer": "A CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the computer's brain where most calculations are performed, also known as a processor or central processor."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a GPU used for?",
    "answer": "A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is used to accelerate deep learning, analytics, and engineering applications, playing an important role in accelerating applications in AI, automotive, drones, and robotics."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do GPU accelerators operate?",
    "answer": "GPU accelerators power energy-efficient data centers in university laboratories, universities, large corporations, and small and medium-sized businesses worldwide."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a vCPU?",
    "answer": "A vCPU (virtual central processing unit) is a virtual processing unit. In a cloud environment, one or more virtual CPUs are assigned to each virtual machine."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a virtual machine's operating system perceive a vCPU?",
    "answer": "The operating system of a virtual machine considers each virtual CPU as a simple physical processor core."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a vGPU?",
    "answer": "A vGPU (virtual graphics processing unit) is a virtual graphics processor. One or more vGPUs can be assigned to an instance in a cloud environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does an instance's operating system perceive a vGPU?",
    "answer": "The operating system of the instance sees each vGPU as a distinct physical GPU card."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an UGR?",
    "answer": "UGR (Unit\u00e9 GPU de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence) is a unit of measure for the relative utilization of a GPU resource."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the UGR value?",
    "answer": "The UGR value is used to determine the cost of using a particular GPU model, as each model has different performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the UGR value for a GPU A100-40GB?",
    "answer": "A GPU A100-40GB is equivalent to 4.0 UGR."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the UGR value for a GPU V100-16GB?",
    "answer": "A GPU V100-16GB is equivalent to 2.2 UGR."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the UGR value for a GPU P100-12GB?",
    "answer": "A GPU P100-12GB is equivalent to 1.0 UGR."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do resource allocations differ between cloud/storage and CPU/GPU resources?",
    "answer": "Cloud and storage resources are allocated differently from CPU and GPU compute resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are storage resources allocated to a research group?",
    "answer": "A research group obtains a maximum of storage resources for its exclusive consumption during the allocation period."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a research group exceed its allocated vCPU and storage space in a cloud resource allocation?",
    "answer": "No, the allocated quantity of vCPU and storage space cannot be exceeded during the allocation period for cloud resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are allocated CPUs and GPUs assigned as maximum quantities?",
    "answer": "No, allocated CPUs and GPUs are not assigned as maximum quantities, but rather as target quantities whose availability is subject to scheduler prioritization."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does an allocation of 'n' CPU cores mean for a research group?",
    "answer": "An allocation of 'n' CPU cores means that the research group can expect to access this number of CPU cores throughout the allocation period."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to use more CPU or GPU resources than allocated?",
    "answer": "Yes, it remains possible to use more resources provided they are not being used by other groups."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are periods of underutilization for CPU/GPU resources compensated?",
    "answer": "No, periods of underutilization, such as when research activities are slow or hardware is down or under maintenance, are not compensated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a cluster?",
    "answer": "A cluster is a group of interconnected compute nodes managed by a scheduling program."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a compute node?",
    "answer": "A compute node is a computing unit within a cluster, possessing its own operating system image, one or more CPU cores, and RAM."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can tasks use a compute node?",
    "answer": "A compute node can be assigned to a task alone or in a group, and tasks can use it exclusively or shared, depending on the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a core-year?",
    "answer": "A core-year is a measure equivalent to using one CPU core continuously for a full year."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example of what constitutes one core-year of CPU usage.",
    "answer": "Using 12 cores for one month and using 365 cores for a single day both equate to one core-year of usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are compute resources allocated?",
    "answer": "Compute resources are allocated on a core-year basis."
