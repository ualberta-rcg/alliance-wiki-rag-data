    "question": "How can I access Ansys documentation for specific versions like 2023R2 or 2022R2 without needing to log in?",
    "answer": "To access documentation for Ansys versions 2023R2 or 2022R2 without login, you need to connect to gra-vdi.computecanada.ca with tigervnc, close any open Firefox or Ansys Workbench instances, then start Firefox via Applications -> Internet -> Firefox. In a new terminal window, load the required modules (`module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys; runwb2`) to start Workbench. From the Workbench menu, navigate to Help -> ANSYS Workbench Help. Once the Workbench Users' Guide appears, close Workbench. On the documentation page, click 'HOME' (located left of 'API DOCS'), scroll down to select a product, and then use the 'Release Year' pull-down menu to change the version."
