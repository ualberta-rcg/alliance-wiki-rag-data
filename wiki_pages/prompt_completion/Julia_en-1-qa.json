  {
    "question": "What is Julia?",
    "answer": "Julia is a programming language that was designed for performance, ease of use and portability."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is Julia available on the Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "Julia is available as a module on the Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens the first time a package is added to a Julia project?",
    "answer": "The package will be downloaded, installed in `~/.julia`, and precompiled."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the same Julia package be used in multiple projects?",
    "answer": "Yes, the same package can be added to different projects, in which case the data in `~/.julia` will be reused."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Julia projects manage different package versions?",
    "answer": "Different versions of the same package can be added to different projects, and the required package versions will coexist in `~/.julia`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Julia projects compare to Python's virtual environments?",
    "answer": "Compared to Python, Julia projects replace \u201cvirtual environments\u201d while avoiding code duplication."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the behavior of Julia 1.6 and later packages regarding binary dependencies?",
    "answer": "From Julia 1.6 onwards, Julia packages include their binary dependencies, so there is no need to load any software module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What issues might arise with Julia 1.5 and earlier packages that depend on system-provided binaries on clusters?",
    "answer": "With Julia 1.5 and earlier, you may run into problems if a package depends on system-provided binaries, as Julia's attempts to install such dependencies using `yum` or `apt` with `sudo` will not work on clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended best practice for Julia 1.5 and earlier packages requiring system-provided binaries on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "The best practice is to load the appropriate software module first and use the environment variable defined by the module (e.g., `HDF5_DIR`) to extend `Libdl.DL_LOAD_PATH`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to extend `Libdl.DL_LOAD_PATH` for older Julia packages on clusters, even if a system might have the dependency installed?",
    "answer": "Extending `Libdl.DL_LOAD_PATH` works uniformly on all systems and ensures the package manager can find the required libraries, as some systems (like Cedar) may not have them installed system-wide."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is JLD2 and why is it mentioned as an alternative to JLD?",
    "answer": "JLD2 has superseded JLD and is more portable because it no longer relies on a system-installed HDF5 library."
  },
  {
    "question": "What problem can occur when installing Julia packages in `/home` directories on the Narval cluster?",
    "answer": "On the Narval cluster, Julia sometimes crashes with a segmentation fault during the precompilation step when installing packages in `/home` directories due to a bug in the filesystem software."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the temporary solution for installing Julia packages on the Narval cluster to avoid the filesystem bug?",
    "answer": "Until the bug is resolved, you should use an alternate location, such as `/project`, for your Julia \u201cdepot\u201d on Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it advisable to change the default depot path for Julia packages?",
    "answer": "Installing Julia packages in your home directory can create a large number of files, potentially causing you to exceed your home directory quota."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much space and how many files can a single Julia package like Gadfly.jl consume?",
    "answer": "Installing just the `Gadfly.jl` plotting package can result in around 96MB and 37,000 files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user change their Julia \u201cdepot\u201d path to a different location?",
    "answer": "A user can change their Julia depot path by exporting the `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` environment variable, for example, `export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=\"/project/def-bob/alice/julia:$JULIA_DEPOT_PATH\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "If `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` is set, will the `~/.julia` directory still be used for anything?",
    "answer": "Yes, files in `~/.julia` will still be considered, and `~/.julia` will still be used for some files such as your command history."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done with an existing `~/.julia` depot when moving to a new depot location?",
    "answer": "When moving your depot to a different location, it is better to remove your existing `~/.julia` depot first if you have one using `rm -rf $HOME/.julia`."
