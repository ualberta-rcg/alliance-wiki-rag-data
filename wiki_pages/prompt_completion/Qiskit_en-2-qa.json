    "question": "How do you run a quantum circuit simulation with a specified number of measurements?",
    "answer": "You run the simulation using `simulator.run(circuit, shots=1000).result()`, where `1000` is the number of measurements (shots)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you obtain the measurement counts from a Qiskit simulation result?",
    "answer": "The measurement counts can be retrieved from the result object using `result.get_counts()`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example of the output when printing the measurement counts?",
    "answer": "An example output when printing the measurement counts is `{'00': 489, '11': 535}`, indicating the frequency of each state."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you visualize the results of qubit measurements as an histogram?",
    "answer": "You can display an histogram of the results using the command `plot_histogram(counts)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default simulator used in the provided Qiskit example?",
    "answer": "The default simulator used is `AerSimulator`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information does the `AerSimulator` provide?",
    "answer": "The `AerSimulator` provides the final number of qubits after a specified number of measurements."
