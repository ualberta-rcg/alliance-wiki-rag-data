  {
    "question": "How do you exclude files with a specific suffix when creating a tar archive?",
    "answer": "Use the `--exclude=<suffix>` option. For example, `tar -cvf results.tar --exclude=*.dat results/` will create an archive of `results/` but exclude files ending with `.dat`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `tar` option is used to preserve symbolic links during archiving?",
    "answer": "Add the `-h` option to the `tar` command, like `tar -cvhf results.tar results/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the fundamental difference between archiving and compression when using utilities like `tar`, `gzip`, and `bzip2`?",
    "answer": "Archiving, typically with `tar`, gathers multiple files or directories into a single 'tarball', while compression, with utilities such as `gzip` or `bzip2`, reduces the size of a single file or an existing archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you compress a single file using `gzip`?",
    "answer": "Use the `gzip` command followed by the filename, for example, `gzip new.log.dat`. This will create a compressed file named `new.log.dat.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you compress an existing `.tar` archive using `gzip`?",
    "answer": "Execute the `gzip` command with the archive name, for example, `gzip results.tar`. This will result in a compressed file named `results.tar.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to compress a single file using `bzip2`?",
    "answer": "Use the `bzip2` command followed by the filename, for example, `bzip2 new.log.dat`. This will create a compressed file named `new.log.dat.bz2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you compress an existing `.tar` archive using `bzip2`?",
    "answer": "Run `bzip2 results.tar`. This will produce a compressed file named `results.tar.bz2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create a tar archive and compress it with `gzip` simultaneously?",
    "answer": "Use the `-z` option with `tar`, for instance, `tar -cvzf results.tar.gz results/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `tar` command creates an archive and compresses it with `bzip2` at the same time?",
    "answer": "Use the `-j` option with `tar`, for example, `tar -cvjf results.tar.bz2 results/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are common file extensions for `tar` archives compressed with `gzip`?",
    "answer": "Common extensions for `gzip`-compressed `tar` files are `.tar.gz` and `.tgz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are common file extensions for `tar` archives compressed with `bzip2`?",
    "answer": "Common extensions for `bzip2`-compressed `tar` files are `.tar.bz2` and `.tbz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can files be added directly to an already compressed tar archive (e.g., `*.tar.gz` or `*.tar.bz2`)?",
    "answer": "No, it is not possible to add files directly to compressed archives. You must first decompress the archive, add the files to the `.tar` file, and then re-compress it."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract the entire contents of a `.tar` archive?",
    "answer": "Use the `tar` command with the `-xvf` options, for example, `tar -xvf results.tar`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a tar archive to a specific destination directory?",
    "answer": "Use the `-C` option followed by the destination directory path, for example, `tar -xvf results.tar -C new_results/`. Ensure the destination directory exists beforehand."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you display only the names of files extracted from an archive, and how can you get more verbose details?",
    "answer": "The `-v` option displays the names of extracted files. To get more detailed information (like permissions and dates), use the option twice, such as `tar -xvvf results.tar`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to decompress a `.gz` file?",
    "answer": "Use the `gunzip` command followed by the filename, for example, `gunzip new.log.dat.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to decompress a `.bz2` file?",
    "answer": "Use the `bunzip2` command followed by the filename, for example, `bunzip2 new.log.dat.bz2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a gzipped tar archive (`.tar.gz`) to a specified destination directory in a single command?",
    "answer": "You can use `tar -xvzf results.tar.gz -C new_results/` or `tar -C new_results/ -xvzf results.tar.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a `bzip2` compressed tar archive (`.tar.bz2`) to a specified destination directory in one command?",
    "answer": "You can use `tar -xvjf results.tar.bz2 -C new_results/` or `tar -C new_results/ -xvjf results.tar.bz2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the destination directory specified with the `-C` option does not exist when extracting an archive?",
    "answer": "If the destination directory specified with `-C` does not exist, `tar` will fail because it does not create the directory automatically."
  },
  {
    "question": "If the `-C` (destination directory) option is not provided during `tar` extraction, where will the files be extracted?",
    "answer": "If the `-C` option is omitted, the files will be extracted into the current working directory."
