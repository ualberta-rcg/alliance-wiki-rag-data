    "question": "What is the workaround for an 'invalid ELF header' error related to 'libiomp5.so' in TensorFlow?",
    "answer": "To resolve the `invalid ELF header` error for `libiomp5.so`, access the directory mentioned in the error and run `ln -sf $(cat libiomp5.so) libiomp5.so`. This command replaces the erroneous text file with the correct symbolic link."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you control the number of CPUs and threads in TensorFlow 1.x?",
    "answer": "In TensorFlow 1.x, you can control the number of CPUs and threads by setting `device_count`, `intra_op_parallelism_threads`, and `inter_op_parallelism_threads` parameters when instantiating a session, for example: `tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(device_count={'CPU': num_cpus}, intra_op_parallelism_threads=num_intra_threads, inter_op_parallelism_threads=num_inter_threads))`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure threads in TensorFlow 2.x?",
    "answer": "For TensorFlow 2.x, threads can be configured using `tf.config.threading.set_inter_op_parallelism_threads(num_threads)` and `tf.config.threading.set_intra_op_parallelism_threads(num_threads)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to set a CPU count directly in TensorFlow 2.x?",
    "answer": "As of TensorFlow 2.1, there doesn't seem to be a direct way to set a CPU count in TensorFlow 2.x."

  {
    "question": "What is a known performance issue with Keras data augmentation layers in TensorFlow versions after 2.8.3?",
    "answer": "A bug in Keras for TensorFlow versions after 2.8.3 significantly slows down the training process (by more than 100 times) when using data augmentation layers with the prefix `tf.keras.layers.Random` (e.g., `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which TensorFlow version fixes the performance bug affecting Keras data augmentation layers?",
    "answer": "The performance bug affecting Keras data augmentation layers (like `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation`) is fixed in TensorFlow version 2.12."
