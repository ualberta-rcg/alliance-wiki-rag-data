  {
    "question": "How do you configure LS-DYNA to use an Ansys license server?",
    "answer": "You need to set two environment variables in your Slurm scripts: `export LSTC_LICENSE=ansys` and `export ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=<port>@<server>`, replacing `<port>` with an integer and `<server>` with the hostname or IP address of your Ansys license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Ansys LS-DYNA license environment variables be placed in the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file?",
    "answer": "No, these variables cannot be defined in your `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file must be present for an `ls-dyna` module to load when using an Ansys license?",
    "answer": "The `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file must exist, even if it's empty."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command ensures the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file exists for LS-DYNA module loading?",
    "answer": "Run `touch ~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` once from the command line (or each time in your Slurm scripts)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which LS-DYNA module versions are required for compatibility with Ansys license servers?",
    "answer": "Only module versions greater than or equal to 12.2.1 will work with Ansys license servers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a free Ansys LS-DYNA license available on SHARCNET?",
    "answer": "Yes, the SHARCNET Ansys license supports running SMP and MPP LS-DYNA jobs and can be used for free by anyone on a core and job limited basis."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which clusters can the free SHARCNET Ansys license be used?",
    "answer": "It can be used on Graham, Narval, or Cedar clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure a Slurm script to use the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "Add `export LSTC_LICENSE=ansys` and `export ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=1055@license3.sharcnet.ca` to your Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure an LS-DYNA license obtained from CMC Microsystems?",
    "answer": "Set `export LSTC_LICENSE=ansys` and then `export ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE` with the specific IP address for your cluster, such as `6624@10.20.73.21` for Beluga or `6624@10.25.1.56` for Graham."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are firewall changes necessary to use a CMC LS-DYNA license on a cluster?",
    "answer": "No, firewall changes are not required to use a CMC license on any cluster since these have already been done."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can CMC LS-DYNA license variables be defined in the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file?",
    "answer": "No, these variables cannot be defined in your `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file because the remote CMC server that hosts LS-DYNA licenses is Ansys-based."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which LS-DYNA module versions are compatible with CMC license servers?",
    "answer": "Only module versions greater than or equal to 13.1.1 will work with Ansys license servers (which CMC licenses use)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of job execution binaries does LS-DYNA provide?",
    "answer": "LS-DYNA provides binaries for running jobs on a single compute node (SMP - Shared Memory Parallel using OpenMP) or across multiple compute nodes (MPP - Message Passing Parallel using MPI)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one list the available LS-DYNA modules for single compute node jobs?",
    "answer": "Modules for running jobs on a single compute node can be listed with `module spider ls-dyna`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are single-node LS-DYNA jobs submitted to the queue?",
    "answer": "Jobs may be submitted to the queue with `sbatch script-smp.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the `LSTC_MEMORY=AUTO` environment variable in LS-DYNA?",
    "answer": "This setting allows memory to be dynamically extended beyond the specified memory word setting, which is suitable for explicit analysis like metal forming simulations but not crash analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the byte-per-word ratio for single precision and double precision LS-DYNA solvers?",
    "answer": "There are 4 Bytes/word for the single precision solver and 8 Bytes/word for the double precision solver."
  },
  {
    "question": "For implicit LS-DYNA jobs on a single node, what memory allocation is considered ideal?",
    "answer": "12GB is considered ideal for implicit jobs on a single node, representing 75% of the total 16GB reserved for the job."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the total memory setting for Slurm calculated for both implicit and explicit LS-DYNA analyses?",
    "answer": "Once an estimate for the total solver memory in GB is determined, the total memory setting for Slurm can be determined by multiplying by 25%."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you calculate the memory parameter value in mega words for double and single precision LS-DYNA solutions?",
    "answer": "For double precision, it's `(0.75 * memGB / 8Bytes/w) * 1000M`, and for single precision, it's `(0.75 * memGB / 4Bytes/w) * 1000M`."
