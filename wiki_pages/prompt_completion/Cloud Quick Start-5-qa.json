    "question": "What details need to be specified when defining a Windows virtual machine?",
    "answer": "When defining a Windows VM, you need to specify the Instance Name, Flavor, Instance Count, Instance Boot Source (Image), Image Name, Device Size, and decide on the 'Delete on Terminate' option. You also need to check Project Limits."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended flavor for a Windows VM and why?",
    "answer": "The recommended flavor for a Windows VM is 'p2-3gb'. This is because Windows images are large and require a larger bootable drive than C-flavors provide (20 GB root drives). Also, the smallest 'p' flavor with 1.5 GB of RAM is insufficient, so 'p2-3gb' improves performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended root drive size for a Windows VM?",
    "answer": "The recommended root drive size for a Windows VM is 30GB or more, as the final operating system occupies approximately 20 GB, with additional space needed during setup."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the advice regarding the 'Delete on Terminate' option when creating a Windows VM?",
    "answer": "It is generally recommended not to check the 'Delete on Terminate' box, as this allows the volume to be deleted manually if desired and prevents accidental deletion of the volume when the VM is terminated."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which security group should be selected during the VM creation process for a Windows instance?",
    "answer": "You should ensure the 'default' security group is checked under the 'Access & Security' tab."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial steps a Windows VM requires after it first boots?",
    "answer": "After a Windows VM first boots, it requires you to select location, language, and keyboard settings, and agree to the license using the console built into the OpenStack dashboard before it finishes booting."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you access the console of a Windows VM in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "To access the console, go to 'Instances' on the left menu, click on the 'Instance Name' of your Windows VM, then click on the 'Console' tab to display the 'Instance Console'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between a private and a public IP address for a VM?",
    "answer": "A private IP address (e.g., 192.168.X.Y) provides inter-VM networking within the OpenStack project but does not allow outside contact. A public IP address allows outside services and tools to initiate contact with your VM for administrative tasks or serving web content, and can also be pointed to by domain names."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you assign a public IP address to a Windows VM?",
    "answer": "To assign a public IP, select 'Associate Floating IP' from the drop-down menu in the 'Actions' column of the 'Instances' list. If it's your first time, click the '+' sign in the 'Allocate Floating IP' dialog box, then click 'Allocate IP', and finally click 'Associate'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure the firewall to allow Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to a Windows VM?",
    "answer": "Navigate to the 'Security Groups' tab, select 'Access & Security', click 'Manage Rules' on the default row, then click '+Add Rule'. Select 'RDP' from the 'Rules' dropdown, and replace '0.0.0.0/0' in the 'CIDR' text box with your specific IP address followed by '/32'. Finally, click 'Add'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important not to leave the RDP rule open to '0.0.0.0/0' in the firewall settings?",
    "answer": "Leaving RDP open to '0.0.0.0/0' allows anyone to attempt a connection, making your VM susceptible to brute-force attacks. A cloud administrator may revoke access if this security rule is left unfixed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is required to connect to a Windows VM using a Remote Desktop Connection client?",
    "answer": "To connect to a Windows VM, you need to supply its floating (public) IP address, the user name, and the administrative password."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you retrieve the administrative password for a Windows VM?",
    "answer": "Go to 'Instances' on the left menu, and from the dropdown menu next to your instance, select 'Retrieve Password'. In the form, click 'Choose File', browse to and select your private key file (.pem), then click 'Decrypt Password'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of file is needed to decrypt the Windows VM password?",
    "answer": "A private key file with a '.pem' extension, which matches the public key used during VM creation, is needed to decrypt the Windows VM password."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to a Windows VM from a Windows client?",
    "answer": "Use the 'Remote Desktop Connection' tool. Enter the VM's public IP address in the 'Computer' field, the provided username in the 'User name' text box, click 'Connect', and then enter the retrieved password when prompted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What remote desktop client is recommended for connecting to a Windows VM from a Linux machine?",
    "answer": "The Remmina client is recommended for connecting to a Windows VM from a Linux operating system like Ubuntu."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to a Windows VM from a Linux client using Remmina?",
    "answer": "After installing and launching Remmina, click on 'Create a new remote desktop file'. Enter the Windows VM's public IP next to 'Server', the user name next to 'User name', and the retrieved password next to 'Password', then click 'Connect'."
