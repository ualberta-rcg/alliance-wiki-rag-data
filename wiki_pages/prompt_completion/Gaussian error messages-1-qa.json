    "question": "What does a normal termination of a Gaussian job look like?",
    "answer": "A normal termination of Gaussian will include lines such as 'Job cpu time', 'Elapsed time', and 'Normal termination of Gaussian 16 at Tue Nov 14 15:31:56 2017' (with specific timestamps)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What might cause a Gaussian job to terminate abnormally without producing an explicit error message?",
    "answer": "If a job does not end with normal termination lines and no other error message, it usually means the disk quota was exceeded, the job exceeded the time requested from the scheduler (`--time=HH:MM:SS`), the job exceeded the memory requested (`--mem=`), or the job produced too much data that filled up the local disk on the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are common output messages for an 'Erroneous Write' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "Common messages include 'Erroneous write. write 122880 instead of 4239360. fd = 3 writwa writwa: File exists', 'Erroneous write. write -1 instead of 3648000. fd = 4 writwa writwa: No space left on device', or 'Erroneous write during file extend. write -1 instead of 8192 Probably out of disk space. Write error in NtrExt1'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical explanation for an 'Erroneous Write' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error typically occurs when you have run out of disk space, which could be due to exceeding your quota, a physically full disk, or a network drive being unavailable because of a communication time out."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you fix an 'Erroneous Write' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You can fix this error by checking your disk quota with `quota` and deleting unnecessary files, or by trying a smaller basis set if the job is too large for the current hardware."
  },
  {
    "question": "What output indicates a 'Link 9999' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "A 'Link 9999' error is indicated by lines such as 'Error termination request processed by link 9999. Error termination via Lnk1e in /disc30/g98/l9999.exe.' near the end of the output, often preceded by optimization summary lines showing 'NO' for convergence criteria and 'Optimization stopped. -- Number of steps exceeded'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most common cause of a 'Link 9999' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "The most common cause for a 'Link 9999' error is that a geometry optimization has not converged."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a 'Link 9999' error due to a poor initial starting structure be resolved?",
    "answer": "You can provide a better starting structure (e.g., optimize at a lower level of theory first), or if the structure seems to be converging, restart the optimization from the last step using `geom=allcheck` and potentially `opt=CalcFC` in the route line."
  },
  {
    "question": "What options are available to fix a 'Link 9999' error caused by a poor starting force constants matrix (Hessian)?",
    "answer": "To fix this, one can use a better Hessian by carrying out a series of linked jobs using `--Link1--`, or by using `Opt=ReadFC`, `Opt=CalcFC`, or rarely `Opt=CalcAll` if you have a previous job."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the context of a 'Link 9999' error, what does it mean if the forces are converged but the step sizes are not?",
    "answer": "This indicates that the Maximum Force and RMS Force criteria will show 'YES' for converged, but the Maximum Displacement and RMS Displacement criteria will show 'NO' for converged."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some general reasons why geometry optimizations might fail to converge in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "Geometry optimizations usually fail to converge due to a poor initial starting structure, a poor starting force constants matrix (Hessian), or rarely, issues with the coordinate system (e.g., a poorly formulated z-matrix)."
