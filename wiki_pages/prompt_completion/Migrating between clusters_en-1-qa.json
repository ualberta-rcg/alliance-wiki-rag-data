  {
    "question": "Is data mirrored between the clusters' filesystems?",
    "answer": "No, there is no mirroring of data between the clusters; the contents of home, scratch, and project spaces are independent on each cluster."

  {
    "question": "If a group has a special storage allocation on one cluster, will it be available on other clusters?",
    "answer": "No, a special storage allocation, such as $HOME/projects/rrg-jsmith, will normally only be available on that particular cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are globally installed modules consistent across all general purpose clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, the collection of globally installed modules is the same across all of our general purpose clusters, distributed using CVMFS."

  {
    "question": "Do Python virtual environments or R/Perl packages installed on one cluster need to be re-installed on a new cluster?",
    "answer": "Yes, any Python virtual environments or R and Perl packages that you may have installed in your directories on one cluster will need to be re-installed on the new cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I modify my $HOME/.bashrc file on one cluster, will those changes automatically apply to a new cluster?",
    "answer": "No, if you modified your $HOME/.bashrc file on one cluster to customize your environment, you will need to modify the same file on the new cluster you're using."

  {
    "question": "What system is used for job submission across all clusters?",
    "answer": "All of our clusters use Slurm for job submission."
  },
  {
    "question": "What job submission script parameters might vary between clusters?",
    "answer": "The number of CPU cores per node or per GPU and the amount of memory per node or per core may vary significantly, requiring adaptation of your job submission script."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do all compute nodes have direct Internet access?",
    "answer": "On some clusters, compute nodes may not have direct Internet access; it is recommended to check the cluster's specific page for policies."

  {
    "question": "Are special compute allocations, like RRG, available on every cluster?",
    "answer": "No, special compute allocations like RRG or contributed allocations are tied to a particular cluster and will not be available on other clusters, though default research group allocations are available on every cluster."
