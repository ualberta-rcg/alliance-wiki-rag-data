    "question": "What is an example of an ORCA input file provided in the document?",
    "answer": "An example of an ORCA input file is `benzene.inp`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure ORCA efficiently uses all allocated cores?",
    "answer": "To ensure efficient execution and utilization of cores, add the line `%pal nprocs <ncores> end` to your input file, replacing `<ncores>` with the number of cores specified in your job script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file must be deleted before restarting an ORCA calculation?",
    "answer": "You must delete the file `*.hostnames` (e.g., `benzene.hostnames`) before submitting a followup job to restart a calculation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What error might occur if the `*.hostnames` file is not deleted before restarting an ORCA job?",
    "answer": "If you do not delete the `*.hostnames` file, the job is likely to fail with the error message `All nodes which are allocated for this job are already filled.`"
  },
  {
    "question": "Which specific calculations might encounter OpenMPI related fatal errors due to version inconsistency?",
    "answer": "DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD calculations, in particular, might receive unknown OpenMPI related fatal errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a possible cause for OpenMPI related fatal errors in some ORCA calculations?",
    "answer": "Using an older version of OpenMPI (e.g., 3.1.2) than officially recommended (3.1.3 for `orca/4.1.0` and 3.1.4 for `orca/4.2.0`) can cause OpenMPI related fatal errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one temporarily fix the OpenMPI version inconsistency for `orca/4.2.0`?",
    "answer": "To temporarily fix this issue, you can build a custom version of OpenMPI using the commands `module load gcc/7.3.0` followed by `eb OpenMPI-3.1.2-GCC-7.3.0.eb --try-software-version=3.1.4`, and then loading it with `module load openmpi/3.1.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done after building and loading a custom OpenMPI for `orca/4.2.0`?",
    "answer": "After the building is finished and the custom OpenMPI is loaded, one can manually install `orca/4.2.0` binaries from the official forum under the home directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the provided OpenMPI version inconsistency fix permanent?",
    "answer": "No, this is a temporary fix prior to the official upgrade of OpenMPI on the clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done with manually installed ORCA binaries once the official OpenMPI version is updated?",
    "answer": "Remember to delete the manually installed ORCA binaries once the official OpenMPI version is up to date."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can NBO be used with ORCA if it's not available as a separate module?",
    "answer": "NBO can be accessed via the Gaussian modules which are installed on Cedar and Graham."
  },
  {
    "question": "What software access is required to use NBO with ORCA?",
    "answer": "Users interested in using NBO with ORCA should have access to both ORCA and Gaussian."
  },
  {
    "question": "What keyword must be included in the ORCA input file when using NBO?",
    "answer": "The ORCA input file (e.g., `orca_input.inp`) should contain the keyword `NBO`."
