    "question": "What does the error message 'Attempt to redefine unrecognized symbol' signify in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error is an input error that occurs during a `geom=modify` operation when a variable you are trying to replace is not found in the checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you fix the 'Attempt to redefine unrecognized symbol' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you should either specify the correct checkpoint file or ensure that the variable you are attempting to modify actually exists within the checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the cause of the 'Inconsistency #2 in MakNEB' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This is an input error that typically occurs when there has been a change in the point group, and the user has used `iop(2/15=4,2/16=2,2/17=7)` in an attempt to prevent a program crash."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve an 'Inconsistency #2 in MakNEB' error?",
    "answer": "To resolve this error, you should be very cautious when using `iop` directives, or consider removing them altogether from your Gaussian input."
  },
  {
    "question": "What leads to 'malloc failed' or 'galloc: could not allocate memory' errors in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "These errors indicate a memory allocation failure, usually because the computer has run out of memory. This often happens if the `%mem` directive requests too much memory, as Gaussian can use approximately 1GB more than the specified `%mem` value."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the fix for 'malloc failed' or 'galloc: could not allocate memory' errors?",
    "answer": "To fix these memory errors, you should ensure that the value specified for `%mem` in your Gaussian input file is at least 1GB less than the memory requested in your job submission script (`--mem=`). Conversely, the `--mem` value in your job script should be at least 1GB greater than the `%mem` directive."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'PGFIO/stdio: No such file or directory' error mean in a Gaussian job?",
    "answer": "This error means that a specific file (like `/home/johndoe/scratch/Gau-12345.inp` shown in the example) or its containing directory does not exist. It commonly occurs if the `GAUSS_SCRDIR` environment variable points to a directory that doesn't exist."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you resolve a 'No such file or directory' error in a Gaussian job?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you need to either create the missing directory using `mkdir` or change the definition of `GAUSS_SCRDIR` to refer to an existing directory."
