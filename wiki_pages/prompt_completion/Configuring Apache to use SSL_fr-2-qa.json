  },
  {
    "question": "How should the Common Name be specified for a virtual machine on a cloud platform?",
    "answer": "For a virtual machine on a cloud platform, the 'X's in the example Common Name should be replaced by the floating IP address associated with the virtual machine."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to define the owner and permissions for the private key of a self-signed SSL certificate?",
    "answer": "To define the owner and permissions for the private key, use the commands `sudo chown root:ssl-cert /etc/ssl/private/server.key` and `sudo chmod 640 /etc/ssl/private/server.key`."

  },
  {
    "question": "What lines should be replaced in the Apache SSL configuration file (`default-ssl.conf`) to use the new certificate?",
    "answer": "Replace the lines `SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem` and `SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key` with `SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt`, `SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/server.key`, and `SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be checked regarding the DocumentRoot path during Apache SSL configuration?",
    "answer": "Verify that the `DocumentRoot` path in the SSL configuration matches the path defined in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`, provided SSL applies to that specific site."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you strengthen the security of an Apache server using SSL?",
    "answer": "Strengthen security by redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS, requiring more up-to-date SSL versions, and using better encryption options, primarily by modifying the `/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What SSL configuration lines should be added inside the `<VirtualHost>` tag in `default-ssl.conf` to improve security?",
    "answer": "Inside the `<VirtualHost>` tag in `default-ssl.conf`, add `ServerName XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX.cloud.computecanada.ca`, `SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3`, `SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL:!MD5:!SEED:!IDEA:!RC4`, and `SSLHonorCipherOrder on`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When setting the ServerName for a virtual machine in the SSL configuration, how should its IP address be formatted?",
    "answer": "The IP address for the `ServerName` should use hyphens instead of dots, replacing the 'X's in the example."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a permanent HTTP to HTTPS redirection configured for an Apache site?",
    "answer": "To configure a permanent HTTP to HTTPS redirection, modify `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` and add the line `Redirect permanent / https://XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX.cloud.computecanada.ca` inside the `<VirtualHost>` tag."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to enable the secured Apache site and restart the Apache service?",
    "answer": "To enable the secured Apache site and restart the service, use `sudo a2ensite default-ssl.conf` followed by `sudo service apache2 restart`."
