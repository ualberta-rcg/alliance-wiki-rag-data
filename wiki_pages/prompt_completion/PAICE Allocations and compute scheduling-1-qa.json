    "question": "What are the names of the Pan Canadian AI Environment (PAICE) clusters?",
    "answer": "The PAICE clusters consist of Vulcan, Killarney, and TamIA."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do PAICE clusters differ from traditional Alliance methodologies in terms of resource allocation?",
    "answer": "PAICE clusters differ in how resource allocations are assigned, though they borrow strongly from the Alliance's traditional methodologies."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do PAICE sites participate in the Resource Allocation Competition (RAC)?",
    "answer": "No, PAICE sites do not participate in the Resource Allocation Competition (RAC)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do PAICE sites determine cluster computational allocations?",
    "answer": "PAICE sites derive cluster computational allocations by grouping Projects into one of four groups, which are then allocated resources on the three clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many tiers of users are identified for PAICE clusters?",
    "answer": "There are 4 Tiers of users identified for PAICE clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the four identified tiers of users for PAICE clusters?",
    "answer": "The four tiers are: Canada CIFAR AI Chairs and Equivalents and their research teams, AI Institute Faculty Affiliates, Faculty members with a tenure track appointment at a Canadian university within an AI program, and Faculty members with a tenure track appointment at a Canadian university applying AI to other domains."
  },
  {
    "question": "What prefix is used for slurm Account and POSIX groups for users on PAICE clusters?",
    "answer": "Users on PAICE clusters are assigned an AI-specific slurm Account and POSIX group with the prefix of \"aip-\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do the account prefixes on PAICE clusters compare to those on non-PAICE sites?",
    "answer": "PAICE clusters use the \"aip-\" prefix, unlike the more familiar \"rrg-\" or \"rrp-\" prefixes used on non-PAICE sites."
  },
  {
    "question": "When must users utilize the \"aip-\" naming structure on PAICE clusters?",
    "answer": "Users must utilize this naming structure in their job submissions and storage allocations while using the PAICE clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are FairShare values assigned to the tiers on PAICE clusters?",
    "answer": "Each tier is assigned a FairShare value that is proportional to the overall cluster's Shares."
  },
  {
    "question": "What percentage of total shares is allocated to CIFAR AI Chairs on PAICE clusters?",
    "answer": "CIFAR AI Chairs are allocated 45% of the total shares."
  },
  {
    "question": "What percentage of total shares do AI Institute Faculty Affiliates receive on PAICE clusters?",
    "answer": "AI Institute Faculty Affiliates receive 40% of the total shares."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the allocation percentage for faculty members within an AI program on PAICE clusters?",
    "answer": "Faculty members within an AI program are allocated 10% of the total shares."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much of the total shares are allocated to faculty members applying AI to other domains on PAICE clusters?",
    "answer": "Faculty members applying AI to other domains are allocated 5% of the total shares."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a Tier's allocation percentage distributed among projects?",
    "answer": "A Tier's allocation percentage will be further equally divided among the Projects assigned to the Tier."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the divided allocation percentage expressed in the scheduler's Project/Account?",
    "answer": "The divided allocation percentage is expressed as the FairShare value in the scheduler's Project/Account."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the scheduler job priority management on PAICE clusters unique compared to the Alliance's standard methodology?",
    "answer": "Aside from the method of assigning Shares to an Account, the same methodology of scheduler job priority management outlined in the Allocations and compute scheduling document is in effect on the PAICE clusters."
