  {
    "question": "What is GNU gprof?",
    "answer": "GNU gprof is a profiling application that collects information and compiles statistics about your code. It generally identifies functions and subroutines in a program and inserts calculation times for each."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does gprof generate profiling statistics?",
    "answer": "When the program is executed, a raw data file is created. This file is then interpreted by gprof to extract profiling statistics."
  },
  {
    "question": "From where is gprof available?",
    "answer": "gprof is provided with the GNU suite and is available via the <tt>gcc</tt> module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to prepare code for profiling with gprof?",
    "answer": "The first step is to load the appropriate GNU compiler, for example, by using the command 'module load gcc/7.3.0' for GCC."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you compile code to enable gprof profiling?",
    "answer": "You must compile your code with the debugging function activated, which is done by adding the <tt>-pg</tt> option to the compilation command for GNU compilers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the <tt>-pg</tt> option during compilation?",
    "answer": "With the <tt>-pg</tt> option, the compiler generates code to record the information needed for profiling analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What error message might appear if code is not compiled with <tt>-pg</tt>?",
    "answer": "If the code is not compiled with <tt>-pg</tt>, the data for composing a call graph is not collected, and you might see the error message 'gprof: gmon.out file is missing call-graph data'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you execute the compiled code for gprof?",
    "answer": "You execute the code in the same way you would without gprof profiling, using a command like '/path/to/your/executable arg1 arg2'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file is generated after executing a program compiled for gprof?",
    "answer": "After the binary is executed and completes without error, the file <tt>gmon.out</tt> is created in the current directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the <tt>gmon.out</tt> file created?",
    "answer": "The <tt>gmon.out</tt> file is created in the current directory. If the code changes the current directory during execution, <tt>gmon.out</tt> will be created in the new current directory, provided the program has the necessary permissions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you obtain profiling data from the <tt>gmon.out</tt> file?",
    "answer": "To obtain profiling data, execute gprof with the binary name and the <tt>gmon.out</tt> file as arguments, redirecting the output to a text file. For example: 'gprof /path/to/your/executable gmon.out > analysis.txt'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical output file for gprof's profiling information?",
    "answer": "The profiling information is typically saved to a file named <tt>analysis.txt</tt>."
