    "question": "What is classical transpilation?",
    "answer": "Classical transpilation describes the translation of code written in one programming language to code written in another language, a process similar to compilation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the primary goals of transpilation in quantum computing?",
    "answer": "In quantum computing, transpilation aims to ensure that a quantum circuit uses only the native gates of the quantum machine on which it will be executed and that multi-qubit operations are assigned to physically connected qubits on the quantum chip."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of measurement decomposition in quantum transpilation?",
    "answer": "Measurement decomposition addresses measurements made in different bases. If a basis other than the quantum computer's native Z base is required, rotations must be added at the end of the circuit to adjust the measurement base."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which basis do most quantum computers measure?",
    "answer": "Most quantum computers measure in the Z base (computing base)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is intermediate decomposition necessary in a quantum circuit?",
    "answer": "Intermediate decomposition is necessary to limit the number of different operations used by the circuit to run it on a quantum machine. For instance, operations with more than two qubits must be decomposed into operations with two or one qubits."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the objective of the placement step in quantum transpilation?",
    "answer": "The objective of the placement step is to establish an association between the wires of the user-created quantum circuit and the physical qubits of the machine."
  },
  {
    "question": "To what kind of problem can the placement step be reduced?",
    "answer": "The placement step can be reduced to a subgraph isomorphism problem."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are swap operations used during the routing step of quantum transpilation?",
    "answer": "Swap operations are used during routing when two-qubit operations are not properly assigned to physical couplers available on the machine, in order to virtually bring the qubits together and allow them to connect."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a disadvantage of using swap operations in quantum circuit routing?",
    "answer": "Swap operations are very expensive, which makes optimal initial placement essential to minimize their use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is optimization important in quantum transpilation?",
    "answer": "Optimization is important because qubits accumulate errors and lose their coherence over time. The optimization process reduces the number of operations applied to each qubit to limit these effects."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some common techniques used in the optimization step of quantum transpilation?",
    "answer": "Optimization techniques include removing trivial and inverse operations, combining rotations on the same axis, and more generally replacing sections of circuits with equivalent circuits that generate fewer errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of native gate decomposition?",
    "answer": "Native gate decomposition's role is to decompose all non-native circuit operations into the finite set of basic operations (native gates) that a specific quantum computer can perform."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many native gates does the MonarQ quantum computer have?",
    "answer": "MonarQ has a set of 13 native gates."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who developed a transpiler for MonarQ, and what platform is it integrated with?",
    "answer": "Calcul Qu\u00e9bec developed a transpiler for MonarQ, which is integrated into a PennyLane device and designed to be specifically used with PennyLane."
