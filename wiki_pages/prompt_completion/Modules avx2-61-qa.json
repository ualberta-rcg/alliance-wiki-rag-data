    "question": "What is LAMMPS-OMP and what kind of simulations can it perform?",
    "answer": "LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) is a classical molecular dynamics code for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. It has potentials for solid-state materials, soft matter, and coarse-grained or mesoscopic systems, and can model atoms or act as a parallel particle simulator at atomic, meso, or continuum scales. It runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing techniques."
