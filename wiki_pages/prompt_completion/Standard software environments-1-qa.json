  {
    "question": "What are standard software environments?",
    "answer": "Standard software environments are provided through a set of modules that allow users to switch between different versions of software packages. They identify combinations of specific compiler and MPI modules commonly used by the team to build other software."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the software modules organized?",
    "answer": "The modules are organized in a tree structure. The trunk consists of typical utilities provided by any Linux environment, branches represent compiler versions, and sub-branches are versions of MPI or CUDA."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the modules named that group combinations of compiler and MPI modules?",
    "answer": "These combinations are grouped in modules named `StdEnv`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many standard environments existed as of February 2023, and what are their versions?",
    "answer": "As of February 2023, there are four standard environments: 2023, 2020, 2018.3, and 2016.4."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which standard environments are actively supported?",
    "answer": "Only versions 2020 and 2023 are actively supported."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find information about migrating to different standard environments?",
    "answer": "For questions about migration to different standard environments, please see 'Migration to the new standard environment'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which software environment is the most recent iteration?",
    "answer": "`StdEnv/2023` is the most recent iteration of the software environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default components of `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "`StdEnv/2023` uses GCC 12.3.0, Intel 2023.1, and Open MPI 4.1.5 as defaults."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you activate the `StdEnv/2023` environment?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum CPU instruction set supported by `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "The minimum CPU instruction set supported by `StdEnv/2023` is AVX2, or more generally, `x86-64-v3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default compiler in `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "GCC becomes the default compiler in `StdEnv/2023`, instead of Intel."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is CUDA-aware MPI handled in `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "In `StdEnv/2023`, CUDA becomes an add-on to OpenMPI, meaning CUDA-aware MPI is loaded at run time if CUDA is loaded. This allows sharing MPI libraries across CUDA and non-CUDA branches."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were the default version upgrades for core modules in `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "Default versions were upgraded as follows: GCC 9.3 to GCC 12.3, OpenMPI 4.0.3 to OpenMPI 4.1.5, Intel compilers 2020 to 2023, Intel MKL 2020 to Flexiblas 3.3.1 (with MKL 2023 or BLIS 0.9.0), and CUDA 11 to CUDA 12."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the status of the `StdEnv/2020` environment?",
    "answer": "`StdEnv/2020` is deprecated and no longer supported on newer systems, although CPU-only software will still run fine."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did `StdEnv/2020` become the default software environment?",
    "answer": "`StdEnv/2020` became the default software environment in April 2021."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default components of `StdEnv/2020`?",
    "answer": "`StdEnv/2020` uses GCC 9.3.0, Intel 2020.1, and Open MPI 4.0.3 as defaults."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you activate the `StdEnv/2020` environment?",
    "answer": "To activate this environment, use the command `module load StdEnv/2020`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What performance improvements did the Intel compiler bring in `StdEnv/2020`?",
    "answer": "Binaries compiled with the Intel compiler in `StdEnv/2020` automatically support both AVX2 and AVX512 instruction sets, known as multi-architecture or fat binaries."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of 'multi-architecture binaries' for clusters like Cedar and Graham?",
    "answer": "When running on clusters with multiple generations of processors, users do not have to manually load specific `arch` modules if they use software packages generated by the Intel compiler in `StdEnv/2020`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did `StdEnv/2020` simplify module visibility for some software packages?",
    "answer": "Many software packages, previously installed with either GCC or Intel, were installed at a lower level of the software hierarchy, making the same module visible regardless of the loaded compiler. This includes bioinformatics and R modules, which no longer required loading the `gcc` module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What change was made to the compatibility layer for the `StdEnv/2020` release?",
    "answer": "For `StdEnv/2020`, the compatibility layer shifted from using the Nix package manager (used in 2016.4 and 2018.3) to using Gentoo Prefix."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Linux kernel version does `StdEnv/2020` require?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Which CentOS version is no longer supported by `StdEnv/2020` due to kernel requirements?",
    "answer": "`StdEnv/2020` no longer supports CentOS 6, requiring CentOS 7 instead, due to its Linux kernel 3.10 requirement."
  },
  {
    "question": "How were Python extensions handled with the `StdEnv/2020` environment?",
    "answer": "With `StdEnv/2020`, more Python extensions were installed inside their corresponding core modules, such as PyQt5 inside the `qt/5.12.8` module, to support multiple Python versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one find module extensions like PyQt5 in `StdEnv/2020`?",
    "answer": "Running `module spider pyqt5` will indicate that it can be obtained by loading the `qt/5.12.8` module."
