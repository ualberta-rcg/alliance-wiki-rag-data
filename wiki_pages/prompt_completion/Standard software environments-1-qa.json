    "question": "What are standard software environments?",
    "answer": "Our software environments are provided through a set of modules that allow users to switch between different versions of software packages. They are organized in a tree structure with typical Linux utilities forming the trunk, compiler versions as branches, and MPI or CUDA versions as sub-branches."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of StdEnv modules?",
    "answer": "StdEnv modules group common combinations of specific compiler and MPI modules that are frequently used by our team to build other software."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many standard environments are there as of February 2023?",
    "answer": "As of February 2023, there are four standard environments: 2023, 2020, 2018.3, and 2016.4."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which standard environments are actively supported?",
    "answer": "Only versions 2020 and 2023 are actively supported."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most recent standard software environment?",
    "answer": "The most recent standard software environment is StdEnv/2023."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default components for StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "StdEnv/2023 uses GCC 12.3.0, Intel 2023.1, and Open MPI 4.1.5 as defaults."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you activate the StdEnv/2023 environment?",
    "answer": "To activate StdEnv/2023, use the command `module load StdEnv/2023`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum CPU instruction set supported by StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "The minimum CPU instruction set supported by StdEnv/2023 is AVX2, or more generally, x86-64-v3."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default compiler in StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "In StdEnv/2023, GCC becomes the default compiler instead of Intel."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is CUDA integrated with OpenMPI in StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "In StdEnv/2023, CUDA becomes an add-on to OpenMPI, meaning CUDA-aware MPI is loaded at run time if CUDA is loaded, allowing shared MPI libraries across CUDA and non-CUDA branches."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which core modules have been upgraded in StdEnv/2023 compared to previous versions?",
    "answer": "Core modules upgraded in StdEnv/2023 include GCC from 9.3 to 12.3, OpenMPI from 4.0.3 to 4.1.5, Intel compilers from 2020 to 2023, Intel MKL from 2020 to Flexiblas 3.3.1 (with MKL 2023 or BLIS 0.9.0), and CUDA from 11 to 12."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did StdEnv/2020 become the default software environment?",
    "answer": "StdEnv/2020 became the default software environment in April 2021."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default components for StdEnv/2020?",
    "answer": "StdEnv/2020 uses GCC 9.3.0, Intel 2020.1, and Open MPI 4.0.3 as defaults."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you activate the StdEnv/2020 environment?",
    "answer": "To activate StdEnv/2020, use the command `module load StdEnv/2020`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What performance improvement did StdEnv/2020 introduce for Intel-compiled binaries?",
    "answer": "StdEnv/2020 introduced 'multi-architecture binaries' (fat binaries) for Intel-compiled software, automatically supporting both AVX2 and AVX512 instruction sets, removing the need to manually load specific `arch` modules on clusters with diverse processors."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did StdEnv/2020 improve software package visibility?",
    "answer": "Many software packages that were previously installed with either GCC or Intel are now installed at a lower level of the software hierarchy in StdEnv/2020, making the same module visible regardless of which compiler is loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What change was made to the compatibility layer for StdEnv/2020?",
    "answer": "For StdEnv/2020, the compatibility layer switched from using the Nix package manager (used in 2016.4 and 2018.3) to Gentoo Prefix."
