  {
    "question": "What loss function is used in the MXNet example for CIFAR10 classification?",
    "answer": "The `SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss()` is used as the criterion for the model."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the trainer initialized in the MXNet example?",
    "answer": "The trainer is initialized using `Trainer(net.collect_params(),'sgd', {'learning_rate': args.lr})`, indicating an SGD optimizer with a specified learning rate."
  },
  {
    "question": "What transformations are applied to the training data in the MXNet example?",
    "answer": "The training data undergoes a composition of transformations including `transforms.ToTensor()` and `transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which dataset is being used for training in this MXNet example?",
    "answer": "The CIFAR10 dataset is used for training, loaded from the `./data` directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the training data loaded and batched in the MXNet example?",
    "answer": "The training data is loaded using a `DataLoader` with a specified `batch_size`, `shuffle=True`, and a configurable `num_workers`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are inputs and targets moved to the appropriate computing context within the training loop?",
    "answer": "Inputs and targets are moved to the computing context (CPU or GPU) using `inputs.as_in_context(ctx)` and `targets.as_in_context(ctx)` respectively."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the loss calculated and backpropagated in the training loop?",
    "answer": "Inside an `autograd.record()` block, outputs are generated by `net(inputs)`, the loss is calculated with `criterion(outputs, targets)`, and then backpropagated using `loss.backward()`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the trainer update model parameters after backpropagation?",
    "answer": "The trainer updates the model parameters using `trainer.step(batch_size=args.batch_size)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is training performance measured and reported in the MXNet example?",
    "answer": "Performance is measured by calculating the `batch_time` (time taken for a single batch) and then `images_per_sec` (`args.batch_size/batch_time`). These values are appended to a list `perf`, and the mean is printed at the end."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is printed during each training step?",
    "answer": "The current loss is printed for each training step using `print(f\"Current Loss: {loss.mean().asscalar()}\")`."
  }
