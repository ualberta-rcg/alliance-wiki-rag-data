    "question": "What does the GPU graph, specifically the 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' parameter, indicate?",
    "answer": "The 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' parameter indicates the percentage of time during which the GPU executes a warp (a group of consecutive threads) in the last sampling window."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal value for the 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' parameter?",
    "answer": "This value should ideally be around 80%."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is 'SM occupancy' defined, and what is its generally expected value?",
    "answer": "'SM occupancy' is defined as the ratio between the number of warps assigned to an SM and the maximum number of warps an SM can manage; a value around 50% is generally expected."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal expectation for the 'Tensor' parameter in GPU usage?",
    "answer": "The 'Tensor' parameter should be as high as possible, ideally indicating that your code is exploiting this part of the GPU optimized for multi-dimensional matrix multiplications and convolutions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be observed for 'Floating Point' operations (FP64, FP32, FP16) on the GPU graph?",
    "answer": "For 'Floating Point' operations (FP64, FP32, and FP16), you should observe significant activity on only one of these types, depending on the precision used by your code."

  {
    "question": "When might statistics for the entire node's resources be inaccurate?",
    "answer": "Node resource statistics may be inaccurate if the node is shared between multiple users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the left graph illustrate regarding bandwidth used by a task on a node?",
    "answer": "The left graph illustrates the evolution of the bandwidth used by the task over time, in relation to software, licenses, etc."

  {
    "question": "What does the right graph represent concerning network bandwidth usage for a task on a node?",
    "answer": "The right graph represents the evolution of the network bandwidth used by a task or a set of tasks via the Infiniband network over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kinds of events can be observed from the network bandwidth graph for a node?",
    "answer": "Periods of massive data transfer (e.g., reading/writing on a filesystem like Lustre, or MPI communication between nodes) can be observed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the left graph show for local disk operations?",
    "answer": "The left graph illustrates the evolution of the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) performed on the local disk over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the right graph show for local disk bandwidth?",
    "answer": "The right graph shows the evolution of the bandwidth used on the local disk over time, representing the quantity of data read or written per second."
  },
  {
    "question": "What other local disk information is typically provided?",
    "answer": "Information on the 'Use of local disk space' and 'Capacity used' is typically provided."
