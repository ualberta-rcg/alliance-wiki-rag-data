    "question": "How can you connect to an OpenStack instance via SSH after a floating IP has been assigned?",
    "answer": "If a floating IP is present, you can connect via SSH using a command like `ssh centos@X.Y.Z.W hostname`. You might also need to add your computer's IP address to the project's default security group."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the impact of adding a root volume to an existing virtual machine in OpenStack using Terraform?",
    "answer": "Adding a root volume is a destructive operation that replaces the VM's boot disk. It requires careful review of Terraform plans to avoid unintended reconstruction of existing virtual machines."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a root volume defined for an OpenStack virtual machine in a Terraform configuration?",
    "answer": "A root volume is defined as a `block_device` sub-block within the `openstack_compute_instance_v2` resource, alongside the network sub-block."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which attributes are essential when configuring a `block_device` for a root volume in Terraform?",
    "answer": "Essential attributes for a `block_device` include `uuid` (for the image), `source_type` (e.g., 'image'), `destination_type` (e.g., 'volume'), `volume_size`, `boot_index`, and `delete_on_termination`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does setting `destination_type` to `volume` mean in a Terraform `block_device` configuration?",
    "answer": "When `destination_type` is set to `volume`, it indicates that the storage for the block device should be provided by an OpenStack volume rather than using a disk on the hypervisor."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the `delete_on_termination` attribute important for a `block_device` in Terraform, and how should it be set for different use cases?",
    "answer": "For testing, `delete_on_termination` should usually be `true` to automatically clean up volumes. For production use, it should be set to `false` as a safeguard against accidental resource deletion."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the `image_id` attribute is left in the external compute instance definition when a `block_device` is used for a root volume in Terraform?",
    "answer": "Leaving `image_id` in the external compute instance definition will cause Terraform to continuously attempt to rebuild the instance, as it will switch between booting from the volume and booting directly from the image on each execution (likely a provider defect)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the Terraform plan output indicate when a root volume is added to an existing VM?",
    "answer": "The plan output will show `-/+ destroy and then create replacement` for the VM and its associated floating IP, and the summary will indicate actions such as '2 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy'."
  },
  {
    "question": "If you've previously connected to a VM via SSH and it's rebuilt with a new root volume, what action is required?",
    "answer": "You will need to remove the old SSH key from your `known_hosts` file (or equivalent) because the rebuilt VM will be created with a new SSH key."
