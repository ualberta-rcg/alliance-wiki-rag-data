    "question": "What is Salmon (salmonbeta) used for?",
    "answer": "Salmon is a program designed to produce highly accurate, transcript-level quantification estimates from RNA-seq data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Salmon achieve its speed and accuracy?",
    "answer": "Salmon achieves its speed and accuracy through innovations like quasi-mapping (fast proxies for read alignments) and massively-parallel stochastic collapsed variational inference."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of input can Salmon use for transcript abundance estimation?",
    "answer": "Salmon can use raw sequencing reads with its quasi-mapping algorithm, or regular alignments (e.g., unsorted BAM files) with its inference algorithm."
  },
