    "question": "How does block size impact efficiency when handling large files with GNU Parallel?",
    "answer": "Choosing the right block size has a real impact on the efficiency and the number of cores actually used. A block size that is too small results in many jobs dispatched, while one that is too big can lead to inefficient core usage. Often, letting GNU Parallel adapt and decide on the block size is faster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the block size is too small when using GNU Parallel for large files?",
    "answer": "If the block size is too small, it results in many jobs being dispatched over the available cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the block size is too big when using GNU Parallel for large files?",
    "answer": "If the block size is too big, it can lead to underutilization of cores, for example, only using 1 core out of 8, thereby inefficiently processing chunks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is generally the most efficient way to set the block size in GNU Parallel when processing large files?",
    "answer": "In many cases, letting GNU Parallel adapt and decide on the block size (e.g., using `--block -1`) is often the fastest and most efficient approach."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the first steps to plan for running hundreds or thousands of simulations with GNU Parallel?",
    "answer": "First, you must determine how many resources are required by one simulation, then you can estimate the total resources required for your entire job."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long would 1000 serial simulations take if each requires 2 GB of memory, 1 core, and 5 minutes, running on a single core?",
    "answer": "Running 1000 such simulations with 1 core would take 83.3 hours or 3.472 days."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long would 1000 serial simulations take if each requires 2 GB of memory, 1 core, and 5 minutes, running on one node with 32 cores?",
    "answer": "Running 1000 such simulations on one node using 32 cores can be completed in 2.6 hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can GNU Parallel use a file to provide arguments for multiple simulations?",
    "answer": "You can use a file containing all the parameters, where parameters are delimited by a tab character and each line corresponds to one simulation. The command would use `::::` with the file, and potentially `--colsep '\\t'` if parameters are tab-separated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of `--colsep '\\t'` in a GNU Parallel command when using a parameter file?",
    "answer": "The `--colsep '\\t'` option specifies that the parameters within the input file are delimited by a tab character."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can GNU Parallel run simulations from a file that contains a list of commands?",
    "answer": "GNU Parallel can interpret the lines of a file as actual subjobs to be run in parallel by using input redirection (`<`) with the filename, such as `parallel -j $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK < ./my_commands.txt`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can GNU Parallel generate parameters for simulations without needing an external parameter file?",
    "answer": "GNU Parallel can generate the parameters directly and feed them to the command using the `:::` syntax with ranges, for example, `parallel ... my_simulator --alpha {1} --beta {2} ::: {1..10} ::: {1..100}`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some related topics to GNU Parallel mentioned in the document?",
    "answer": "Related topics include META, GLOST, and Job arrays."
