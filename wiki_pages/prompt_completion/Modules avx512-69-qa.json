    "question": "What is Manta used for?",
    "answer": "Manta calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped paired-end sequencing reads. It is optimized for analysis of germline variation in small sets of individuals and somatic variation in tumor/normal sample pairs. Manta discovers, assembles and scores large-scale SVs, medium-sized indels and large insertions within a single efficient workflow."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of Manta is available?",
    "answer": "Manta version 1.6.0 is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is MarginPolish?",
    "answer": "MarginPolish is a graph-based assembly polisher. It iteratively finds multiple probable alignment paths for run-length-encoded reads and uses these to generate a refined sequence. It takes as input a FASTA assembly and an indexed BAM (ONT reads aligned to the assembly), and it produces a polished FASTA assembly."
