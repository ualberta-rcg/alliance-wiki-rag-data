    "question": "What does the `abaqus licensing lmstat -c $LM_LICENSE_FILE -a | egrep \"Users|start|queued\"` command show in the provided example?",
    "answer": "The command shows the total Abaqus licenses issued (78), total licenses in use (53), and specific user job statuses, including licenses in use and licenses queued."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the example, how many Abaqus licenses were issued in total?",
    "answer": "A total of 78 Abaqus licenses were issued."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many Abaqus licenses were actively in use in the example output?",
    "answer": "53 Abaqus licenses were in use."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the example, how many licenses did `roberpj`'s first job on `gra107` acquire?",
    "answer": "`roberpj`'s first job on `gra107` acquired 10 licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why was `roberpj`'s second job on `gra292` queued for licenses in the example?",
    "answer": "`roberpj`'s second job was queued because the user had only 10 Abaqus compute tokens, which were used by the first job, leaving no licenses available for the second job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the suggested methods to avoid Abaqus license shortage problems when submitting multiple jobs?",
    "answer": "To avoid license shortage, users can use a job dependency, a job array, or set up Slurm email notifications to know when a job completes before submitting another one."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to accurately specify memory and CPU resources in a Slurm script for Abaqus tasks?",
    "answer": "It is important to accurately specify memory and CPU resources to ensure optimal utilization of Abaqus tokens and system resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check the memory usage for completed Abaqus jobs?",
    "answer": "For completed jobs, use the command `seff JobNumber` to display the total 'm\u00e9moire utilis\u00e9e' (memory used) and 'efficacit\u00e9 de la m\u00e9moire' (memory efficiency)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What action should be taken if the memory efficiency for a completed job is below approximately 90%?",
    "answer": "If memory efficiency is below approximately 90%, the value of the `#SBATCH --mem=` parameter in your Slurm script should be decreased."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you determine the optimal number of processors for an Abaqus job if CPU efficiency is low?",
    "answer": "If CPU efficiency is below approximately 90%, you should perform scaling tests to determine the optimal number of processors for optimal performance, then update the `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=` value in your Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you monitor the %CPU, %MEM, and RES of a running Abaqus job on a compute node?",
    "answer": "For running jobs, use the command `srun --jobid=29821580 --pty top -d 5 -u $USER` to monitor %CPU, %MEM, and RES for each Abaqus parent process."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the %CPU and %MEM columns in the `top` command indicate for Abaqus processes?",
    "answer": "The %CPU and %MEM columns display the percentage of usage relative to the total available on the node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the RES column in the `top` command represent for Abaqus processes?",
    "answer": "The RES column displays the size of the resident memory per process, in an easily readable format for values greater than 1 GB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the formula for calculating Abaqus tokens based on the number of cores?",
    "answer": "The formula is `TOKENS = floor[5 X CORES^0.422]`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does using a GPU with Abaqus require additional tokens?",
    "answer": "Yes, each GPU requires an additional token."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is eligible to use the Western Abaqus site license?",
    "answer": "The Western site license can only be used by Western researchers on hardware located on the Western campus."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which cluster currently meets the requirements for using the Western Abaqus license?",
    "answer": "Presently, only the Dusky cluster satisfies these conditions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are Graham and gra-vdi excluded from using the Western Abaqus license?",
    "answer": "Graham and gra-vdi are excluded because they are located on the Waterloo campus, not the Western campus."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted for inquiries regarding the Western Abaqus license?",
    "answer": "The administrator of the Western Abaqus license server, jmilner@robarts.ca, should be contacted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information should be provided when inquiring about the Western Abaqus license?",
    "answer": "You will need to provide your username and potentially make arrangements to purchase tokens."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the `abaqus.lic` file be configured to use the Western site license on Dusky?",
    "answer": "The `abaqus.lic` file should contain `prepend_path(\"LM_LICENSE_FILE\",\"27000@license4.sharcnet.ca\")` and `prepend_path(\"ABAQUSLM_LICENSE_FILE\",\"27000@license4.sharcnet.ca\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do if you encounter a problem while using the Western license on Dusky?",
    "answer": "You should write to technical support, indicating that you are using the Western site license on Dusky, and include the problem job number and any error messages."
