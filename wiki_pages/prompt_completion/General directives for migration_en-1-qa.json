    "question": "What is the main purpose of this document page?",
    "answer": "This page explains issues related to transferring your data between our facilities and our regional partners."
  },
  {
    "question": "Whom should I contact if I have doubts about the data transfer advice?",
    "answer": "You should contact our technical support for help."
  },
  {
    "question": "What key responsibility should I clarify before starting a data migration?",
    "answer": "Before migrating, make sure you know whether you are responsible for your own data migration, or whether our staff will be migrating your data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I am new to Globus before a data migration?",
    "answer": "If you haven't used Globus before, read about it and verify that it works on the system you are migrating from."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to test data migration tools like tar, gzip, or zip on test data?",
    "answer": "Testing tools like tar, gzip, or zip on test data ensures you know how they work before using them on important data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much time should I expect a large data transfer to take?",
    "answer": "Expect hundreds of gigabytes to take hours to transfer, and terabytes to take days. It is advised to give yourself days in case there is a problem."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is cleaning up files and directories a good practice before a major data migration?",
    "answer": "Cleaning up files and directories is a good practice because moving less data will take less time, and storage space even on new systems is in great demand and should not be wasted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I delete intermediate files from compiled programs during the cleanup phase?",
    "answer": "You can delete intermediate files by using `make clean`, `make realclean`, or `rm *.o`, depending on your makefile."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are large files named like 'core.12345' usually, and what should I do with them during cleanup?",
    "answer": "Large files named like 'core.12345' are probably core dumps and can be deleted if you don't know what they are."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I efficiently transfer many small files?",
    "answer": "If you have directories or directory trees containing many small files, use tar to combine (archive) them, as most file transfer programs move one reasonable-sized file more efficiently than thousands of small files."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can large files benefit from compression?",
    "answer": "Large files can benefit from compression in some cases, especially text files which can usually be compressed a great deal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does compressing a file solely for transfer always save time?",
    "answer": "No, compressing a file solely for transfer will not necessarily save time; it depends on how much the file can be compressed, how long it takes to compress, and the transfer bandwidth."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tools can be used for archiving and compressing files?",
    "answer": "Tar can be used for archiving files, and tar or gzip can be used for compression."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should I handle duplicated data if migrating from multiple source systems to one new system?",
    "answer": "If you have data duplicated on multiple sources, choose one and only move the duplicate data from that one to avoid moving the same data twice."
  },
  {
    "question": "What caution should be exercised regarding files with duplicate names during migration?",
    "answer": "You should beware of files with duplicate names but different information and ensure that you will not accidentally overwrite one file with another of the same name."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most user-friendly and efficient tool for file transfer recommended during migration?",
    "answer": "If supported at your source site, Globus is the most user-friendly and efficient tool for file transfer, as it is designed to recover from network interruptions automatically."
  },
  {
    "question": "What setting is recommended to enable in Globus during a file transfer?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to enable the setting to 'preserve source file modification times' in the 'Transfer & Timer Options' when using Globus."
  },
  {
    "question": "What practices become more important if Globus is not supported at the source site?",
    "answer": "If Globus is not supported, then compressing data and avoiding duplication becomes even more important."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for migrating data using scp, sftp, or rsync?",
    "answer": "Make a schedule to migrate your data in blocks of a few hundreds of GBs at a time to allow resuming from incomplete files without re-transferring complete ones if the process stops."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I monitor the progress of scp, sftp, or rsync transfers?",
    "answer": "Check regularly to see that the transfer process has not stopped, using file size as a good indicator of progress. If no files have changed size for several minutes, something may have gone wrong."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if an scp, sftp, or rsync transfer stops and restarting it does not work?",
    "answer": "If restarting the transfer does not work, you should contact our technical support."
