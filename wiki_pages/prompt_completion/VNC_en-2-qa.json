    "question": "What are the VDI nodes collectively known as?",
    "answer": "The two dedicated VDI nodes are collectively known as gra-vdi."
  },
  {
    "question": "What capabilities do VDI nodes provide?",
    "answer": "VDI nodes provide a remote desktop environment equipped with accelerated OpenGL, intended for demanding and complex interactive graphical tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which filesystems do the VDI nodes share with Graham?",
    "answer": "The VDI nodes share Graham's /home, /project, and /scratch filesystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does data accessibility work between Graham jobs and VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Any data files or directories created on Graham by running jobs in the queue will immediately be accessible on gra-vdi for visualization and post-processing purposes without the need to transfer them over."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to gra-vdi using a VNC viewer?",
    "answer": "Start the VNC viewer (tigervnc) on your laptop and enter 'VNC server: gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which specific VDI nodes can users connect to directly?",
    "answer": "Users can connect directly to 'gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca' or 'gra-vdi4.sharcnet.ca'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might a user choose to connect to a specific VDI node instead of the general gra-vdi address?",
    "answer": "Connecting to a specific node may be useful if one machine is overloaded or if a user consistently wants to use the local $SCRATCH directory on one server but not the other."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the definition of the local $SCRATCH directory on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "On VDI nodes, the local $SCRATCH directory is defined as /local/tmp/$USER."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the data retention policy for $SCRATCH on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Any data left on $SCRATCH on gra-vdi will eventually be deleted due to limited disk space, and users should not plan to store files there for more than 60 days."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of tasks are VDI nodes primarily intended for?",
    "answer": "VDI nodes are primarily intended for visualization tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should users do if they need to perform long-running computations within a GUI application?",
    "answer": "Users should log out of gra-vdi and instead connect to a compute node on any cluster as described in the 'Compute Nodes' section."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of applications can be run on cluster login nodes via VNC?",
    "answer": "Lightweight applications that do not require much memory, cputime, or a GPU can be run on cluster login nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to a cluster login node via SSH?",
    "answer": "Connect with SSH by running 'ssh graham.alliancecan.ca' from your laptop."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check for and kill old VNC servers running on a login node?",
    "answer": "Run 'vncserver -list' to check for old servers, then use 'pkill Xvnc -u $USER' to kill them."
  },
  {
    "question": "What option should be added when starting a new vncserver on a login node and why?",
    "answer": "The '-idletimeout seconds' option should be added to ensure the vncserver terminates if there are no VNC viewer connections after a specified time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required the first time you start vncserver?",
    "answer": "The first time you start vncserver, you will be required to set a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you determine the port your new vncserver is listening to?",
    "answer": "You can determine the port by examining the log file, for example, by running 'grep -iE \"\\sport|kill\" /home/username/.vnc/gra-login2:2.log'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you set up an SSH tunnel from your desktop to a VNC server on a login node?",
    "answer": "On your desktop, run 'ssh graham.computecanada.ca -L 5901:gra-login2:5903', replacing 5901 and 5903 with your chosen local and server ports, respectively."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Mac or Windows users connect to the forwarded port using TigerVNC Viewer?",
    "answer": "Mac or Windows users should click the TigerVNC Viewer application icon and enter 'localhost:5901' (or your chosen local port) in the 'Connection Details' dialogue box."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the memory and cputime limits on Graham's cluster login nodes?",
    "answer": "On Graham, the limits are 8GB of memory and 1 cpu-hour per process for login nodes."
