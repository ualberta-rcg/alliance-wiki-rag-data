    "question": "What is the `vncserver` command provided by `StdEnv/2023` based on?",
    "answer": "The `vncserver` command provided by `StdEnv/2023` is based on TurboVNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should the `-idletimeout seconds` option be added when starting a new `vncserver` on a login node?",
    "answer": "Adding the `-idletimeout seconds` option ensures that your `vncserver` eventually terminates (once S seconds have elapsed with no VNC viewer connections) if you forget to terminate your vncviewer session by clicking `System -> Log out` in the VNC desktop."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are you required to set a password for your VNC server?",
    "answer": "The first time you start `vncserver`, you will be required to set a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the VNC server password?",
    "answer": "The VNC server password is required to remotely connect to your desktop with a vncclient (such as vncviewer)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you allow multiple connections to the same VNC server?",
    "answer": "Multiple connections to a VNC server are possible if it was started by appending the additional `-alwaysshared` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you determine which TCP port your `vncserver` is listening on from a login node?",
    "answer": "You can determine the port by running `grep -iE \"\\sport|kill\" /home/yourusername/.vnc/l4.nibi.sharcnet:1.log` on the login node, which will show output like 'Listening for VNC connections on TCP port 5901'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you exit the login node after starting your `vncserver`?",
    "answer": "Yes, you may exit the login node, and your `vncserver` will continue running until the time limit assigned by the `-idletimeout` option is reached."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start an SSH tunnel from your desktop to forward a port for a VNC server running on a login node?",
    "answer": "You start an SSH tunnel using a command like `ssh nibi.computecanada.ca -L 5905:l4:5901`, where `5905` is an arbitrary local port, `l4` is the login node, and `5901` is the VNC server's listening port."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to the VNC server using `vncviewer` after setting up an SSH tunnel?",
    "answer": "From the desktop command line, enter `vncviewer localhost:5905`. Mac or Windows users can also click the `TigerVNC Viewer` application icon and enter `localhost:5905` in the 'Connection Details' dialogue box."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations of running VNC servers on cluster login nodes?",
    "answer": "Memory and cputime limits apply on cluster login nodes, making them unsuitable for programs requiring more resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should you start a VNC server on a cluster compute node instead of a login node?",
    "answer": "You should start a VNC server on a cluster compute node if your program requires memory and/or cputime limits greater than those provided on cluster login nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to starting a VNC server on a compute node?",
    "answer": "The first step is to log into a cluster and create a compute node allocation using the `salloc` command, such as `salloc --time=1:00:00 --cpus-per-task=4 --mem=16000 --account=def-piusername`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variable needs to be set on a compute node to avoid repetitive desktop errors before starting a VNC server?",
    "answer": "You should set the environment variable `export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=${SLURM_TMPDIR}` on the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What critical security instruction is given regarding the VNC server password when starting it on a compute node?",
    "answer": "You must set a password for your VNC server and 'DO NOT LEAVE THIS BLANK', otherwise anyone could connect to it and gain access to your account's files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you change your VNC server password after it has been set?",
    "answer": "You may change the password later using the `vncpasswd` command."
