    "question": "What are the dedicated VDI nodes on Graham collectively known as?",
    "answer": "They are collectively known as gra-vdi."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of environment do Graham's VDI nodes provide?",
    "answer": "They provide a remote desktop environment equipped with accelerated OpenGL."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tasks are VDI nodes intended for?",
    "answer": "They are intended for the most demanding and complex interactive graphical tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which filesystems do the VDI nodes share with Graham?",
    "answer": "The VDI nodes share Graham's /home, /project, and /scratch filesystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of shared filesystems on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Any data files or directories created on Graham by running jobs in the queue will immediately be accessible on gra-vdi for visualization and post-processing purposes without the need to transfer them over."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To connect, start VNC viewer (tigervnc) on your laptop and enter 'VNC server: gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca' or 'gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after entering the VNC server address for gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "This will bring up a login screen where you can enter your Alliance credentials."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a desktop session started on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "A desktop session will be started on either gra-vdi3 or gra-vdi4 using a round robin algorithm."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is $SCRATCH defined on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "$SCRATCH on gra-vdi is defined as /local/tmp/$USER."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is $SCRATCH defined on clusters?",
    "answer": "On the clusters, $SCRATCH is defined as /scratch/$USER."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the policy for data stored on $SCRATCH on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Any data left on $SCRATCH on gra-vdi will eventually be deleted since the disc space is limited, and may disappear in 60 days."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is gra-vdi primarily intended for?",
    "answer": "Gra-vdi is a shared resource and intended for visualization tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do if you need to perform long-running computations on a GUI application instead of using gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "You should log out of gra-vdi and connect to a compute node on any cluster, or use the new interactive open on demand infrastructure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should long-running computations not be performed on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Doing so will ensure the memory and CPU resources on gra-vdi are available for others to conduct graphical work without potentially significant continuous performance impacts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of applications can be run in a remote VNC desktop on a cluster login node?",
    "answer": "You may run a lightweight application (one that does not require much memory, cputime or a gpu since login node limits will apply here)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you log in to a cluster login node (e.g., nibi)?",
    "answer": "You must login to a cluster login node by running 'ssh nibi.alliancecan.ca' from your laptop."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check for old unused vncserver(s) running on a login node?",
    "answer": "Run 'vncserver -list'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you kill all old unused vncservers on a login node?",
    "answer": "You can kill them off by running 'pkill Xvnc -u $USER'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start a vncserver on a login node with an idle timeout?",
    "answer": "Start your vncserver on the login node by running 'vncserver -idletimeout 86400'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which VNC software is the vncserver command provided by StdEnv/2023 based on?",
    "answer": "The vncserver command provided by StdEnv/2023 is based on TurboVNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of adding '-idletimeout seconds' when starting a vncserver?",
    "answer": "Doing so will ensure your vncserver eventually terminates (once S seconds has elapsed with no VNC viewer connections) should you forget to terminate your vncviewer session by clicking 'System -> Log out' in the vnc desktop."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required the first time you start vncserver?",
    "answer": "The first time you start vncserver you will be required to set a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the vncserver password required?",
    "answer": "The password will be required to remotely connect to your desktop with a vncclient (such as vncviewer)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What option is needed to allow multiple connections to a vncserver?",
    "answer": "The same password will be required when making multiple connections assuming you started your vncserver by appending the additional '-alwaysshared' option."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you determine the port your vncserver is listening on?",
    "answer": "Determine which port your vncserver is listening on by running 'grep -iE \"\\sport|kill\"' on the log file, for example '/home/yourusername/.vnc/l4.nibi.sharcnet:1.log'."
