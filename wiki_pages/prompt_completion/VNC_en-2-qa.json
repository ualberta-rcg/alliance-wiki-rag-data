    "question": "What is the vncserver command provided by StdEnv/2023 based on?",
    "answer": "The vncserver command provided by StdEnv/2023 is based on TurboVNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should the `-idletimeout seconds` option be added when starting a new vncserver on a login node?",
    "answer": "Adding `-idletimeout seconds` ensures that your vncserver eventually terminates if no VNC viewer connections are made for the specified duration, in case you forget to log out of your vncviewer session."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are you required to set a password for the vncserver?",
    "answer": "The first time you start vncserver, you will be required to set a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the vncserver password be changed later?",
    "answer": "Yes, the vncserver password can be changed later."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the password set for the vncserver?",
    "answer": "The password is required to remotely connect to your desktop with a vncclient (such as vncviewer)."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can the same password be used for multiple VNC connections?",
    "answer": "The same password will be required for multiple connections if you started your vncserver by appending the additional `-alwaysshared` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you determine which port your vncserver is listening on?",
    "answer": "You can determine the listening port by running `grep -iE \"\\sport|kill\" /home/yourusername/.vnc/l4.nibi.sharcnet:1.log` on the login node, which will show output like 'Listening for VNC connections on TCP port 5901'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the vncserver continue running after exiting the login node?",
    "answer": "Yes, the vncserver you started will continue running until the time limit specified with the `-idletimeout` option is reached."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of starting an SSH tunnel on your desktop?",
    "answer": "Starting an SSH tunnel will forward an arbitrary local port (e.g., 5905) to the port your VNC server is listening on remotely (e.g., 5901)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example SSH tunnel command for connecting to a VNC server on `nibi.computecanada.ca`?",
    "answer": "An example SSH tunnel command is `ssh nibi.computecanada.ca -L 5905:l4:5901`, where `5905` is the local port and `5901` is the remote VNC server port on login node `l4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to a remote VNC desktop using the TigerVNC Viewer application icon?",
    "answer": "You click the TigerVNC Viewer application icon and enter `localhost:5905` (or your chosen forwarded port) in the 'VNC viewer: Connection details' popup window dialogue box."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to a remote VNC desktop using the vncviewer command line on your laptop?",
    "answer": "You open a terminal window and run `vncviewer localhost:5905` (or your chosen forwarded port) on the command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after initiating a VNC viewer connection to a remote desktop?",
    "answer": "After initiating the connection, a popup window will appear requesting the VNC authentication password that you previously set up."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations for applications running in a remote desktop on login nodes?",
    "answer": "Applications run in a remote desktop on login nodes are subject to memory and cputime limits."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should a cluster compute node be used for VNC instead of a login node?",
    "answer": "A cluster compute node should be used if your program requires memory and/or cputime limits greater than those provided on a cluster login node, or if you need GPU access for applications or graphics acceleration."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to create a compute node allocation for an interactive job?",
    "answer": "The `salloc` command is used to create a compute node allocation for an interactive job, for example: `salloc --time=1:00:00 --cpus-per-task=4 --mem=16000 --account=def-piusername`."
  },
  {
    "question": "By default, does starting a VNC server on a compute node provide hardware-accelerated OpenGL capabilities?",
    "answer": "No, by default, this approach will not have hardware-accelerated OpenGL capabilities."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the time limit for an `salloc` interactive job?",
    "answer": "A 24-hour time limit applies to `salloc` interactive jobs."
