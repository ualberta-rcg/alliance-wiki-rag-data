    "question": "How do I connect to a cluster login node, such as the nibi cluster?",
    "answer": "You can connect by using the SSH command: `ssh nibi.alliancecan.ca` from your laptop terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check for old VNC servers running on a login node?",
    "answer": "Run the command `vncserver -list` on the login node to check for old unused VNC servers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can I use to kill all old VNC servers running under my user on a login node?",
    "answer": "You can kill them by running `pkill Xvnc -u $USER` on the login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I start a VNC server on a login node with an idle timeout?",
    "answer": "You can start it by running `vncserver -idletimeout 86400` on the login node, replacing 86400 with your desired timeout in seconds."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which VNC software is the `vncserver` command provided by StdEnv/2023 based on?",
    "answer": "The `vncserver` command provided by StdEnv/2023 is based on TurboVNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of adding the `-idletimeout seconds` option when starting a VNC server?",
    "answer": "Adding `-idletimeout seconds` ensures the `vncserver` eventually terminates after the specified idle time if there are no VNC viewer connections, preventing it from running indefinitely if you forget to log out."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens the first time I start a VNC server?",
    "answer": "The first time you start `vncserver`, you will be required to set a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is a password needed for the VNC server?",
    "answer": "The password is required to remotely connect to your desktop with a VNC client, such as vncviewer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the same password used for multiple VNC connections?",
    "answer": "Yes, the same password will be required for multiple connections if the `vncserver` was started with the additional `-alwaysshared` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I find out which port my VNC server is listening on?",
    "answer": "You can determine the port by running `grep -iE \"\\sport|kill\" /home/yourusername/.vnc/l4.nibi.sharcnet:1.log` on the login node, which will show the TCP port (e.g., 5901)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will my VNC server continue running if I exit the login node?",
    "answer": "Yes, if you've set an `-idletimeout` when starting the VNC server, it will continue running until that time limit is reached, even if you exit the login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I set up an SSH tunnel from my desktop to forward a port for my VNC server on a login node?",
    "answer": "On your desktop, use the command `ssh nibi.computecanada.ca -L 5905:l4:5901`, replacing `5905` with your desired local port, `l4` with the login node name, and `5901` with the VNC server's listening port."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I connect to the VNC server using `vncviewer` after setting up an SSH tunnel on my desktop?",
    "answer": "On your desktop command line, enter `vncviewer localhost:5905`, using the local port you forwarded in the SSH tunnel."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Mac or Windows users connect to the VNC server using TigerVNC Viewer?",
    "answer": "Mac or Windows users can click the TigerVNC Viewer application icon on their desktop and enter `localhost:5905` in the \"Connection Details\" dialogue box."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the resource limitations for VNC servers on cluster login nodes?",
    "answer": "Strict memory and cputime limits apply on cluster login nodes for VNC servers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should I start my VNC server if I need more resources than a login node provides?",
    "answer": "If you require more resources, you should start your VNC server on a cluster compute node instead of a login node."
