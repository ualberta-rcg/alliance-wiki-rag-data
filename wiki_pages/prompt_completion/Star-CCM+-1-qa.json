  },
  {
    "question": "Who developed STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "STAR-CCM+ is developed by Siemens."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to provide my own license to use STAR-CCM+ on the servers?",
    "answer": "Yes, you will need to have your own license in order to use this software, as we do not provide licenses, although we are authorized to host the binaries."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can a remote POD license for STAR-CCM+ be purchased?",
    "answer": "A remote POD license can be purchased directly from Siemens."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main types of licenses that can be used for STAR-CCM+?",
    "answer": "A remote POD license purchased directly from Siemens or a local license hosted at your institution can be used, provided it can be accessed through the firewall from the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I configure my account to use a license server with the STAR-CCM+ module?",
    "answer": "To configure your account, create a license file `$HOME/.licenses/starccm.lic` with the layout `SERVER <server> ANY <port> USE_SERVER`, replacing `<server>` with the hostname or IP address and `<port>` with the static vendor port."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it necessary to manually set the `CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE` variable in my Slurm script?",
    "answer": "No, manually setting `CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE` in your Slurm script is not required; when a Star-CCM+ module is loaded, this variable is automatically set to your `$HOME/.licenses/starccm.lic` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variable needs to be manually set for researchers using a POD license?",
    "answer": "Researchers with a POD license must manually set the `LM_PROJECT` environment variable equal to their CD-ADAPCO PROJECT ID in their Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file be configured for a POD license on each cluster?",
    "answer": "The `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file should be configured as `SERVER flex.cd-adapco.com ANY 1999 USE_SERVER`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are required when using an institutional license server for the first time on a cluster?",
    "answer": "After creating your `~/.licenses/starccm.lic` file, you must submit a problem ticket to technical support to coordinate the necessary one-time network firewall changes required to access it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I'm having trouble with STAR-CCM+ licensing?",
    "answer": "If you still have problems getting the licensing to work, try removing or renaming the file `~/.flexlmrc` since previous search paths and/or license server settings may be stored in it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do STAR-CCM+ jobs create temporary files, and how can they be managed?",
    "answer": "Yes, temporary output files from STAR-CCM+ job runs may accumulate in hidden directories named `~/.star-version_number`, consuming valuable quota space. These can be removed by periodically running `rm -ri ~/.starccm*` and replying yes when prompted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are typically loaded for STAR-CCM+ version 20.04.007 on Fir/Rorqual/Nibi clusters?",
    "answer": "You would typically load `StdEnv/2023` and `starccm-mixed/20.04.007` (or `starccm/20.04.007-R8`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the `LM_PROJECT` variable used in a Slurm script for a Siemens Power on Demand (PoD) Key?",
    "answer": "The `LM_PROJECT` variable should be set to your 22-digit PoD Key, for example: `LM_PROJECT='my22digitpodkey'`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary command structure for running STAR-CCM+ with a Siemens PoD license server in a Slurm script on Fir/Rorqual/Nibi?",
    "answer": "The command structure is `starccm+ -jvmargs -Xmx4G -jvmargs -Djava.io.tmpdir=$SLURM_TMPDIR -batch -power -podkey $LM_PROJECT -np $NCORE -nbuserdir $SLURM_TMPDIR -machinefile $SLURM_TMPDIR/machinefile $JAVA_FILE $SIM_FILE -mpi intel -fabric psm2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What MPI implementation is recommended for STAR-CCM+ jobs on the Narval cluster?",
    "answer": "For STAR-CCM+ jobs on the Narval cluster, `openmpi` is specified as the MPI implementation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are license server settings configured directly in the Slurm script for Trillium, bypassing `~/.licenses/starccm.lic`?",
    "answer": "For Trillium, `FLEXPORT=1999`, `VENDPORT=2099`, `LICSERVER=flex.cd-adapco.com` are specified, and then `export CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE=\"$FLEXPORT@127.0.0.1\"` along with an SSH tunnel command: `ssh tri-gw -L $FLEXPORT:$LICSERVER:$FLEXPORT -L $VENDPORT:$LICSERVER:$VENDPORT -N -f`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a retry mechanism implemented in the Trillium Slurm script for STAR-CCM+ license failures?",
    "answer": "Yes, the Trillium Slurm script includes a workaround that attempts to start STAR-CCM+ up to 5 times until the exit status is 0, with a 5-second sleep before subsequent attempts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial steps to prepare an account for remote visualization with STAR-CCM+?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What additional configuration is needed for POD license users preparing for remote visualization?",
    "answer": "Users with a POD license should also set `export LM_PROJECT='CD-ADAPCO PROJECT ID'` and add `-power` to the other command line options."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch STAR-CCM+ 17.02.007 for remote visualization on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "You connect with TigerVNC, open a terminal, load `module load StdEnv/2020` and `module load starccm-mixed/17.02.007` (or `starccm/17.02.007-R8`), then run `starccm+`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific command is used to launch older versions of STAR-CCM+ (13.06.012 or older) for remote visualization on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "For STAR-CCM+ 13.06.012 (or older versions), you run `starccm+ -mesa` after loading the appropriate environment and module."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which `StdEnv` module is required for STAR-CCM+ 18.04.008 or newer versions on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "For STAR-CCM+ 18.04.008 (or newer) on VDI nodes, you need to load `CcEnv StdEnv/2023`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check which STAR-CCM+ versions are available on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "After loading a `StdEnv` module, you may use the `module avail starccm-mixed` command to display which STAR-CCM+ versions are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the MESA implementation of OpenGL used with STAR-CCM+ on `gra-vdi`?",
    "answer": "Currently, only the MESA implementation of OpenGL is usable on `gra-vdi` with STAR-CCM+ due to virtualgl issues that prevent local GPU hardware acceleration for OpenGL driven graphics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to start STAR-CCM+ 18.04.008 (or newer) for remote visualization on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "After loading the required modules (`CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `starccm-mixed/18.04.008` or `starccm/18.04.008-R8`), you should run `starccm+ -rr server`."
