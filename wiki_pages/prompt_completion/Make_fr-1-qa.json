    "question": "What is 'make' software?",
    "answer": "'make' is a software that automatically builds libraries or executable files from basic elements such as source code."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the 'make' command?",
    "answer": "The 'make' command interprets and executes instructions from a 'makefile'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does 'make' differ from a simple script?",
    "answer": "Unlike a simple script, 'make' executes commands only if they are necessary, aiming to achieve a result without necessarily redoing all the steps."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is typically found in a 'makefile'?",
    "answer": "A 'makefile' contains, among other things, information about dependencies."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are dependencies important in a 'makefile'?",
    "answer": "Dependencies ensure that if source files or associated object files change, 'make' only recompiles and reassembles what is necessary, rather than recompiling all files from scratch."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main argument usually provided to the 'make' command?",
    "answer": "The main argument of the 'make' command is generally the target, which is the component that 'make' must build."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some common targets used with the 'make' command?",
    "answer": "Some very common targets include 'all', 'test', 'check', 'clean', and 'install'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if no target is specified when running the 'make' command?",
    "answer": "If no target is specified, the typical behavior is to build everything, which is equivalent to 'make all'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you run tests after compilation using 'make'?",
    "answer": "You can run tests by using commands like 'make all && make check' or 'make all && make test'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'clean' target in 'make'?",
    "answer": "The 'clean' target effaces all previously compiled binary files to resume compilation from zero."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between the 'clean' and 'distclean' targets?",
    "answer": "The 'clean' target effaces files created by 'make', while 'distclean' also removes files created during configuration by tools like 'configure' or 'cmake'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you install an application or library using 'make'?",
    "answer": "The 'install' target normally proceeds with the installation of the compiled application or library."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you specify a custom installation path for 'make install'?",
    "answer": "The installation location can often be modified via an additional 'prefix' parameter, such as 'make install prefix=$HOME/PROGRAM'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are targets like 'all', 'test', 'check', 'clean', 'distclean', and 'install' mandatory for all 'makefiles'?",
    "answer": "No, these targets are only conventions, and the author of a 'makefile' could choose another convention."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find an in-depth guide on creating 'makefile' files?",
    "answer": "For an in-depth guide on creating 'makefile' files, you can visit the GNU Make website."
