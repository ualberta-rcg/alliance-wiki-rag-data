  {
    "question": "What is Ansys Rocky used for?",
    "answer": "Ansys Rocky is a software package for engineering simulation and 3-D design, specifically for fluids, and it can run simulations in both GUI and non-GUI modes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does Ansys Rocky support GPU-accelerated computing?",
    "answer": "Yes, Ansys Rocky supports running simulations with CPUs only or with CPUs and GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which cluster are the provided Ansys Rocky Slurm scripts currently usable?",
    "answer": "The provided sample Slurm scripts for Ansys Rocky are currently only usable on the Graham cluster because the Rocky module is installed there locally."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I view all command-line options for Ansys Rocky?",
    "answer": "To get a full listing of command-line options for Ansys Rocky, you should load a Rocky module (e.g., `ansysrocky/2023R2` on Graham) and then run `Rocky -h` on the command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPUs should be requested for Rocky when solving coupled problems with GPUs?",
    "answer": "If Rocky is being run with GPUs to solve coupled problems, the number of CPUs requested from Slurm on the same node should be increased to a maximum until the scalability limit of the coupled application is reached."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPUs are typically needed for standalone uncoupled problems when running Rocky with GPUs?",
    "answer": "For standalone uncoupled problems when running Rocky with GPUs, only a minimal number of CPUs, such as 2 or possibly 3, should be requested to allow Rocky to run optimally."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are `rocky_hpc` licenses required for Ansys Rocky?",
    "answer": "`rocky_hpc` licenses are required when Ansys Rocky is run with 4 or more CPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the SHARCNET license include `rocky_hpc` licenses?",
    "answer": "Yes, the SHARCNET license does provide `rocky_hpc` licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What module load command is used for a CPU-only Ansys Rocky job on Graham?",
    "answer": "For a CPU-only Ansys Rocky job on Graham, the module load command is `module load ansysrocky/2024R2.0 StdEnv/2023 ansys/2024R2.04`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to run a CPU-only Ansys Rocky simulation in a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The command to run a CPU-only Ansys Rocky simulation in a Slurm script is `Rocky --simulate \u201cmysim.rocky\u201d --resume=1 --ncpus=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --use-gpu=0`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to run a GPU-based Ansys Rocky simulation in a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The command to run a GPU-based Ansys Rocky simulation in a Slurm script is `Rocky --simulate \u201cmysim.rocky\u201d --resume=1 --ncpus=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --use-gpu=1 --gpu-num=$SLURM_GPUS_ON_NODE`."
