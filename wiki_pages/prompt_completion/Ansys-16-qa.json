    "question": "In what modes can Ansys Rocky simulations be run?",
    "answer": "Ansys Rocky can run simulations in GUI mode and non-GUI mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "What processing units does Ansys Rocky support for simulations?",
    "answer": "Ansys Rocky supports running simulations with CPUs only or with both CPUs and GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which cluster are the provided Ansys Rocky Slurm scripts currently usable?",
    "answer": "The provided Ansys Rocky Slurm scripts are currently only usable on the Graham cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are the provided Ansys Rocky scripts currently limited to the Graham cluster?",
    "answer": "The Rocky module, which the scripts load, is currently only installed locally on the Graham cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user view all command-line options for Ansys Rocky?",
    "answer": "To get a full listing of command-line options, run `Rocky -h` on the command line after loading any Rocky module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Rocky module is loaded in the provided `script-rocky-cpu.sh` and `script-rocky-gpu.sh` examples on Graham?",
    "answer": "The provided scripts load `ansysrocky/2024R2.0 StdEnv/2023 ansys/2024R2.04`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of licenses are needed when running Ansys Rocky with 4 or more CPUs?",
    "answer": "When Ansys Rocky is run with 4 or more CPUs, `rocky_hpc` licenses will be required, which the SHARCNET license does provide."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should CPU requests be handled for GPU-based Ansys Rocky simulations involving coupled problems?",
    "answer": "For GPU-based Ansys Rocky simulations solving coupled problems, the number of CPUs requested from Slurm should be increased to a maximum until the scalability limit of the coupled application is reached."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommendation for CPU requests when running GPU-based Ansys Rocky simulations for standalone uncoupled problems?",
    "answer": "For GPU-based Ansys Rocky simulations solving standalone uncoupled problems, only a minimal number of CPUs (e.g., 2 or 3) should be requested for optimal performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to simulate an Ansys Rocky CPU-only job in non-GUI mode, as shown in the example script?",
    "answer": "The command is `Rocky --simulate \u201cmysim.rocky\u201d --resume=1 --ncpus=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --use-gpu=0`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to simulate an Ansys Rocky GPU-based job in non-GUI mode, as shown in the example script?",
    "answer": "The command is `Rocky --simulate \u201cmysim.rocky\u201d --resume=1 --ncpus=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --use-gpu=1 --gpu-num=$SLURM_GPUS_ON_NODE`."
