    "question": "What is the purpose of IDBA-UD software?",
    "answer": "IDBA-UD is an iterative De Bruijn Graph De Novo Assembler for Short Reads Sequencing data, specifically designed to handle data with highly uneven sequencing depth."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does IDBA-UD address errors in low-depth and high-depth regions of sequencing data?",
