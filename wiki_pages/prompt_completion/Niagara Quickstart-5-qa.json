    "question": "What commands can be used to monitor jobs once they are in the queue?",
    "answer": "You can use `squeue` or `sqc` to show the job queue, `qsum` for a summary, `squeue -j JOBID` for specific job information, `squeue --start -j JOBID` for a job run time estimate, `scancel -i JOBID` to cancel a job, `jobperf JOBID` for instantaneous CPU/memory usage, and `sacct` for recent job information."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I view only my own jobs in the queue?",
    "answer": "To view only your jobs, use the command `squeue -u $USER`."

  {
    "question": "Can I get an estimate for when my job will run?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can get an estimate for when a job will run using `squeue --start -j JOBID`, though these predictions are often not very accurate."

    "answer": "To cancel a job, use the command `scancel -i JOBID`."

  {
    "question": "How can I view the instantaneous CPU and memory usage of my running job's nodes?",
    "answer": "You can get an instantaneous view of the CPU and memory usage of the job's nodes while it is running by using `jobperf JOBID`."

  {
    "question": "Which command provides information on your recent jobs?",
    "answer": "The `sacct` command provides information on your recent jobs."
