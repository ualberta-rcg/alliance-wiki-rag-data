  {
    "question": "What are the different ways to boot a VM from a volume?",
    "answer": "You can boot from an image (creating a new volume), boot from a pre-existing volume, or boot from a volume snapshot (creating a new volume)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which VM booting option is available if you haven't booted from a volume before?",
    "answer": "If you have not done this before, booting from an image and creating a new volume is your only option."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are the options to boot from a pre-existing volume or a volume snapshot available?",
    "answer": "These options are only possible if you have already created a bootable volume or a volume snapshot."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do if you want a volume to persist longer than the VM it's attached to when booting from an image?",
    "answer": "Ensure that the 'Delete on Terminate' box is not checked when creating the volume as part of launching the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommendation if you are unsure about the 'Delete on Terminate' option?",
    "answer": "If you are unsure about the 'Delete on Terminate' option, it is better to leave this box unchecked, as you can manually delete the volume later."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary reason for creating an image from a volume?",
    "answer": "Creating an image from a volume allows you to download the image, save it as a backup, or spin up a VM on a different cloud (e.g., with VirtualBox)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if you want to copy a volume to a new volume within the same cloud?",
    "answer": "If you want to copy a volume to a new volume within the same cloud, you should use cloning instead of creating an image."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a prerequisite for creating an image of a volume?",
    "answer": "To create an image of a volume, it must first be detached from a VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the conditions for detaching a boot (root) volume to create an image?",
    "answer": "If it is a boot (root) volume, it can only be detached from a VM if the VM is terminated/deleted, and you must ensure 'Delete Volume on Instance Delete' was not checked when creating the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What consideration should be made for large images (over 10-20GB)?",
    "answer": "Large images may be very slow to create, upload, and manage, so separating data should be considered if possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start the process of creating an image from a volume using the OpenStack dashboard?",
    "answer": "Click on the 'Volumes' left-hand menu, then under the desired volume, click on the 'Actions' drop-down menu and select 'Upload to Image'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which disk format is recommended for images used within OpenStack, and which for VirtualBox?",
    "answer": "QCOW2 is recommended for use within the OpenStack cloud, while VMDK or VDI image formats might be better suited for VirtualBox."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command line instruction to create an image from a volume?",
    "answer": "The command is 'openstack image create --disk-format <format> --volume <volume_name> <image_name>'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended method for copying volumes?",
    "answer": "Cloning is the recommended method for copying volumes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is cloning preferred over creating an image for copying volumes within the same cloud?",
    "answer": "Cloning is much faster and requires less movement of data behind the scenes compared to making an image and then creating a new volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is cloning a volume particularly useful?",
    "answer": "Cloning is handy if you have a persistent VM and want to test something before implementing it on your production site."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is highly recommended before creating a clone of a volume, and why?",
    "answer": "It is highly recommended to shut down your VM before creating a clone because the newly created volume may be left in an inconsistent state if there was writing to the source volume during the clone creation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command line instruction to clone a volume?",
    "answer": "The command is 'openstack volume create --source <source-volume-id> --size <size-of-new-volume> <name-of-new-volume>'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an important consideration before detaching a volume from a VM?",
    "answer": "It is important to ensure that the operating system and other programs running on your VM are not accessing files on the volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you prevent data corruption or unexpected behavior when detaching a volume?",
    "answer": "To avoid corruption or unexpected behavior, you can either shut down the VM before detaching the volume or unmount the volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you find the 'Attached to' information for a volume in the OpenStack dashboard?",
    "answer": "After logging in and selecting the project, go to 'Volumes -> Volumes'; the 'Attached to' column will indicate where the volume is attached."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the procedure for detaching a non-boot volume (e.g., attached to `/dev/vdb`, `/dev/vdc`) using the dashboard?",
    "answer": "In the 'Actions' column drop-down list for the volume, select 'Manage Attachments', then click on the 'Detach Volume' button and confirm by clicking on the next 'Detach Volume' button."
  },
  {
    "question": "What must be done to detach a boot volume attached to `/dev/vda`?",
    "answer": "You must delete the attached VM before the boot volume can be detached, otherwise an 'Unable to detach volume' error will occur."
