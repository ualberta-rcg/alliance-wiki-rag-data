    "answer": "8 processors are specified using `%pal nprocs 8 end`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What keyword ensures ORCA uses all allocated CPU cores efficiently?",
    "answer": "The line `%pal nprocs <ncores> end` should be added to the input file, replacing `<ncores>` with the number of cores specified in the script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file must be removed before restarting an ORCA calculation to prevent it from failing?",
    "answer": "The `*.hostnames` file (e.g., `benzene.hostnames`) must be removed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What error message indicates a problem when restarting an ORCA calculation without removing the `*.hostnames` file?",
    "answer": "The error message `All nodes which are allocated for this job are already filled.` might appear."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances might critical errors occur in ORCA related to OpenMPI versions?",
    "answer": "Critical errors might occur during certain calculations (e.g., DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD) if a less recent OpenMPI version is used than officially recommended for ORCA (e.g., 3.1.2 instead of 3.1.3/3.1.4)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one customize the OpenMPI version for ORCA/4.2.0 as a temporary fix?",
