    "question": "How do you submit a distributed QM/MM task using multiple GPUs?",
    "answer": "An example script named `quick_MPI_job.sh` is provided, which uses `sbatch` directives for 8 tasks, 1 GPU per task, 4000 MB memory per CPU, and a 2-hour time limit. It loads `StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 openmpi/4.1.5 cuda/12.6 ambertools/25.0` and runs `srun sander.quick.cuda.MPI`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the SBATCH parameters for a QM/MM distributed task requesting 8 GPUs?",
    "answer": "The SBATCH parameters are `--ntasks=8`, `--gpus-per-task=1`, `--mem-per-cpu=4000`, and `--time=02:00:00`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are required to run a QM/MM distributed task with multiple GPUs?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the scalability characteristic of MMPBSA tasks?",
    "answer": "The scalability of MMPBSA is linear because each sequence of the trajectory is processed independently."
