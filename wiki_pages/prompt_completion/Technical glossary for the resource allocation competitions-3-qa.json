    "question": "What is dCache?",
    "answer": "dCache is a storage filesystem developed originally for high-energy physics projects for very large datasets (petabytes)."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what kind of datasets was dCache originally designed?",
    "answer": "dCache was originally developed for very large datasets (petabytes) in high-energy physics projects."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is dCache storage fundamentally structured?",
    "answer": "dCache storage is essentially an object file storage layer on top of classical storage providing a single namespace and various authorized access and transfer protocols to the underlying immutable data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is dCache capacity allocated?",
    "answer": "dCache capacity is allocated via the RAC process."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted to use dCache storage?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'local storage' refer to in a compute node?",
    "answer": "Local storage refers to the hard drive or solid-state drive in a compute node that can be used to temporarily store programs, input files, or their results."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can files on local storage on one compute node be accessed by other nodes?",
    "answer": "No, files in local storage on one node cannot be accessed on any other node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should files created on local storage be moved to non-local storage?",
    "answer": "Files created on local storage should be moved to non-local storage to avoid data loss, as local storage may not be persistent."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'Site' in the context of advanced research computing?",
    "answer": "A Site is a member of one of the Alliance's partners providing advanced research computing (ARC) resources such as high-performance computing clusters, Clouds, storage, and/or technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Tape storage technology used for?",
    "answer": "Tape is a storage technology used to store long-term data that are infrequently accessed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the cost of Tape storage compare to disk storage?",
    "answer": "Tape storage is considerably lower in cost than disk."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the equivalent of one Terabyte (TB)?",
    "answer": "One terabyte (abbreviated \u201cTB\u201d) is equal to 1,000 gigabytes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'Alliance Cloud'?",
    "answer": "Alliance Cloud is a pool of hardware supporting virtualization, which can be thought of as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'VCPU year'?",
    "answer": "A VCPU year is the same as a CPU year, but for cloud environments."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'VGPU year'?",
    "answer": "A VGPU year is the same as a GPU year, but for cloud environments."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are 'Compute instances'?",
    "answer": "Compute instances are instances that have a limited life-time and typically have constant high-CPU requirements for their life-time. They have also been referred to as \u2018batch\u2019 instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do compute instances receive higher vCPU/Memory quotas?",
    "answer": "Compute instances receive higher vCPU/Memory quotas because they are time-limited instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are 'Persistent instances'?",
    "answer": "Persistent instances are instances that are meant to run indefinitely (e.g., web servers, database servers) and are generally considered lower CPU or bursty CPU instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do persistent instances have lower vCPU/Memory quotas?",
    "answer": "Persistent instances have lower vCPU/Memory quotas because they are meant to consume resources for long periods of time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'Cloud storage'?",
    "answer": "Persistent cloud storage provides virtual disk functionality to virtual machines running in the cloud."
  },
  {
    "question": "What software makes persistent cloud storage reliable and scalable?",
    "answer": "Persistent cloud storage is made reliable and scalable by specialized software (Ceph)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'Floating IP'?",
    "answer": "A Floating IP is a public IP address that a project can associate with a VM so that the instance has the same public IP address each time that it boots."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an 'Instance' in a cloud context?",
    "answer": "An Instance is a running Virtual Machine (VM), or a VM in a known state such as suspended, that can be used like a hardware server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an 'Ephemeral local disk'?",
    "answer": "Ephemeral local disks use the storage directly attached to a virtualisation host and are not expected to survive if the hardware fails. They are purged and deleted when an instance is itself deleted."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what application use cases are ephemeral disks often used?",
    "answer": "Ephemeral disks are often used in cloud native application use cases where VMs are expected to be short-lived and the data does not need to persist beyond the life of the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'Service Portal'?",
    "answer": "Service Portals are research web portals that serve datasets or tools to a broad research community, generally not requiring large computing or storage resources but potentially needing support from the technical team."
  },
  {
    "question": "What requirements do groups applying for a service portal often have?",
    "answer": "Groups applying for a service portal often use the cloud, generally require a public IP address, and may (or may not) have more stringent up-time requirements than most research projects."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is 'Volume and Snapshot Storage' measured?",
    "answer": "Volume and Snapshot Storage is measured in GB and represents the total size of persistent storage space for all volumes and snapshots."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'Volume Snapshot'?",
    "answer": "A Volume Snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an OpenStack storage volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are Volume Snapshots used for?",
    "answer": "Volume Snapshots are used for backups or as a base to instantiate (launch) other VMs."
