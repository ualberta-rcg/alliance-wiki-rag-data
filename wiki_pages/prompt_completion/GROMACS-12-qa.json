    "question": "What is the purpose of the Colvars software module?",
    "answer": "Colvars is a software module for molecular simulation programs that adds capabilities for collective variables, such as applying biasing potentials, calculating potentials-of-mean-force (PMFs), and using enhanced sampling methods."
  },
  {
    "question": "What enhanced sampling methods are supported by the Colvars module?",
    "answer": "The Colvars module supports enhanced sampling methods including Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF), metadynamics, steered MD, and umbrella sampling."
