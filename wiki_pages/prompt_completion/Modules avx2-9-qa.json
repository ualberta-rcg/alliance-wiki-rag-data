    "question": "What is BEAST used for?",
    "answer": "BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular sequences, entirely oriented towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of BEAST are available?",
    "answer": "BEAST is available in versions 2.6.3 and 2.7.5."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of the BEAST software?",
    "answer": "BEAST can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies and as a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does BEAST handle tree topology in its analysis?",
    "answer": "BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability, rather than conditioning on a single tree topology."
