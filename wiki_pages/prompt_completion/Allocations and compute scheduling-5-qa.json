  },
  {
    "question": "How are SLURM Raw Shares for default accounts determined?",
    "answer": "For default accounts, the SLURM Raw Shares are dynamic over time based on the number of active accounts on the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of plotting the SLURM Raw Shares of a default account?",
    "answer": "Plotting the SLURM Raw Shares of a default account on a specific cluster is an easy way of determining the expected usage that can be achieved by a default account on a given cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is SLURM Raw Usage?",
    "answer": "The SLURM Raw Usage is a metric that the scheduling software uses to determine the priority of accounts, calculated as the cumulative sum of the account's usage in billing units plus a half-life decay period."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is plotting an account's SLURM Raw Usage useful?",
    "answer": "Plotting an account's SLURM Raw Usage is a convenient way to assess how past usage influences the account's priority over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a good rule of thumb for determining if an account's usage is at par with its target share?",
    "answer": "A good rule of thumb is that if the SLURM Raw Usage is at 10 times the SLURM Raw Shares, then the account's usage is at par with its target share."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I select a specific cluster to view my usage data?",
    "answer": "You can select a specific cluster using the 'System' pull-down menu, which contains entries for each active national cluster that uses Slurm as a scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I change the time interval displayed in the usage figure?",
    "answer": "You can change the time interval displayed in the figure using the 'Start date (incl.)' and 'End date (incl.)' fields in the 'Select system and dates' panel."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of jobs are included in the selected time interval for usage display?",
    "answer": "The figure will include all jobs on the specified cluster that were in a running (R) or pending (PD) state during the selected time interval, including both the start and end date."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if I select an end date in the future for displaying usage?",
    "answer": "Selecting an end date in the future will display a 'projection' of currently running and pending jobs for their requested duration into the future, overlaid with a transparent red area labeled 'Projection'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What assumptions are made for jobs in the projection period when displaying future usage?",
    "answer": "In the projection period, each running job is assumed to run to its requested time limit, and each pending job is assumed to start immediately and run until its requested time limit."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the usage projection intended to be a forecast of actual future events?",
    "answer": "No, the projection is not intended to be a forecast of actual future events."
