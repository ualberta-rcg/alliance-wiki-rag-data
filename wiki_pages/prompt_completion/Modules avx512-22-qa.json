    "question": "What is CP2K?",
    "answer": "CP2K is a freely available (GPL) program, written in Fortran 95, designed to perform atomistic and molecular simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular, and biological systems. It supports methods like density functional theory (DFT) using a mixed Gaussian and plane waves approach (GPW), and classical pair and many-body potentials."
