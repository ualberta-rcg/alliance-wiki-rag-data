    "answer": "'miniasm' is available in version 0.3-20191007."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of reads does 'miniasm' process?",
    "answer": "'miniasm' processes noisy long reads, typically from minimap."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'minimac3' designed for?",
    "answer": "'minimac3' is designed to handle very large reference panels in a computationally efficient way for genotype imputation algorithms, without loss of accuracy."

  {
    "question": "Which version of 'minimac3' is listed?",
    "answer": "The listed version for 'minimac3' is 2.0.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the relation between Minimac4 and previous Minimac versions?",
    "answer": "Minimac4 is the latest version in the series of genotype imputation software, preceded by Minimac3 (2015), Minimac2 (2014), minimac (2012) and MaCH (2010)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the advantages of Minimac4?",
    "answer": "Minimac4 offers lower memory usage and improved computational efficiency compared to its predecessors, while maintaining comparable imputation quality."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'minimap2'?",
    "answer": "'minimap2' is a fast sequence mapping and alignment program that can find overlaps between long noisy reads or map long reads/assemblies to a reference genome with optional detailed alignment."

    "question": "What is the expected performance of 'minimap2'?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 works efficiently with query sequences from a few kilobases to ~100 megabases in length at an error rate ~15%, and it is over 20 times faster than most other long-read aligners."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file formats does 'minimap2' support for output?",
    "answer": "'minimap2' outputs in the PAF or the SAM format."
