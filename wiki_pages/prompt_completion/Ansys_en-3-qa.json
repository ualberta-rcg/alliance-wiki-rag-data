  {
    "question": "Where should Ansys Fluent case and data files be transferred on the cluster?",
    "answer": "The case file and, if needed, the data file should be transferred to a directory on the `/project` or `/scratch` filesystem on the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of a journal file in Ansys Fluent?",
    "answer": "A journal file is used to load the case file (and optionally the data file), run the solver, and finally write the results."
  },
  {
    "question": "What parameters need to be adjusted in a journal file?",
    "answer": "You need to adjust the filenames and the desired number of iterations in the journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should I consider modifying my Slurm script to requeue Ansys Fluent jobs?",
    "answer": "You should consider modifying your script to requeue jobs if they frequently fail to start due to license shortages and manual resubmission is not convenient."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum number of times an Ansys Fluent job can be requeued due to license shortages?",
    "answer": "An Ansys Fluent job can be requeued up to 4 times."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a potential risk of using job requeueing for Ansys Fluent simulations?",
    "answer": "A potential risk is that simulations failing due to non-license related issues (such as divergence) will also be requeued, resulting in lost compute time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended to confirm if a requeued job failure is license-related?",
    "answer": "It is strongly recommended to monitor and inspect each Slurm output file to confirm each requeue attempt is license related."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if a requeued Ansys Fluent job fails due to a simulation issue?",
    "answer": "If a job is requeued due to a simulation issue, you should immediately manually kill the job progression with `scancel jobid` and correct the problem."
  },
  {
    "question": "After an Ansys Fluent job runs, how can the data file be imported back into Fluent?",
    "answer": "After running the job, you can download the data file and import it back into Fluent with 'File > Import > Data\u2026'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which type of Slurm script is generally recommended for most Ansys Fluent jobs?",
    "answer": "Most Ansys Fluent jobs should use the 'by node' script to minimize solution latency and maximize performance over as few nodes as possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances might a 'by core' script be preferable for Ansys Fluent jobs?",
    "answer": "Very large jobs might wait less in the queue if they use a 'by core' script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the disadvantages of running large Ansys Fluent jobs with a 'by core' script over many nodes?",
    "answer": "The startup time can be significantly longer, and the jobs will be more vulnerable to crashing if any of the compute nodes fail during the simulation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do the Ansys Fluent Slurm scripts manage memory communication for single-node vs. multi-node execution?",
    "answer": "The scripts ensure Fluent uses shared memory for communication when run on a single node or distributed memory (utilizing MPI and the appropriate HPC interconnect) when run over multiple nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What options are available if Fluent crashes during the initial auto mesh partitioning phase using standard Intel-based scripts?",
    "answer": "The narval tabs (OpenMPI scripts) may offer a more robust alternative, or you can manually perform the mesh partitioning in the Fluent GUI and then rerun the job on the cluster with the Intel scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended cell density per core for optimal efficiency in mesh partitioning for Fluent?",
    "answer": "For optimal efficiency, ensure at least 10,000 cells per core."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the `--nodes` and `--ntasks-per-node` settings for the 'Multinode (by node)' Intel Fluent Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The script specifies `--nodes=1` (with a note that Narval has a 1 node max) and `--ntasks-per-node=32` (max all cores of a compute node)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Ansys Fluent versions are specified in the 'Multinode (by node)' Intel Fluent Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The script specifies `ansys/2023R2` or newer versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment modules are loaded in the 'Multinode (by node)' Intel Fluent Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The script loads `StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2023R2` (or newer versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the possible values for the `MYVERSION` variable in the Fluent Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The `MYVERSION` variable can be `2d`, `2ddp`, `3d`, or `3ddp`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the total number of cores (`NCORES`) calculated in the Fluent Slurm script?",
    "answer": "`NCORES` is calculated as `SLURM_NNODES * SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE * SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`."
