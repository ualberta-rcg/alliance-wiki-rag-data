    "question": "Will commercial, licensed software be transferred to the new systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, the plan is to transition current commercial software licenses to the new replacement systems, aiming for users to have identical access to special applications like Gaussian and AMS/ADF.

  {
    "question": "Will there be periods when multiple systems are offline simultaneously during the transition?",
    "answer": "Yes, despite efforts to limit overlapping outages, constraints from delivery schedules and funding deadlines mean there will likely be periods when several systems are simultaneously offline. Outages will be announced as early as possible."

  {
    "question": "Is it possible to purchase old hardware after the equipment upgrades?",
    "answer": "Most of the retired equipment is the legal property of the hosting institution and is typically e-cycled (recycled) rather than sold. If you are interested in acquiring old hardware, you should contact the host institution directly, as they may have specific policies or options."
