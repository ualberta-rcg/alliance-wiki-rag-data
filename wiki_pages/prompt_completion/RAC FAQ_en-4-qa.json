    "question": "What should I do if I received an RRG allocation last year and am eligible for Fast Track?",
    "answer": "If you are eligible for Fast Track, you can either accept the invitation or decline and submit a new RRG application. You should accept Fast Track if your resource needs will remain the same, knowing allocations are still subject to scaling. If you need more resources (especially compute or cloud), you should submit a new application."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is every application to the RAC accepted?",
    "answer": "No. Due to the imbalance of demand versus available resources, the RAC has increasingly become a more competitive process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the RAC applications evaluated?",
    "answer": "The evaluation criteria for both the RRG and RPP application processes are available in the RAC application guide. Applicants are strongly encouraged to read it carefully."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Resource Platforms and Portals (RPP) application process and how is it different from the Resources for Research Groups (RRG) process?",
    "answer": "The RPP process is for projects primarily providing a service through scientific gateways to improve access to datasets, enhance online tools, or advance collaborations. The RRG process is for projects primarily conducting research requiring compute, storage, and cloud resources to meet their goals. Projects primarily needing compute resources in a cluster for research should apply through the RRG process."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should apply through the RPP process?",
    "answer": "Projects applying through the RPP must provide resources to a larger research community via cloud-based tools, applications, and/or data, and be able to develop, operate, and manage the proposed portal or platform with minimal support from Alliance Federation staff. Applicants are expected to have sufficient experience within their team."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can researchers submit more than one RPP application?",
    "answer": "Yes. An Academic PI may be the lead submitter for one RPP application per competition round and be involved in other RPP applications as a participant. They can only apply as a lead submitter for one RRG application at a time."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I receive a multi-year allocation, do I have to submit a full application every year to renew it?",
    "answer": "No. Research groups that are awarded multi-year allocations are required to submit an annual progress report directly on CCDB, but they do not need to submit a new application each year to renew."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I have a one-year RPP allocation and want to keep it for next year, do I have to submit a new application?",
    "answer": "Yes, a new application is required to maintain a one-year RPP allocation for the following year."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the RPP applications evaluated?",
    "answer": "The evaluation criteria for RPP applications are available in the RAC application guide. Applicants are strongly encouraged to read it carefully."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information do I need to provide in the RPP annual progress report?",
    "answer": "Please visit the RPP Annual Progress Report page for details on what information is required."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the term 'allocation' mean?",
    "answer": "A compute allocation corresponds to a target for use over a period of time, usually a year. For storage, and certain cloud resources, it is a maximum amount. Allocations are usually made in terms of core years, GPU years, or storage space."
  },
  {
    "question": "When will I receive my allocation(s)?",
    "answer": "Generally, all successful allocations are activated in April. The exact starting date will be confirmed in your notification letter."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is my compute allocation guaranteed?",
    "answer": "No. Use of your total allocation cannot be fully guaranteed and is contingent on the availability of our systems. You should receive the full allocation if you run in a reasonably constant manner over the year. If you expect an uneven workload, contact the support team at support@tech.alliancecan.ca."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I use my total allocation and it was not sufficient for my needs, can I get access to more resources?",
    "answer": "PIs can access modest quantities of storage and cloud resources through the Rapid Access Service. Compute resources are also available for opportunistic use without priority. For compute allocations, a fair-share algorithm allocates batch processing priority, which adjusts based on recent usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do existing RAC allocations get priority when future allocations are decided?",
    "answer": "Each annual RAC is handled as a separate application round. Current projects may have an advantage if they can demonstrate usage and success stories, but not an advantage by policy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use the resources without an allocation?",
    "answer": "Yes. Please visit the How to Access ARC Resources page for more details on how to use resources without an allocation."
