    "question": "How do you extract a .tar.bz2 archive to a specific directory in one step?",
    "answer": "To extract a .tar.bz2 archive to a specific destination directory (e.g., `new_results/`) in one step, use the command: `tar -xvjf results.tar.bz2 -C new_results/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an important condition when using the `-C` option for `tar` extraction?",
    "answer": "When using the `-C` option to specify a destination directory, you must ensure that the destination directory already exists, as `tar` will not create it, and the command will fail otherwise."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the `-C` option be placed at the beginning of the `tar` command?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to start the `tar` command with the `-C` option. For example: `tar -C new_results/ -xvjf results.tar.bz2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are files extracted if the `-C` option is not used during `tar` extraction?",
    "answer": "If the `-C` option (destination directory) is not invoked, the files will be extracted into the same directory where the command is executed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you get more detailed output during `tar` extraction, including date and permissions?",
    "answer": "To display more details, such as date and permissions, during `tar` extraction, add an additional `v` option. For example, use `-xvvzf` instead of `-xvzf`, like `tar -C new_results/ -xvvzf results.tar.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a .tar.bz2 archive in two steps?",
    "answer": "To extract a .tar.bz2 archive in two steps, first decompress it using `bunzip2 your_archive.tar.bz2`, which will produce a `.tar` file. Then, extract the `.tar` file using `tar -C ./new_results/ -xvvf results.tar` (adjusting the directory as needed)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a .tar.gz archive in two steps?",
    "answer": "To extract a .tar.gz archive in two steps, first decompress it using `gunzip your_archive.tar.gz`, which will produce a `.tar` file. Then, extract the `.tar` file using `tar -C ./new_results/ -xvvf results.tar` (adjusting the directory as needed)."
