  {
    "question": "What is a serial job?",
    "answer": "A serial job (t\u00e2che s\u00e9quentielle) is a task executed by a single core."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is meant by 'uneven usage' of resources in a batch processing system?",
    "answer": "Uneven usage refers to tasks that are of unequal size, with more or less intense use over time, contrasting with the assumption of regular cluster usage over a determined period."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if they anticipate needing intensive or variable resource usage?",
    "answer": "If you plan to execute intensive, one-off tasks or use your resources variably, you should mention it on your resource allocation request form."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted for issues related to task execution?",
    "answer": "For problems concerning the execution of your tasks, you should contact technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'memory per core'?",
    "answer": "Memory per core (m\u00e9moire par c\u0153ur) is the amount of random-access memory (RAM) per processor core."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example of how 'memory per core' is calculated?",
    "answer": "If a compute node has 2 central units, each with 6 cores, and 24GB of RAM, then the node has 2GB of memory per core."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'memory per node'?",
    "answer": "Memory per node (m\u00e9moire par n\u0153ud) is the total amount of random-access memory (RAM) installed on a compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'base system memory per core'?",
    "answer": "Base system memory per core (m\u00e9moire syst\u00e8me de base, par c\u0153ur) is the system memory capacity in GB requested by a task, divided by the number of CPU cores requested."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'base system memory per GPU'?",
    "answer": "Base system memory per GPU (m\u00e9moire syst\u00e8me de base, par GPU) is the system memory capacity in GB requested by a task, divided by the number of GPUs requested."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a disk in the context of computing?",
    "answer": "A disk is a static semiconductor storage medium for recording programs and data, among other things, for reading and writing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a disk differ from an computer's main memory (RAM)?",
    "answer": "Unlike the computer's main memory or RAM, which are volatile, a disk is a permanent storage medium."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a filesystem?",
    "answer": "A filesystem (syst\u00e8me de fichiers) is a file structure for the systems of a cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What characteristics can a filesystem have?",
    "answer": "A filesystem can have specific characteristics in terms of performance, available space, and usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can all filesystems be used by all nodes in a cluster?",
    "answer": "No, some filesystems can only be used by a cluster's access nodes, while others can serve as storage nodes during task execution."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the /scratch filesystem?",
    "answer": "The /scratch filesystem is visible from compute nodes and serves as high-performance storage used during computational tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of files should be stored on /scratch?",
    "answer": "/scratch is designed primarily for temporary or transient files, raw results of computations and simulations, and any content that can be easily recreated or reproduced."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended practice for using /scratch?",
    "answer": "Data should be copied to /scratch work files and then removed once the task is complete."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are files on the /scratch filesystem managed in terms of purging?",
    "answer": "Files on /scratch are purged according to the local system policy."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are resources on the /scratch filesystem allocated?",
    "answer": "/scratch resources are not allocated competitively, but they offer high quotas."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the /home filesystem typically used for?",
    "answer": "The /home filesystem is generally used for storing personal files, executables, scripts for task execution, and relatively small input datasets."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'home directory'?",
    "answer": "Each user possesses their own /home filesystem, which is called a 'home directory' (r\u00e9pertoire personnel)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics of a home directory?",
    "answer": "A home directory is persistent, smaller than the /scratch work area, usually backed up regularly, and visible to all nodes of the cluster."
