    "question": "How do I connect to VDI nodes for remote visualization of Star-CCM+?",
    "answer": "You need to connect to `gra-vdi` using `TigerVNC` and then log in."
  },
  {
    "question": "After connecting to a VDI node, what are the initial steps to use Star-CCM+?",
    "answer": "Once the remote desktop is displayed, open a terminal window (Applications-->Systems Tools-->Mate Terminal) and specify the version of Star-CCM+ you want to load."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I see available Star-CCM+ versions on a VDI node if `StdEnv` is already loaded?",
    "answer": "You can display the available versions using the command `module avail starccm-mixed`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What OpenGL implementation is currently used with Star-CCM+ on `gra-vdi` and what is the reason?",
    "answer": "Presently, only the MESA implementation of OpenGL can be used on `gra-vdi` with Star-CCM+, due to issues with `virtualgl` which offers local GPU acceleration for OpenGL graphics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the commands to load and launch STAR-CCM+ version 18.04.008 (or newer) on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "First, execute `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023`, then `module load starccm-mixed/18.04.008` (or `starccm/18.04.008-R8`), and finally `starccm+ -rr server`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I launch STAR-CCM+ versions from 15.04.010 up to 18.02.008 on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load `CcEnv StdEnv/2020`, then either `starccm-mixed/15.04.010` or `starccm/15.04.010-R8`, and launch with `starccm+ -mesa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are required to run STAR-CCM+ 13.06.012 (or older versions) on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You should load `CcEnv StdEnv/2016`, followed by `starccm-mixed/13.06.012` (or `starccm/13.06.012-R8`), and then run `starccm+ -mesa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I launch STAR-CCM+ 13.06.012 (or older) on compute nodes for remote visualization?",
    "answer": "You need to load `StdEnv/2016`, then either `module load starccm-mixed/13.06.012` or `starccm/13.06.012-R8`, and finally run `starccm+ -mesa`."
