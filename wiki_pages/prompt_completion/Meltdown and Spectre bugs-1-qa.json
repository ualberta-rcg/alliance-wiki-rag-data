  {
    "question": "Where can I find a detailed discussion about the Meltdown and Spectre bugs?",
    "answer": "A detailed discussion of the two bugs can be found on this page: [https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/meltdown-and-spectre-every-modern-processor-has-unfixable-security-flaws/]."
  },
  {
    "question": "Has Compute Canada patched its systems for Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "Yes, Compute Canada personnel have patched systems deemed sensitive to these vulnerabilities."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was required to patch the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "Updating the operating system and rebooting the nodes was required to patch the vulnerabilities."
  },
  {
    "question": "How were the updates applied to compute nodes?",
    "answer": "For compute nodes, updates were typically done in a rolling fashion, were largely transparent to users, and are now complete."
  },
  {
    "question": "When were updates for these vulnerabilities applied at Graham?",
    "answer": "Updates were applied at Graham between January 5 and January 31, 2018, with most nodes updated by January 13."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of performance impact have the operating system patches for Meltdown and Spectre shown?",
    "answer": "Benchmarks have shown a range of performance impacts, with some figures citing alarming hits of up to 30% or even 50%, while others report very minimal effects."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which types of tasks are most heavily affected by the security patches?",
    "answer": "Tasks which involve a lot of input/output (reading and writing files) seem to be most heavily affected, such as databases or file transfers (e.g. rsync)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are most high performance computing (HPC) jobs affected by these patches?",
    "answer": "Most high performance computing jobs should be minimally affected since the vast majority of the run time is spent computing rather than doing input and output."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which processor generations experience the most performance degradation from the patches?",
    "answer": "The most notable performance degradation has been reported for older processor generations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find links to performance comparisons related to these patches?",
    "answer": "Links to some recent performance comparisons can be found in the References section of the document."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Compute Canada doing about these vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "All vulnerable equipment operated by Compute Canada has been patched, and new vendor patches will be applied as they are released."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Compute Canada's stance on system security for users?",
    "answer": "Compute Canada team members are taking every action possible to ensure that the systems they run are secure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is responsible for updating virtual machines on the Compute Canada cloud?",
    "answer": "If you are operating your own virtual machine in the Compute Canada cloud, you are responsible for updating its operating system to include the latest security patches."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should users do if they believe their application's performance is severely impacted by the security patches?",
    "answer": "Users should contact the Technical support team if they believe their application may be severely impacted by the security patches."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of information should users provide to technical support regarding performance issues?",
    "answer": "Users are encouraged to bring forward comparative performance numbers of their application, such as job run times before and after the announcement."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it always possible to mitigate the performance impact of the security patches?",
    "answer": "No, mitigating the performance impact of the security patches may not always be possible and might require some modification to the code."
  },
  {
    "question": "How often should a virtual machine's operating system be updated on the Compute Canada Cloud?",
    "answer": "A virtual machine's operating system should be updated to the latest version frequently to ensure it has the latest security patches to address these bugs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find specific instructions for updating Linux VMs?",
    "answer": "Specific instructions on how to update Linux VMs can be found by seeing 'updating your VM' in the Security considerations when running a VM section."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find other general information about Spectre and Meltdown?",
    "answer": "Other general information about Spectre and Meltdown is available on the [https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-004A US-CERT web site]."
