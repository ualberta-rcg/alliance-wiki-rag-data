    "answer": "Visual Studio Code is developed by Microsoft."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should Visual Studio Code be used locally?",
    "answer": "VS Code is notable for misbehaving on login nodes, so it is strictly recommended to use it locally whenever possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be avoided when Visual Studio Code is connected to remote systems?",
    "answer": "If Visual Studio Code is connected to remote systems, you should avoid running or debugging your code, as this will execute code on the login nodes, potentially leading to performance issues or system disruptions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended environment for debugging when connected to remote systems with VS Code?",
    "answer": "The `<tt>code-server</tt>` environment is recommended for debugging tasks when Visual Studio Code is connected to remote systems, as it provides a safer and more appropriate context."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary recommendation for using VS Code with remote systems?",
    "answer": "The primary recommendation is to use VS Code locally and avoid connecting it directly to the systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should code changes be transferred to remote systems for testing when using VS Code locally?",
    "answer": "To transfer code changes, save them to your project files with Git locally, and then pull the changes onto the systems when ready to test."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which editors can be used to edit files directly on the systems?",
    "answer": "Terminal-based editors like `nano` or `vim` can be used to edit files directly on the systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What module can be loaded for debugging and quick testing on the systems?",
    "answer": "For debugging and quick testing on the systems, you can load the `<tt>code-server</tt>` module."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it appropriate to configure VS Code for remote connections?",
    "answer": "One can configure VS Code for remote connections if local usage, `nano`/`vim`, or the `code-server` module are not possible for a given scenario."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of using VS Code locally?",
    "answer": "Running VS Code locally offers speed and stability due to fewer network interruptions and faster performance, direct access to files, extensions, and terminals with zero latency, and offline capability, allowing coding without an internet connection or remote server."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you prepare a project for testing on remote systems after local VS Code development?",
    "answer": "After local development, save your changes into a Git repository, push them to a remote host like GitHub or GitLab, then connect to the system and pull your changes to test."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to a system via the terminal after pushing changes to a remote repository?",
    "answer": "After saving and pushing changes, connect to the system via the terminal using the command: `ssh <username>@<hostname>.alliancecan.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you get your project changes onto the system after connecting?",
    "answer": "After connecting, you can clone your repository if it doesn't exist using `git clone git@github.com:username/reponame.git`, or if it exists, change directory to your repository (`cd myrepo`) and pull the changes (`git pull`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can changes be tested on the systems?",
    "answer": "Changes can be tested in a short interactive job with minimal resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are `nano` and `vim` used for regarding file editing on remote systems?",
    "answer": "`nano` and `vim` are terminal-based editors that offer a lightweight and efficient way to edit files directly from the command line on remote systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a graphical alternative for editing files directly on the systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, the JupyterLab text editor provides a versatile graphical alternative, supporting Markdown, Python scripts, and other formats."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one debug or test code on the systems?",
    "answer": "You can debug or test your code on the systems by starting a `<tt>code-server</tt>` instance from JupyterLab."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to launch a `code-server` instance from JupyterLab for debugging?",
    "answer": "To launch a `code-server` instance from JupyterLab, first access one of the options to launch JupyterLab, then select minimal resources and start an interactive JupyterLab job, and finally, on the Launcher tab, click on the VS Code launcher button."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the `code-server` instance have internet access?",
    "answer": "No, the `<tt>code-server</tt>` instance runs in a compute job that does not have internet access."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the `code-server` module include extensions?",
    "answer": "Yes, the `<tt>code-server</tt>` module has several common extensions already available, and more can be added upon request."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should the Remote SSH extension be used for VS Code?",
    "answer": "The Remote SSH extension should be used to configure VS Code to connect to a remote host if other methods for local development, direct file editing, or `code-server` debugging are not suitable for your case."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required for SSH configuration if not already done?",
    "answer": "If not done already, you need to generate your SSH key and add your *public* SSH key on the CCDB for SSH configuration."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should the SSH configuration file be located and what should it contain for remote connections?",
    "answer": "The SSH configuration file should be located at `~/.ssh/config` on your local computer and should contain host configurations like `ServerAliveInterval 30`, `User your_username`, and specific `HostName` entries for remote systems (e.g., rorqual, narval, nibi, fir)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure VS Code locally for remote connections?",
    "answer": "Locally, open the VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`), then open user settings (`Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`), paste or merge the provided JSON configuration, save it, and restart VS Code."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to configure the remote system for VS Code?",
    "answer": "To configure the remote system, first log in via an external terminal (`ssh <username>@<host>.alliancecan.ca`), then create the directory `~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/`, and finally create or merge the `settings.json` file at `~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json` with the specified configuration."

    "answer": "After initiating a remote connection from VS Code, you will be connected to a login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you avoid doing on a login node when connected via VS Code?",
    "answer": "You should absolutely *not* test, debug, or run your code on a login node, as it runs directly on that node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you close a remote VS Code connection?",
    "answer": "To close a remote connection, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`), type 'remote', select 'Remote-SSH: Kill VS Code Server on Host...', choose the host, confirm, and then open the File menu and select 'Close Remote Connection'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you connect to an interactive compute node using VS Code in advanced scenarios?",
    "answer": "For advanced usage, update your local `~/.ssh/config` file to add `ProxyJump` configurations for specific compute nodes (e.g., 'nc*', 'ng*', 'nl*' for Narval; 'rc*', 'rg*', 'rl*' for Rorqual) with your username, then follow the steps to start an interactive job and connect VS Code."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial steps to connect to an interactive compute node from VS Code for advanced usage?",
    "answer": "In an external terminal connected to the system via SSH, start a new interactive job using `salloc` with at least 2000M of memory, and note the allocated compute node name. Optionally, save `SLURM_*` environment variables to a `slurm_var.sh` file."
