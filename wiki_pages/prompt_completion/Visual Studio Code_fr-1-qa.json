  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it necessary to copy the public SSH key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote server?",
    "answer": "This is necessary because the connection nodes do not have access to the public keys entered into CCDB."

  },
  {
    "question": "What must be installed before connecting remotely to a compute node via VS Code?",
    "answer": "Visual Studio Code Server must first be installed before connecting remotely to a compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it necessary to install Visual Studio Code Server on a connection node first?",
    "answer": "It is necessary to install Visual Studio Code Server on a connection node first because some clusters do not allow internet access via compute nodes."
