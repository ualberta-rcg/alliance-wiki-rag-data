  {
    "question": "How is the `train_loader` initialized in the provided code?",
    "answer": "The `train_loader` is initialized using `DataLoader` with `dataset_train`, `batch_size=args.batch_size`, `shuffle=True`, and `num_workers=args.num_workers`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is performance tracked during the training loop?",
    "answer": "Performance is tracked by calculating `images_per_sec` for each batch and appending it to a list named `perf`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step performed with `inputs` and `targets` inside the training loop?",
    "answer": "`inputs` and `targets` are moved to the specified context (`ctx`) using `as_in_context(ctx)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What block is used to enable automatic differentiation?",
    "answer": "The `with autograd.record():` block is used to record operations for automatic differentiation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the model's outputs generated?",
    "answer": "The model's outputs are generated by passing the `inputs` to the `net` object (`outputs = net(inputs)`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the loss calculated for a given batch?",
    "answer": "The loss is calculated by applying the `criterion` to the `outputs` and `targets` (`loss = criterion(outputs, targets)`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What method is called to perform the backward pass and compute gradients?",
    "answer": "`loss.backward()` is called to perform the backward pass."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the model's parameters updated after the backward pass?",
    "answer": "The `trainer.step(batch_size=args.batch_size)` method is called to update the model's parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the time taken for a single batch calculated?",
    "answer": "`batch_time` is calculated as the difference between the current time (`time.time()`) and the `start` time recorded at the beginning of the batch processing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is `images_per_sec` determined for each batch?",
    "answer": "`images_per_sec` is determined by dividing `args.batch_size` by `batch_time`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the current loss displayed during the training loop?",
    "answer": "The current loss is displayed using an f-string: `print(f\"Current Loss: {loss.mean().asscalar()}\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the overall performance, in terms of images processed per second, reported at the end?",
    "answer": "The overall performance is reported by printing the mean of the `perf` list: `print(f\"Images processed per second: {np.mean(perf)}\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `if __name__=='__main__':` block in this script?",
    "answer": "The `if __name__=='__main__':` block ensures that the `main()` function is called only when the script is executed directly."
