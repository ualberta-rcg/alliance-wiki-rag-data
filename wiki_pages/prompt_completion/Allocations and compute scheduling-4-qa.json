  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between 'Total' and 'Running total' summation options?",
    "answer": "If you select 'Total', each bar represents the total usage in that one day. If you select 'Running total', each bar represents the sum of that day's usage and all previous days back to the beginning of the time interval."
  },
  {
