    "question": "What does NVTOP stand for?",
    "answer": "NVTOP stands for Neat Videocard TOP."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is NVTOP?",
    "answer": "NVTOP is a (h)top like task monitor for GPUs and accelerators."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information can NVTOP display about GPUs?",
    "answer": "NVTOP can show GPU usage and its memory, and print information in a htop-familiar way."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can NVTOP monitor multiple GPUs?",
    "answer": "Yes, NVTOP can handle multiple GPUs and monitor single or multiple GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you select a specific GPU device in NVTOP?",
    "answer": "You can select a specific device from the menu by pressing F2 and then choosing 'GPU Select'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary utility of NVTOP?",
    "answer": "NVTOP is useful to monitor and verify that your job is using the GPU as efficiently as possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you monitor a non-interactive (batch) job's GPU usage with NVTOP?",
    "answer": "First, from a login node, find the job id using 'sq'. Then, attach to the running job with 'srun --pty --jobid JOBID nvtop'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to find a job ID for monitoring a batch job?",
    "answer": "The 'sq' command is used to find the job ID."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you monitor an interactive job's GPU usage with NVTOP?",
    "answer": "Start your interactive job, then in a second terminal, connect to the login node, find the job ID using 'sq', and finally attach to the running job using 'srun --pty --jobid JOBID nvtop'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a benefit of monitoring an interactive job with NVTOP?",
    "answer": "You'll be able to see the GPU usage in real time as you run your commands in the first terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it useful to monitor a GPU on a specific node?",
    "answer": "When running multi-nodes jobs, it can be useful to verify that one or all GPUs are effectively used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to monitor a GPU on a specific node for a multi-node job?",
    "answer": "From a login node, find the job id using 'sq' and identify node names using 'srun --jobid JOBID -n1 -c1 scontrol show hostname'. Then, attach to the specific node with 'srun --pty --jobid JOBID --nodelist NODENAME nvtop'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command helps identify node names for a multi-node job you want to monitor with NVTOP?",
    "answer": "The command 'srun --jobid JOBID -n1 -c1 scontrol show hostname' is used to identify node names."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command attaches NVTOP to a job running on a specific node?",
    "answer": "The command 'srun --pty --jobid JOBID --nodelist NODENAME nvtop' is used to attach NVTOP to a job running on a specific node."
