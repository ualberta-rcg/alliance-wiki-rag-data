    "question": "What is symbolic algebra software?",
    "answer": "Symbolic algebra software is a program, often an interactive environment, that works directly with symbolic expressions (like derivatives and integrals) and allows for exact arithmetic and other formal operations in fields such as number theory, group theory, differential geometry, and commutative algebra."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can symbolic algebra software handle approximate numerical calculations?",
    "answer": "Yes, most symbolic algebra programs also permit the use of approximate numerical calculations using floating-point numbers for problems that are analytically intractable."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which commercial symbolic algebra software packages are mentioned?",
    "answer": "The commercial products mentioned are Mathematica and Maple."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are Mathematica and Maple available on the clusters?",
    "answer": "No, neither Mathematica nor Maple is available on the clusters, though users can install them in their home directory if their license permits."
  },
  {
    "question": "What open-source symbolic algebra software is an alternative to commercial products and available on the clusters?",
    "answer": "SageMath is an open-source alternative that can be used on the clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the SageMath module?",
    "answer": "You can load the SageMath module using the command `module load sagemath/9.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run SageMath interactively after loading the module?",
    "answer": "You can run SageMath interactively by typing `sage`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of SageMath is shown in the example output?",
    "answer": "The example output shows SageMath version 9.3, released on 2021-05-09."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Python version does SageMath 9.3 use, according to the example?",
    "answer": "SageMath 9.3 uses Python 3.8.10."
  },
  {
    "question": "What other open-source symbolic algebra software is available on the clusters as modules?",
    "answer": "Additional open-source software available on the clusters includes the Number Theory Library (NTL), SINGULAR, Macaulay2, and PARI/GP."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the module names for Number Theory Library (NTL), SINGULAR, Macaulay2, and PARI/GP?",
    "answer": "The module names are `ntl` for Number Theory Library, `singular` for SINGULAR, `m2` for Macaulay2, and `pari-gp` for PARI/GP."
