  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to select a specific node type for tasks on Graham?",
    "answer": "No, it is recommended not to select a particular node type, as performance differences between Broadwell, Skylake, or Cascade Lake nodes are minimal compared to waiting times."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user specify a Cascade Lake CPU for a task on Graham?",
    "answer": "To specify a Cascade Lake CPU for a task, users should use `--constraint=cascade`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for local storage on a node for tasks?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to use the temporary directory `$SLURM_TMPDIR` generated by Slurm for local storage on a node."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the content of the `$SLURM_TMPDIR` directory deleted?",
    "answer": "The content of the `$SLURM_TMPDIR` directory is deleted at the end of the task execution."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might the amount of available memory on Graham nodes be less than the hardware's rounded value?",
    "answer": "The amount of available memory is less than the rounded hardware configuration because a certain amount is permanently used by the kernel and the operating system."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why will the scheduler not allocate a task if its memory requirements exceed the available amount?",
    "answer": "The scheduler will not allocate a task whose requirements exceed the available memory to avoid time loss due to swapping or paging."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be considered when allocating memory for tasks with many I/O operations?",
    "answer": "When tasks involve numerous read/write operations performed by the kernel and file system, it is preferable to request more memory than the total amount required by the processes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three generations of Tesla GPUs available on Graham, from oldest to newest?",
    "answer": "The three generations of Tesla GPUs available are V100 Volta, GPU Turing T4, and A100 Ampere."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are P100 GPUs still in service on Graham?",
    "answer": "No, P100 GPUs are no longer in service."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do V100 GPUs compare to P100 GPUs in terms of performance?",
    "answer": "V100 GPUs offer twice the performance for standard calculations and eight times the performance for deep learning calculations using their Tensor cores, compared to P100s."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics of the T4 GPU card on Graham?",
    "answer": "The T4 card is adapted for deep learning tasks, is not efficient for double-precision calculations but performs well in single-precision, has Tensor cores, and can process reduced-precision integer calculations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are Pascal GPU nodes still available on Graham?",
    "answer": "No, Pascal GPU nodes are no longer in service."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many Volta GPU nodes does Graham have, and what is a key feature of their interconnection?",
    "answer": "Graham has two Volta GPU nodes in total, which have a high-bandwidth NVLINK interconnection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum execution duration for Volta GPU nodes?",
    "answer": "Volta GPU nodes are available to all users for a maximum execution duration of 7 days."
  },
  {
    "question": "What CPU to GPU ratio is recommended for Volta nodes with 28 cores?",
    "answer": "A CPU/GPU ratio of 3.5 or less is recommended for Volta nodes with 28 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPU cores should be requested for a task using 4 GPUs on a 28-core Volta node?",
    "answer": "For a task using 4 GPUs on a 28-core Volta node, you should request at most 14 CPU cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can users do to determine the performance level of their code on Volta nodes?",
    "answer": "Users can run test tasks lasting less than one hour to determine the performance level of their code."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many cores do the two most recent Volta nodes have?",
    "answer": "The two most recent Volta nodes have 40 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What parameter should be added to a job submission script to use one of the two newest 40-core Volta nodes?",
    "answer": "To use one of the two newest 40-core Volta nodes, the parameter `constraint=cascade,v100` must be added to the job submission script."
