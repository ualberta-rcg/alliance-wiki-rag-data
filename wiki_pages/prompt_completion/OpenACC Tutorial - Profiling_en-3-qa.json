    "question": "What is Computational Intensity in the context of compiler feedback?",
    "answer": "Computational Intensity of a loop is a measure of how much work is being done compared to memory operations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a Computational Intensity value of 1.0 or greater suggest?",
    "answer": "In compiler feedback, an `Intensity` value of >= 1.0 suggests that the loop might run well on a GPU."

  {
    "question": "Where is the `matvec()` function implemented in the example code?",
    "answer": "The `matvec()` function is implemented in the `matrix_functions.h` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key question to ask when searching for data dependencies in a loop?",
    "answer": "A key question is whether one loop iteration affects other loop iterations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the accumulation of values in a variable like `sum` considered a data dependency?",
    "answer": "No, the accumulation of values in `sum` is considered a reduction, which modern compilers are good at optimizing."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is efficient parallelism difficult for sequences like the Fibonacci sequence?",
    "answer": "Efficient parallelism is difficult for the Fibonacci sequence because each new value depends on the previous two, indicating a strong data dependency."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do loop iterations in the `matvec()` function read from and write to the same array in a dependent manner?",
    "answer": "No, the loop iterations in the `matvec()` function do not read from and write to the same array such that written values are used or overwritten in other iterations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the next step after code analysis is complete, regarding compiler interaction?",
    "answer": "After the code analysis is done, the next step is to add directives to the compiler."
