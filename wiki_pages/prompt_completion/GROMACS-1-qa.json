  {
    "question": "What is GROMACS?",
    "answer": "GROMACS is a versatile package used to perform molecular dynamics for systems with hundreds to millions of particles."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what type of molecules is GROMACS primarily designed?",
    "answer": "GROMACS is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have many complicated bonded interactions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can GROMACS be used for non-biological systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, many groups use GROMACS for research on non-biological systems, such as polymers, because of its speed in calculating nonbonded interactions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main strengths of GROMACS?",
    "answer": "GROMACS provides extremely high performance, offers CUDA-based GPU acceleration since version 4.6, includes a large selection of flexible tools for trajectory analysis, supports parallel execution via MPI or 'Thread MPI', and is free software under the LGPL, version 2.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the requirements for GROMACS GPU acceleration?",
    "answer": "Since GROMACS 4.6, excellent CUDA-based GPU acceleration is available on GPUs that have Nvidia compute capability >= 2.0 (e.g., Fermi or later)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does GROMACS support parallel computing?",
    "answer": "GROMACS can be run in parallel using either the standard MPI communication protocol or its own 'Thread MPI' library for single-node workstations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what license is GROMACS available?",
    "answer": "GROMACS is free software, available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the weak points of GROMACS?",
    "answer": "Weak points include limited on-the-fly analysis, potential difficulty in reproducing results across different versions, and that additional tools may not always be of the highest quality, contain bugs, or implement poorly documented methods."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it straightforward to obtain non-standard information from a GROMACS simulation?",
    "answer": "It may be a challenge to obtain somewhat non-standard information about the simulated system from a GROMACS simulation because GROMACS prioritizes high simulation speed over extensive on-the-fly analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are results from older GROMACS versions easily reproducible with newer versions?",
    "answer": "Reproducing results of older GROMACS versions with a newer version may not be straightforward due to significant differences in simulation methods and default parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check if my GROMACS version has GPU support compiled in?",
    "answer": "The top part of any GROMACS log file will describe the configuration, including whether your version has GPU support compiled in."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does GROMACS utilize computing resources for performance?",
    "answer": "GROMACS uses both CPUs and GPUs, relying on a reasonable balance between CPU and GPU performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What 'cutoff-scheme' is required for GPU acceleration in GROMACS?",
    "answer": "To use GPU acceleration, you must change the 'cutoff-scheme' in the mdp file to `cutoff-scheme = verlet`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the default 'cutoff-scheme' for GROMACS versions before 4.6?",
    "answer": "The behavior of GROMACS versions before 4.6 corresponds to `cutoff-scheme = group`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did 'cutoff-scheme = verlet' become the default in GROMACS?",
    "answer": "`cutoff-scheme = verlet` became the new default in GROMACS version 5.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are needed to run GROMACS 2024.4 on CPUs under StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "The modules `StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 openmpi/4.1.5 gromacs/2024.4` are needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are needed to run GROMACS 2024.4 on GPUs (CUDA) under StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "The modules `StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 openmpi/4.1.5 cuda/12.2 gromacs/2024.4` are needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are needed for GROMACS 2023.5 on GPUs (CUDA) in StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "The modules `StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 openmpi/4.1.5 cuda/12.2 gromacs/2023.5` are needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What compilation notes are provided for GROMACS 2024.4, 2024.1, 2023.5, and 2023.3 when using StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "These versions are compiled with GCC, FlexiBLAS & FFTW."
