    "question": "What can cause repeated failures when trying to establish a new VNC connection?",
    "answer": "Repeated failures to establish a new vncserver/vncviewer connection might be caused by an existing SSH tunnel on your computer that is blocking ports."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check for existing SSH tunnels that might be blocking VNC connection ports?",
    "answer": "To determine the presence of such tunnels, open a terminal window on your computer and launch the command `ps ux | grep ssh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to kill existing SSH tunnels?",
    "answer": "After identifying the process ID (PID) of the tunnels using `ps ux | grep ssh`, you can kill them with the command `kill PID`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which password should be used if the VNC screensaver asks for one?",
    "answer": "If your VNC screensaver asks for a password, you should enter the password for your cluster account, not the vncserver password."

    "question": "What are the two steps for connecting to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca?",
    "answer": "The connection to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca involves two steps: first, entering your username and CCDB password, and second, entering your passcode for multi-factor authentication."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if you enter an incorrect username/password in the first step of connecting to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca?",
    "answer": "If you enter an incorrect username/password for the first step, you will still proceed to the second step. After entering authentication details, you will receive a message indicating that the connection is established and then return to the first step's login screen."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a connection problem to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca be resolved if the username/password was incorrect in the first step?",
    "answer": "The solution is to retry, ensuring you have entered the correct username/password combination in the first step."

  },
  {
    "question": "How does the default software environment on VDI nodes differ from regular login nodes?",
    "answer": "Unlike regular login nodes where a standard software environment and some default modules are automatically loaded, VDI nodes do not load any modules by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command shows that no modules are loaded on a gra-vdi node by default?",
    "answer": "The command `module list` on a gra-vdi node would typically show 'No modules loaded'."
