    "question": "How can I unlock the MATE desktop screensaver if it gets stuck?",
    "answer": "If the MATE desktop is running and the screensaver doesn't unlock, try using the command `killall -9 .mate-screensaver`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the VNC screensaver still an issue on the clusters?",

    "question": "How many steps are involved in connecting to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca?",
    "answer": "Connecting to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca is done in two steps."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two steps for connecting to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca?",

    "question": "What capabilities do VDI nodes offer for applications?",
    "answer": "VDI nodes allow direct connections with vncviewer and graphic acceleration with OpenGL for applications configured accordingly."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does software loading differ on VDI nodes compared to regular login nodes?",
    "answer": "On regular login nodes, a standard software environment and some default modules are automatically loaded, but this is not the case with VDI nodes. Running `module list` on a VDI node will show 'No modules loaded'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you check which modules are loaded on a gra-vdi node?",
    "answer": "You can check loaded modules by running `module list` in the terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which module should be loaded on gra-vdi to access the same software as loaded by default on the clusters?",
    "answer": "Most users will find it sufficient to load the StdEnv module on gra-vdi."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to load the StdEnv module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To load the StdEnv module, use the command `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When would you need to load the SnEnv module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "In some rare cases, you might need to load one or more modules installed locally on gra-vdi, which requires first loading `SnEnv`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the SnEnv module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "You can load the SnEnv module using the command `module load SnEnv`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the current status of the `nix` module on gra-vdi or Graham?",
    "answer": "The `nix` module is no longer available on gra-vdi or Graham, and there's no indication it will be offered again."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the purpose of the `nix` module when it was available?",
    "answer": "When available, the `nix` module offered open-source software optimized for OpenGL acceleration."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which platforms was the `nix` module available?",
    "answer": "The `nix` module was only available on Graham and gra-vdi."
  },
  {
    "question": "How would one load the `nix` module when it was available?",
    "answer": "The module could be loaded with the command `module load nix`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did `nix` and `nix-env` commands facilitate software management in a personal environment?",
    "answer": "Once the `nix` module was loaded, the `nix` and `nix-env` commands were in your path to manage software packages via nix in your personal nix environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "How could users search for programs using `nix`?",
    "answer": "Users could search for programs with the command `nix search <regexp>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did one install a `nix` package, such as QGIS?",
    "answer": "To install a package like QGIS, you would use `nix-env --install --attr nixpkgs.qgis` after searching for it with `nix search qgis`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does a `nix` environment persist between connections?",
    "answer": "Yes, your nix environment persists between your connections, so you only need to run the installation command once."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can installed software be accessed again after loading the `nix` module?",
    "answer": "After loading the `nix` module, previously installed software, like QGIS, can be launched directly (e.g., `qgis`)."
