  {
    "question": "What does SSH rely on for its security?",
    "answer": "SSH relies on Public Key Cryptography (PK) for its security."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two components of a key pair in Public Key Cryptography?",
    "answer": "A key pair consists of a private part, which is kept secret, and a public part, which can be distributed freely."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Public Key Cryptography handle message encoding and decoding?",
    "answer": "Anyone can use the public key to encode a message, but the message can only be decoded with the private part."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is Public Key Cryptography sometimes referred to as asymmetric encryption?",
    "answer": "PK is sometimes described as asymmetric encryption because the public key encodes a message, but only the private part can decode it."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can Public Key Cryptography be used to verify identities?",
    "answer": "Possession of a private key establishes identity; if someone claims to be Alice, Bob can send an encoded message, and if the claimant can decode it, they have access to Alice's private key."
  },
  {
    "question": "What common internet protocols use Public Key systems as their basis?",
    "answer": "PK systems are the basis for the SSL and TLS protocols that protect most internet traffic, such as HTTPS websites."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what ways is Public Key Cryptography used in SSH on 'our systems'?",
    "answer": "On 'our systems', PK is used in SSH to ensure connection to the real server, establish an encrypted session for secure traffic, and allow the remote server to verify your identity for login."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to use Public Key Cryptography for connecting to 'our systems'?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is strongly recommended, as using PK is almost always more secure than using a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What initial steps are required to use Public Key Cryptography for SSH?",
    "answer": "To use PK, you must generate a key pair and install the public key on the systems you intend to connect with."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should an SSH key pair be generated?",
    "answer": "You should generate a key pair on your own system, or on a system you believe is secure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the rule regarding the sharing or copying of the private part of an SSH key pair?",
    "answer": "The private part of the key pair should never be shared or copied on another computer, just like a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a passphrase when generating an SSH key pair, and what is its purpose?",
    "answer": "A passphrase is a string that is used to encrypt the private key, providing protection if the private key file is stolen."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommendations for providing a passphrase for an SSH key?",
    "answer": "You should provide a strong passphrase that is memorable, recommending 15 characters or more."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the process for generating an SSH key pair differ based on the operating system?",
    "answer": "The specific process depends on the operating system, with different methods for Windows PuTTY or MobaXterm clients, Unix-like environments (Linux, Mac, Windows Subsystem for Linux or Cygwin), and OpenStack cloud."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the general goal of installing an SSH key?",
    "answer": "To install the key, you must make the target/destination system aware of the public part of your key."
  },
  {
    "question": "When was the CCDB method for installing SSH keys introduced?",
    "answer": "A convenient way to install SSH keys via CCDB was added in March 2021."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to install an SSH public key using CCDB?",
    "answer": "The first step is to go to CCDB at https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/ssh_authorized_keys or via the CCDB menu."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view your SSH public key on Linux/MacOS?",
    "answer": "Under Linux/MacOS, you can enter `cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub` on the command line to view your SSH public key."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view your SSH public key on Windows?",
    "answer": "Under Windows, you can examine your public key by opening the file with Notepad, as it is plain text."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the example public key provided in the documentation be used by users?",
    "answer": "No, you must generate your own pair of public and private keys; the provided example cannot be copied for your own use."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if a public key generated by PuTTY or MobaXterm is in a different format than the example?",
    "answer": "You should open PuTTY Key Generator or MobaXterm SSH Key Generator, go to 'File --> Load private key', and grab the content under 'Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the final step in installing your SSH public key using the CCDB form?",
    "answer": "The final step is to upload your SSH public key into the CCDB form by pasting the public portion of your key and providing a description for it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can SSH keys loaded into CCDB be used for OpenStack cloud systems?",
    "answer": "No, OpenStack cloud systems cannot access the keys entered in the CCDB."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does it take for changes to public keys in CCDB to propagate to clusters?",
    "answer": "Changes to public keys will often propagate to clusters in a few minutes, but in some cases, it can take up to approximately 30 minutes."
