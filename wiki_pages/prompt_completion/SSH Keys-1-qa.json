  {
    "question": "What is the primary security mechanism that SSH relies on?",
    "answer": "SSH relies on public key cryptography (PK) for its security."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two parts of a key pair in public key cryptography?",
    "answer": "A key pair consists of a private part, to be kept secret, and a public part, which can be distributed freely."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does public key cryptography work in terms of encoding and decoding messages?",
    "answer": "Anyone can use the public key to encode a message, but the message can only be decoded with the private part."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is public key cryptography sometimes called asymmetric encryption?",
    "answer": "PK is sometimes described as asymmetric encryption because a public key encodes a message and only the private key can decode it."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can public key cryptography be used to verify identities?",
    "answer": "Possession of a private key establishes identity; if someone can decode a message encoded with a public key, they have access to the corresponding private key."
  },
  {
    "question": "What common internet protocols are based on public key systems?",
    "answer": "PK systems are the basis for the SSL and TLS protocols that protect most internet traffic, such as HTTPS websites."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what ways is Public Key (PK) used in SSH on the systems described?",
    "answer": "PK is used in SSH to ensure the client connects to an authentic server, to establish an encrypted session for secure traffic, and for the remote server to verify your identity for login."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is using Public Key (PK) recommended for connecting to these systems?",
    "answer": "Using PK is strongly recommended because it is almost always more secure than using a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What two main actions are required to use Public Key (PK) for SSH?",
    "answer": "To use PK, you must generate a key pair and install the public key on the systems you intend to connect with."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should you generate an SSH key pair?",
    "answer": "You should generate a key pair on your own system, or on a system you believe is secure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the rule regarding sharing or copying the private part of an SSH key pair?",
    "answer": "The private part of the key pair should never be shared or copied on another computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a passphrase used for when generating an SSH key pair?",
    "answer": "A passphrase is a string that is used to encrypt the private key."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommendations for creating a passphrase for an SSH key?",
    "answer": "You should provide a strong, memorable passphrase of 15 characters or more, as this offers protection if the private key file is stolen."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find instructions for generating SSH keys for Windows PuTTY or MobaXterm clients?",
    "answer": "For Windows PuTTY or MobaXterm clients, users should refer to the 'Generating SSH keys in Windows' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find instructions for generating SSH keys in a Unix-like environment?",
    "answer": "For a Unix-like environment (Linux, Mac, Windows Subsystem for Linux or Cygwin), users should refer to the 'Using SSH keys in Linux' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does OpenStack provide a method for creating SSH key pairs, and where can information about it be found?",
    "answer": "Yes, OpenStack provides a method for creating key pairs, which can be found in the 'SSH key pair' section on the Cloud Quick Start page."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to install an SSH key using the CCDB method?",
    "answer": "The first step is to go to CCDB at https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/ssh_authorized_keys or via the CCDB menu."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view your SSH public key on a Linux/MacOS command line?",
    "answer": "Under Linux/MacOS, you can view your public key by entering `cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub` on the command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view your SSH public key on Windows?",
    "answer": "Under Windows, you can examine your public key by opening the file with Notepad."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the example public key provided in the document be copied for personal use?",
    "answer": "No, you must generate your own pair of public and private keys; you cannot copy the example for your own use."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if a public key generated by PuTTY or MobaXterm is in a different format than OpenSSH authorized_keys?",
    "answer": "You can open PuTTY Key Generator or MobaXterm SSH Key Generator, go to 'File --> Load private key' and grab the content under 'Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys'."
