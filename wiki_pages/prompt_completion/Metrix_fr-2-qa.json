    "question": "What information is displayed at the top of a CPU task page?",
    "answer": "At the top of the page, you will find the task name, its number, your username, and its status."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users view the details of their submission script for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "The details of your submission script are displayed by clicking on 'Voir le script de la t\u00e2che'."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the submission script not available for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "If the task was launched in interactive mode, the submission script will not be available."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users access the working directory and submission command for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "The working directory and submission command are accessible by clicking on 'Voir la commande de soumission'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of information is found in the section following the task and script details?",
    "answer": "The next section is dedicated to scheduler information."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user access their CPU account tracking page from a task's details?",
    "answer": "You can access the tracking page of your CPU account by clicking on your account number."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can users find in the 'Ressources' section of a CPU task page?",
    "answer": "In the 'Ressources' section, you can get an initial overview of your task's resource usage by comparing the 'Allou\u00e9s' (Allocated) and 'Utilis\u00e9s' (Used) columns for the listed parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'CPU' graph visualize for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'CPU' graph allows you to visualize, over time, the CPU cores you have requested."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there options to customize the 'CPU' graph visualization?",
    "answer": "Yes, to the right of the 'CPU' graph, you can select/deselect different cores as needed. However, this graph is not available for very short tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'M\u00e9moire' (Memory) graph show for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'M\u00e9moire' graph allows you to visualize, over time, the memory usage you have requested."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Process and threads' graph?",
    "answer": "The 'Process and threads' graph allows you to observe different parameters related to processes and execution threads."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal sum of 'Running threads' and 'Sleeping threads' for a multithreaded task?",
    "answer": "Ideally, for a multithreaded task, the sum of 'Running threads' and 'Sleeping threads' should not exceed twice the number of cores requested."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it normal to see 'Sleeping threads' for some programs?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is quite normal to have some processes in 'dormant' (Sleeping threads) mode for certain types of programs like Java, Matlab, commercial software, or complex programs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the file system graphs for a CPU task represent?",
    "answer": "These graphs represent the file system usage specifically for the current task, not for the entire node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is file system activity displayed in the task-specific file system graphs?",
    "answer": "On the left, a representation of the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) is displayed. On the right, the graph illustrates the data transfer rate between the task and the file system over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the utility of the data transfer rate graph for a task's file system usage?",
    "answer": "This graph helps identify periods of intense activity or low utilization of the file system."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can full node resource statistics be inaccurate?",
    "answer": "Full node resource statistics can be imprecise if the node is shared among multiple users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the left graph for full node resource statistics show?",
    "answer": "The left graph illustrates the evolution of bandwidth used by the task over time, in relation to software, licenses, etc."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the right graph for full node resource statistics represent?",
    "answer": "The right graph represents the evolution of network bandwidth used by a task or set of tasks via the Infiniband network over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of events can be observed from the Infiniband network bandwidth graph?",
    "answer": "Periods of massive data transfer can be observed, such as read/write operations on a file system (Lustre) or MPI communication between nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information does the left graph provide about local disk usage?",
    "answer": "The left graph illustrates the evolution of the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) performed on the local disk over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the right graph show regarding local disk usage?",
    "answer": "The right graph shows the evolution of bandwidth used on the local disk over time, which means the amount of data read or written per second."
  }
