  {
    "question": "What can be found in the 'Ressources' section of a GPU task page?",
    "answer": "In the 'Ressources' section, you can get an initial overview of your task's resource utilization by comparing the 'Allou\u00e9s' (Allocated) and 'Utilis\u00e9s' (Used) columns for the different parameters listed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'CPU' graph on a GPU task page show?",

    "answer": "The CPU graph is not available for very short GPU tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'M\u00e9moire' graph show for a GPU task's CPU usage?",
    "answer": "The 'M\u00e9moire' graph allows you to visualize the memory usage requested for the CPUs over time for a GPU task."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information does the 'Process and threads' graph provide for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'Process and threads' graph allows you to observe different parameters related to processes and execution threads for a GPU task."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do the file system utilization graphs for a GPU task show the usage for the entire node?",
    "answer": "No, the file system utilization graphs for a GPU task represent the usage for the current task only, not the entire node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is represented on the left side of the file system utilization graphs for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "On the left side, a representation of the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) is displayed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is shown on the right side of the file system utilization graphs for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "On the right side, the graph illustrates the data transfer rate between the task and the file system over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the data transfer rate graph in file system utilization for a GPU task?",
    "answer": "This graph allows identifying periods of intense activity or low file system usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' parameter indicate in the GPU graph, and what is its ideal value?",
    "answer": "The 'Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) active' parameter indicates the percentage of time during which the GPU executes a warp in the last sampling window, and its ideal value should be around 80%."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'SM occupancy' and what value is generally expected?",
    "answer": "'SM occupancy' is defined as the ratio between the number of warps assigned to an SM and the maximum number of warps an SM can handle, with a value around 50% generally expected."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal value for the 'Tensor' parameter in GPU usage and why?",
    "answer": "The 'Tensor' parameter's value should be as high as possible, because ideally, your code should exploit this part of the GPU, which is optimized for multidimensional matrix multiplications and convolutions."
