    "question": "What are the SBATCH directives used in the example ORCA job script?",
    "answer": "The SBATCH directives are `--account=def-youPIs`, `--ntasks=8`, `--mem-per-cpu=3G`, `--time=00-03:00`, and `--output=benzene.log`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPUs are requested in the example ORCA job script?",
    "answer": "The example ORCA job script requests 8 CPUs using `#SBATCH --ntasks=8`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the memory per CPU specified in the example ORCA job script?",
    "answer": "The memory per CPU is specified as 3G using `#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3G`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are loaded in the example ORCA job script for ORCA version 4.2.1?",
    "answer": "The modules loaded are `StdEnv/2020`, `gcc/9.3.0`, `openmpi/4.0.3`, and `orca/4.2.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the ORCA program executed in the example job script?",
    "answer": "The ORCA program is executed using `$EBROOTORCA/orca benzene.inp`."

  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `%pal nprocs <ncores> end` line in the ORCA input file?",
    "answer": "This line ensures that the program runs efficiently and utilizes all the resources or cores asked for in your job script, where `<ncores>` should be replaced by the number of cores used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file needs to be deleted to restart an ORCA calculation?",
    "answer": "To restart a calculation, you should delete the `*.hostnames` file (e.g., `benzene.hostnames`) before submitting the follow-up job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What error message might occur if the `*.hostnames` file is not deleted before restarting an ORCA calculation?",
    "answer": "If the `*.hostnames` file is not deleted, the job is likely to fail with the error message 'All nodes which are allocated for this job are already filled.'"

  {
    "question": "What type of calculations might experience OpenMPI related fatal errors due to version inconsistency?",
    "answer": "For some calculations, particularly DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD, users could receive unknown OpenMPI related fatal errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the officially recommended OpenMPI version for ORCA/4.2.0?",
    "answer": "The officially recommended OpenMPI version for ORCA/4.2.0 is 3.1.4."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a custom OpenMPI version 3.1.4 be prepared as a temporary fix for orca/4.2.0?",
    "answer": "First, load `gcc/7.3.0`, then run `eb OpenMPI-3.1.2-GCC-7.3.0.eb --try-software-version=3.1.4`."

  {
    "question": "What is the nature of the OpenMPI version inconsistency fix described in the document?",
    "answer": "It is a temporary fix prior to the official upgrade of OpenMPI on the clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done with manually installed ORCA binaries once the official OpenMPI version is updated?",
    "answer": "Manually installed ORCA binaries should be deleted once the official OpenMPI version is up to date."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the custom OpenMPI compiling command apply to OpenMPI 2.1.x?",
