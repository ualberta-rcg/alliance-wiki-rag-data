  {
    "question": "How can optimal memory and CPU usage be determined for completed Abaqus jobs?",
    "answer": "For completed jobs, use the `seff JobNumber` command to check 'Memory Utilized', 'Memory Efficiency', 'CPU (time) Utilized', and 'CPU Efficiency'. Adjust the `#SBATCH --mem=` or `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=` settings if efficiency is less than ~90%."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I monitor resource utilization for a running Abaqus job on a compute node?",
    "answer": "For running jobs, use the command `srun --jobid=JOB_NUMBER --pty top -d 5 -u $USER` to monitor %CPU, %MEM, and RES for each Abaqus parent process on the compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the formula for mapping Abaqus cores to tokens?",
    "answer": "The formula used is TOKENS = floor[5 X CORES^0.422]."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many additional tokens are required for each GPU used with Abaqus?",
    "answer": "Each GPU used requires 1 additional Abaqus token."

  {
    "question": "What are the initial steps to prepare Firefox on gra-vdi for viewing Abaqus online documentation?",
    "answer": "First, connect to `gra-vdi.computecanada.ca` with TigerVNC and open a terminal to type `firefox`. Then, in the Firefox address bar, type `about:config`, click 'I accept the risk!', search for 'unique', and double-click `privacy.file_unique_origin` to change it from true to false."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you access the Abaqus online documentation on gra-vdi after preparing Firefox?",
    "answer": "After preparing Firefox, connect to `gra-vdi.computecanada.ca` with TigerVNC, open a terminal and type `firefox`. Then, copy-paste a documentation path, such as `file:///opt/sharcnet/abaqus/2021/doc/English/DSSIMULIA_Established.htm`, into the search bar."
