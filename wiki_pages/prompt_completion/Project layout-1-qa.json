    "question": "On which clusters is the project filesystem organized on the basis of groups?",
    "answer": "The project filesystem is organized on B\u00e9luga, Cedar, Graham, and Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I access my project space?",
    "answer": "You can access your project space through symbolic links in your home directory, typically in the form `$HOME/projects/group_name`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who owns the group space on the project filesystem?",
    "answer": "The group space is owned by the principal investigator (PI) for that group."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default permissions for group members on the project space directory?",
    "answer": "Group members have read and write permission on the project space directory, but by default, a newly created file will only be readable by group members."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a group create a directory where newly created files are writeable by all group members by default?",
    "answer": "First create the directory using `mkdir $HOME/projects/def-profname/group_writable`, then set ACLs with `setfacl -d -m g::rwx $HOME/projects/def-profname/group_writable`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more information about sharing data, file ownership, and ACLs?",
    "answer": "You can find more information by referring to the 'Sharing data' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default quota for project space?",
    "answer": "The project space has a default quota of 1 TB and 500,000 files per group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the project space quota be increased, and if so, how?",
    "answer": "Yes, the quota can be increased up to 10 TB of space upon request to Technical support."
  },
  {
    "question": "How might groups obtain significantly higher project space quotas?",
    "answer": "Certain groups may have been awarded significantly higher quotas through the annual Resource Allocation Competition."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is project storage allocation transferable between clusters?",
    "answer": "No, project storage allocation is specific to a particular cluster and cannot normally be transferred to another cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to check current disk usage and available disk space?",
    "answer": "To check current usage and available disk space, use the command `diskusage_report`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why would I set the `setgid` bit on a project directory?",
    "answer": "Setting the `setgid` bit ensures that files and subdirectories created within that directory inherit the same group as the parent directory, ensuring they are counted against the expected quota."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I set the `setgid` bit on a directory?",
    "answer": "You can set the `setgid` bit on a directory with the command `chmod g+s <directory name>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I apply the `setgid` bit to existing subdirectories of a directory?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `find <directory name> -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod g+s`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does setting the `setgid` bit change the group membership of existing files?",
    "answer": "No, existing files and subdirectories will not have their group membership changed when `setgid` is set."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command should be used to change the group membership of existing files?",
    "answer": "The `chgrp` command should be used to change the group membership of existing files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the group membership of files moved into a directory with the `setgid` bit set?",
    "answer": "Files moved into the directory will continue to retain their existing group membership."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I modify my default group during an interactive session?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `newgrp` followed by the group name, for example, `newgrp rrg-profname-ab`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the `newgrp` command's effect on the default group permanent?",
    "answer": "No, `newgrp` only changes your default group for the particular session; you will need to reuse the command at your next login to change it again."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a common cause of 'disk quota exceeded' errors in project filesystems?",
    "answer": "A common cause is files being associated with the wrong group, such as your personal group, which has a quota of only 2 MB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the quota for a personal group?",
    "answer": "The quota for a personal group, which typically has the same name as your username, is only 2 MB."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I find and fix the group membership of files causing disk quota exceeded errors?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `find <directory name> -group $USER -print0 | xargs -0 chgrp -h <group>`, where `<group>` is a project group like `def-profname`."
