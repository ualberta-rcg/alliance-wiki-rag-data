  {
    "question": "How do you specify an interpreted User-Defined Function (UDF) in a Fluent journal file?",
    "answer": "To tell Fluent to interpret a UDF at runtime, you add a command line into your journal file before the case/data files are read or initialized, such as `define/user-defined/interpreted-functions \"sampleudf.c\" \"cpp\" 10000 no`. The filename should be replaced with your source file's name."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to use an interpreted UDF with parallel Fluent jobs?",
    "answer": "To use an interpreted UDF with parallel jobs, it will need to be parallelized as described in the 'Parallel' section of the documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to use a compiled UDF approach on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "To use a compiled UDF approach, your UDF must be compiled on an Alliance cluster at least once, which will create a `libudf` subdirectory containing the required `libudf.so` shared library."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the `libudf` directory for a compiled UDF be copied from a personal laptop to an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "No, the `libudf` directory cannot simply be copied from a remote system (like a laptop) to the Alliance because the library dependencies of the shared library will not be satisfied, leading to Fluent crashing on startup."
  },
  {
    "question": "When submitting jobs, how should the compile and load commands for a compiled UDF be managed in the journal file?",
    "answer": "Both compile and load `libudf` lines should not be left uncommented in your journal file when submitting jobs to the cluster. Only the 'load' command should be uncommented after the UDF has been compiled once, to prevent inefficient recompilation for every job and avoid build conflicts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Besides the journal file, how else can a compiled UDF be built?",
    "answer": "A compiled UDF can also be built using the Fluent GUI by navigating to the 'Compiled UDFs Dialog Box', adding the UDF source file, and clicking 'Build'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it necessary to parallelize a UDF for Fluent parallel jobs?",
    "answer": "Parallelizing a UDF is necessary for Fluent parallel jobs (single node SMP and multinode MPI) to control how and which processes run specific parts of the UDF code, ensuring efficient execution and preventing slow performance or immediate crashing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the procedure of parallelizing a UDF involve?",
    "answer": "The instrumenting procedure for parallelizing a UDF involves adding compiler directives, predicates, and reduction macros into your working serial UDF."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can detailed information on parallelizing UDFs be found?",
    "answer": "Detailed information on parallelizing UDFs is described in 'Part I: Chapter 7: Parallel Considerations' of the Ansys 2024 Fluent Customization Manual."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can User-Defined Functions (UDFs) be used for in relation to Discrete Phase Models (DPM)?",
    "answer": "UDFs can be used to customize Discrete Phase Models (DPM) as described in the Fluent Users Guide and Fluent Customization Manual."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are particle injections defined when working with DPM in the GUI?",
    "answer": "Particle injections are defined in the GUI by clicking the 'Physics' panel, then 'Discrete Phase' to open the 'Discrete Phase Model' box, and then clicking the 'Injections' button to create one or more injections."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can 'Point Properties' for DPM injections be specified by reading an injection text file in the GUI?",
    "answer": "To specify 'Point Properties' from an injection text file in the GUI, select 'file' from the 'Injection Type' pulldown in the 'Set Injection Properties' dialog, specify an 'Injection Name', and then click the 'File' button to select your `.dpm` or `.inj` text file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'Interaction with Continuous Phase' setting be enabled for DPM to update source terms every flow iteration?",
    "answer": "To enable updating DPM source terms every flow iteration, open the 'Discrete Phase Model Dialog Box' and select 'Interaction with Continuous Phase'. This setting can be saved in your case file or added via the journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example of journal file commands to automate DPM injection and list its properties.",
    "answer": "After solution initialization, you can add commands to your journal file such as:\n`/define/models/dpm/interaction/coupled-calculations yes`\n`/define/models/dpm/injections/delete-injection injection-0:1`\n`/define/models/dpm/injections/create injection-0:1 no yes file no zinjection01.inj no no no no`\n`/define/models/dpm/injections/list-particles injection-0:1`\n`/define/models/dpm/injections/list-injection-properties injection-0:1`"
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a basic manually created steady injection file format for DPM look like?",
    "answer": "A basic manually created steady injection file format might look like this:\n`(z=4 12)`\n`( x          y        z    u         v    w    diameter  t         mass-flow  mass  frequency  time name )`\n`(( 2.90e-02  5.00e-03 0.0 -1.00e-03  0.0  0.0  1.00e-04  2.93e+02  1.00e-06   0.0   0.0        0.0 ) injection-0:1 )`"
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find more details on the steady file format for DPM injections?",
    "answer": "More information on the steady file format for DPM injections can be found in 'Part III: Solution Mode | Chapter 24: Modeling Discrete Phase | 24.3. Setting Initial Conditions for the Discrete Phase | 24.3.13 Point Properties for File Injections | 24.3.13.1 Steady File Format' of the 2024R2 Fluent Customization Manual."
