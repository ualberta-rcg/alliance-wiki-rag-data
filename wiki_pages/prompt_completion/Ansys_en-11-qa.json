    "question": "What is the journal file command to tell Fluent to interpret a User-Defined Function (UDF) at runtime?",
    "answer": "The command is `define/user-defined/interpreted-functions \"sampleudf.c\" \"cpp\" 10000 no`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required for a UDF to be compiled on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "A UDF must be compiled on an Alliance cluster at least once, which will create a `libudf` subdirectory structure containing the required `libudf.so` shared library."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a `libudf` directory, containing a compiled UDF, be copied from a remote system (e.g., a laptop) to an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "No, the `libudf` directory cannot simply be copied from a remote system to the Alliance, as the library dependencies of the shared library will not be satisfied, potentially causing Fluent to crash on startup."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to transfer a compiled UDF's `libudf` directory to a different Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "Yes, once a UDF has been compiled on one Alliance cluster, its `libudf` directory can be transferred to any other Alliance cluster, provided the account loads the same StdEnv environment module version."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the journal file command to compile a UDF in Fluent?",
    "answer": "The command is `define/user-defined/compiled-functions compile libudf yes sampleudf.c \"\" \"\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the journal file command to load an already compiled UDF in Fluent?",
    "answer": "The command is `define/user-defined/compiled-functions load libudf`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are needed to use a UDF with Fluent parallel jobs?",
    "answer": "Before a UDF can be used with a Fluent parallel job (single node SMP and multinode MPI), it will need to be parallelized by adding compiler directives, predicates, and reduction macros into the serial UDF."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find detailed information about parallel considerations for Fluent UDFs?",
    "answer": "The subject is described in detail under 'Part I: Chapter 7: Parallel Considerations' of the Ansys 2024 Fluent Customization Manual."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can UDFs be used to customize Discrete Phase Models (DPM)?",
    "answer": "UDFs can be used to customize Discrete Phase Models (DPM) as described in 'Part III: Solution Mode | Chapter 24: Modeling Discrete Phase | 24.2 Steps for Using the Discrete Phase Models| 24.2.6 User-Defined Functions' of the 2024R2 Fluent Users Guide and 'Part I: Creating and Using User Defined Functions | Chapter 2: DEFINE Macros | 2.5 Discrete Phase Model (DPM) DEFINE Macros' of the 2024R2 Fluent Customization Manual."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you define the injection of particles in the Fluent GUI for a DPM simulation?",
    "answer": "In the GUI, click the Physics panel, then Discrete Phase to open the `Discrete Phase Model` box, and then click the `Injections` button. This opens an `Injections` dialog box where one or more injections can be created by clicking the `Create` button."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you specify DPM injection point properties by reading an injection text file in the Fluent GUI?",
    "answer": "In the `Set Injection Properties` dialog, select 'file' from the Injection Type pulldown, specify the Injection Name, and then click the `File` button to select an injection text file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are example journal commands to automate DPM settings and injections after solution initialization?",
    "answer": "Example commands include: `/define/models/dpm/interaction/coupled-calculations yes`, `/define/models/dpm/injections/delete-injection injection-0:1`, `/define/models/dpm/injections/create injection-0:1 no yes file no zinjection01.inj no no no no`, `/define/models/dpm/injections/list-particles injection-0:1`, and `/define/models/dpm/injections/list-injection-properties injection-0:1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example format for a basic manually created DPM injection steady file?",
    "answer": "A basic manually created injection steady file format might look like: `(z=4 12)\n( x y z u v w diameter t mass-flow mass frequency time name )\n(( 2.90e-02 5.00e-03 0.0 -1.00e-03 0.0 0.0 1.00e-04 2.93e+02 1.00e-06 0.0 0.0 0.0 ) injection-0:1 )`."
