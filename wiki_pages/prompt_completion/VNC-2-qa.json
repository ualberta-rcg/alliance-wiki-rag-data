    "question": "What kind of desktop is started when a VNC server is initiated as per the example?",
    "answer": "A 'TurboVNC' desktop is started, for example, 'TurboVNC: l4.nibi.sharcnet:1 (yourusername)'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the log file for the started VNC server typically located?",
    "answer": "The log file is typically located at `/home/yourusername/.vnc/l4.nibi.sharcnet:1.log`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which VNC technology is the `vncserver` command in StdEnv/2023 based on?",
    "answer": "The `vncserver` command in StdEnv/2023 is based on TurboVNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What option should be added when starting a new `vncserver` on a login node to ensure it terminates automatically?",
    "answer": "The `-idletimeout seconds` option should be added to ensure the `vncserver` eventually terminates if no VNC viewer connections are active."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required the first time you start `vncserver`?",
    "answer": "The first time you start `vncserver`, you will be required to set a password."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is a password needed for the VNC server?",
    "answer": "The password will be required to remotely connect to your desktop with a VNC client (such as `vncviewer`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you allow multiple connections to a VNC server with the same password?",
    "answer": "Multiple connections are possible if the `vncserver` was started by appending the additional `-alwaysshared` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you determine which port your `vncserver` is listening on?",
    "answer": "You can determine the port your `vncserver` is listening on by running `grep -iE \"\\sport|kill\"` on its log file."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will the VNC server continue to run after exiting the login node?",
    "answer": "Yes, the `vncserver` you started will continue running until the time limit specified with the `-idletimeout` option is reached."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of starting an SSH tunnel for VNC?",
    "answer": "Starting an SSH tunnel will forward an arbitrary local port to the port your VNC server is listening on remotely."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example command for starting an SSH tunnel from a laptop to a VNC server.",
    "answer": "An example command is `ssh nibi.computecanada.ca -L 5905:l4:5901`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to the VNC server from your desktop after setting up an SSH tunnel?",
    "answer": "You can either click the TigerVNC Viewer application icon and enter `localhost:5905` in the 'Connection details' dialogue box, or open a terminal and run `vncviewer localhost:5905`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations of running applications in a remote VNC desktop on login nodes?",
    "answer": "Applications running in a remote VNC desktop on login nodes are subject to memory and cputime limits."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should a user consider starting a VNC server on a cluster compute node instead of a login node?",
    "answer": "A user should consider starting a VNC server on a cluster compute node if they require more memory, CPU resources, GPU access for applications, or graphics acceleration."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to request resources for a VNC server on a compute node?",
    "answer": "The `salloc` command is used to request resources for a VNC server on a compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does a VNC server on a compute node automatically provide hardware-accelerated OpenGL capabilities?",
    "answer": "No, by default, a VNC server on a compute node will not have hardware-accelerated OpenGL capabilities."
