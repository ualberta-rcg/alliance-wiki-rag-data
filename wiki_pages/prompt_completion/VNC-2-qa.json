    "question": "What are the two main types of VNC servers you can connect to?",
    "answer": "You can connect to either a persistent VNC server running on dedicated VDI nodes or a temporary VNC server started on a cluster compute node. Lightweight sessions can also be run on cluster login nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are Graham's VDI nodes used for?",
    "answer": "Graham's VDI nodes (gra-vdi) provide a remote desktop environment equipped with accelerated OpenGL, intended for the most demanding and complex interactive graphical tasks like visualization and post-processing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do VDI nodes integrate with Graham's filesystems for data access?",
    "answer": "VDI nodes share Graham's `/home`, `/project`, and `/scratch` filesystems, making data created by jobs on Graham immediately accessible on gra-vdi for visualization and post-processing without the need for transfer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the process for connecting to gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To connect, start VNC viewer (TigerVNC) on your laptop and enter `gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca` or `gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca` as the VNC server, then enter your Alliance credentials at the login screen."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should users know about the `$SCRATCH` directory on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "On gra-vdi, `$SCRATCH` is defined as `/local/tmp/$USER` and any data left there will eventually be deleted (potentially in 60 days) due to limited disk space, so it should not be used for permanent storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are VDI nodes suitable for long-running computations?",
    "answer": "No, gra-vdi is a shared resource intended for visualization tasks. Long-running 'heavy' computations should be performed on a cluster compute node or using interactive OpenOnDemand infrastructure to ensure resources are available for others' graphical work."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of applications can be run on a VNC desktop on a cluster login node?",
    "answer": "You may run lightweight applications that do not require much memory, cputime, or a GPU, as login node limits will apply."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you log in to a cluster login node from your laptop to prepare for a VNC server?",
    "answer": "You must login to a cluster login node using SSH, for example, by running `ssh nibi.alliancecan.ca` from your laptop."
  },
  {
    "question": "Before starting a new VNC server on a login node, how can you check for and kill existing unused servers?",
    "answer": "First, run `vncserver -list` to check for old unused VNC servers, then kill them all by running the command `pkill Xvnc -u $USER`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start a VNC server on a login node with an idle timeout, and what is the purpose of this option?",
    "answer": "You can start it with `vncserver -idletimeout seconds` (e.g., `vncserver -idletimeout 86400`). The `-idletimeout` option ensures the VNC server terminates after the specified number of seconds if there are no VNC viewer connections."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required the first time you start a VNC server?",
    "answer": "The first time you start a VNC server, you will be required to set a password, which is necessary to remotely connect to your desktop with a VNC client."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which VNC server option allows for multiple connections to the same desktop session?",
    "answer": "If the VNC server was started by appending the `-alwaysshared` option, then multiple connections to it can be made."
