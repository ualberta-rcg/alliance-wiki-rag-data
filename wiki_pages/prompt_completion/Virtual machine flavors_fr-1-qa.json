  {
    "question": "What are OpenStack flavors?",
    "answer": "OpenStack flavors for virtual hardware define parameters like the number of cores, RAM capacity, and disk space, allowing users to select an instance type just like choosing a physical server."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users view the available OpenStack flavors for their project?",
    "answer": "Users can view the available flavors in the Horizon dashboard or by using the command 'openstack flavor list --sort-column RAM' with the command-line client."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I need a specific OpenStack flavor that is not listed?",
    "answer": "If you need a flavor that is not displayed, you should write to nuage@tech.alliancecan.ca."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the prefixes 'c', 'p', and 'g' signify in OpenStack flavor names?",
    "answer": "By convention, the prefix 'c' designates 'compute', 'p' designates 'persistent', and 'g' designates 'vGPU'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are OpenStack flavor names structured?",
    "answer": "Flavor names start with a prefix, followed by the number of virtual CPUs or GPUs, a dash, and then the RAM quantity. If there's a second dash, it's followed by the secondary ephemeral disk size in gigabytes. For vGPU flavors, the flavor information is included after the vGPU details."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are 'c' type OpenStack flavors generally suitable for?",
    "answer": "'C' type OpenStack flavors are suitable for development, testing, and tasks with a limited execution duration."
  },
  {
    "question": "From what format are 'c' type OpenStack flavors started?",
    "answer": "'C' type OpenStack flavors are started from a qcow2 format image."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the redundancy status of disks in 'c' type OpenStack flavors?",
    "answer": "The virtual machine disks in 'c' type OpenStack flavors reside locally on the hardware executing the instance and are not redundant (RAID 0)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical size of the root disk for 'c' type OpenStack flavors?",
    "answer": "The root disk for 'c' type OpenStack flavors is typically 20GB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the secondary ephemeral disk for data storage in 'c' type OpenStack instances?",
    "answer": "A secondary ephemeral disk for data storage is created and deleted with the instance."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the context of Arbutus, for what tasks are 'c' type flavors suitable?",
    "answer": "In Arbutus, 'c' type flavors are suitable for CPU-intensive tasks because they do not over-provision CPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what types of tasks are 'p' type OpenStack flavors suitable?",
    "answer": "'P' type OpenStack flavors are suitable for tasks with an indefinite execution duration."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommendation for the root disk when using 'p' type OpenStack flavors?",
    "answer": "The root disk is not predefined, and 'p' type flavors should be started from a volume. A volume of at least 20GB is recommended for the persistent root disk."
  },
  {
    "question": "What characterizes 'p' type flavors in Arbutus, and what are their typical use cases?",
    "answer": "In Arbutus, 'p' type flavors are on compute nodes with high redundancy (disk and network) and over-provision the CPU. They are suitable for web servers, database servers, and instances that generally have low or irregular CPU usage."
