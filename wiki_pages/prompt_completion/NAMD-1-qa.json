  },
  {
    "question": "What are the best single-node GPU configurations for efficiency and speed for the apoa1 system on Graham?",
    "answer": "Using 1 GPU/16 cores has the greatest efficiency, but 2 GPUs/32 cores is also acceptable if you need to get your results quickly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is there no benefit from running with 8 cores and 4 cores for the GPU benchmark on Graham GPU nodes?",
