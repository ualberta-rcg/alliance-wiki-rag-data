  },
  {
    "question": "What additional connection does MobaXterm open besides an SSH connection?",
    "answer": "MobaXterm also opens an SFTP connection, allowing file transfer to and from your VM using drag-and-drop via the left-hand panel."

    "question": "What is the recommended flavor for a Windows VM and why?",
    "answer": "The 'p2-3gb' flavor is recommended because Windows images are large and require a larger bootable drive than C-flavors provide. 'p2-3gb' also offers 3GB of RAM, which improves Windows VM performance compared to smaller 'p' flavors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a reasonable device size for the root drive of a Windows VM?",
