  {
    "question": "How is the Siemens Power on Demand (PoD) Key specified in the Trillium job script?",

  {
    "question": "How does the Trillium job script handle license failures?",
    "answer": "The Trillium job script includes a workaround for license failures that attempts to start Star-CCM+ up to 5 times (`i=1` to `i=5`) until the exit status is 0. There's a 5-second sleep before the second attempt and subsequent attempts."

  {
    "question": "How do you set up remote visualization for STAR-CCM+ 15.04.010 (or newer) on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Connect to a node with TigerVNC and open a terminal. Then, load `module load StdEnv/2020`, followed by `module load starccm-mixed/17.02.007` (or `starccm/16.04.007-R8`), and finally run `starccm+`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps for remote visualization of STAR-CCM+ 13.06.012 (or older) on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Connect to a node using TigerVNC. In a terminal, load `module load StdEnv/2016`, then `module load starccm-mixed/13.06.012` (or `starccm/13.06.012-R8`), and run `starccm+ -mesa`."

  {
    "question": "Which OpenGL implementation is currently used on gra-vdi for STAR-CCM+ and why?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How can you list available STAR-CCM+ versions on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "If you have already loaded a `StdEnv`, you can display available versions using the command `module avail starccm-mixed` in a terminal on the VDI node."

  {
    "question": "What commands are needed to run STAR-CCM+ 18.04.008 (or newer) for remote visualization on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Connect to gra-vdi with TigerVNC. In a terminal, execute `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023`, then `module load starccm-mixed/18.04.008` (or `starccm/18.04.008-R8`), and finally `starccm+ -rr server`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you set up remote visualization for STAR-CCM+ versions between 15.04.010 and 18.02.008 on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Connect to gra-vdi via TigerVNC. Open a terminal and enter `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2020`, followed by `module load starccm-mixed/15.04.010` (or `starccm/15.04.010-R8`), and then run `starccm+ -mesa`."
