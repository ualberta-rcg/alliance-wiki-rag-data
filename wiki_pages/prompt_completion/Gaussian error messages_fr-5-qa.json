  {
    "question": "What causes the 'KLT.ge.NIJTC in GetRSB' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "The MP2 calculation failed, possibly due to a pseudopotential issue mentioned in a previous error message."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve the 'KLT.ge.NIJTC in GetRSB' error?",
    "answer": "Use CEP-121G instead of CEP-121G*; they are the same for many elements."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Symbol XXX not found in Z-matrix' error?",
    "answer": "You have entered a variable name (e.g., 'H3NNN') that is not found in the Z-matrix."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you fix the 'Symbol XXX not found in Z-matrix' error?",
    "answer": "Enter the correct variable name or add it to the Z-matrix."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the error 'Variable X has invalid number of steps' indicate?",
    "answer": "It is an input error where you are trying to generate a rigid potential energy scan, and there are likely two empty lines instead of one between the Z-matrix and the variables."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the solution for the 'Variable X has invalid number of steps' error?",
    "answer": "Remove the extra empty line."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Problem with the distance matrix' error?",
    "answer": "This can be an input error where at least two atoms are too close to each other, or sometimes a programming error if a distance is NaN (not a number). It can also occur during diatomic molecule optimization if the initial distance is too large."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'Problem with the distance matrix' error be resolved?",
    "answer": "Check the variables and the Z-matrix of the atoms in question to see if some atoms are too close. This could also be due to a missing subtraction sign in a torsion angle for molecules with symmetric planes where connected atoms do not coincide (i.e., the distance between them is zero)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'End of file in ZSymb' error?",
    "answer": "This is an input error. The Z-matrix cannot be found, possibly because you omitted the empty line at the end of the geometry specifications or forgot to include `geom=check` when trying to retrieve the Z-matrix and parameters from a checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you fix the 'End of file in ZSymb' error?",
    "answer": "Add an empty line at the end of the geometry specifications or add `geom=check`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does the 'Linear search skipped for unknown reason' error occur?",
    "answer": "The RFO (rational function optimization) failed during a linear search. The Hessian matrix is likely no longer valid."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the solution for the 'Linear search skipped for unknown reason' error?",
    "answer": "Restart the optimization with `Opt=CalcFC`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Variable index of 3000 on card XXX is out of range, NVar=XX' error?",
    "answer": "This is an input error. You have forgotten to add a variable from your Z-matrix to the list; in this example, the variable defines atom number 15."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you fix the 'Variable index of 3000 on card XXX is out of range' error?",
    "answer": "Add the missing variable."
  },
  {
    "question": "What triggers the 'Unknown center XXX' error?",
    "answer": "This is an input error. You are trying to define an atom in a Z-matrix using another non-existent atom (e.g., 'X' in the example)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How to resolve the 'Unknown center XXX' error in a Gaussian calculation?",
    "answer": "Use the correct atom name."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does the 'Determination of dummy atom variables in z-matrix conversion failed' error occur?",
    "answer": "The conversion from redundant internal coordinates to Z-matrix coordinates failed due to dummy atoms. You will have to use Cartesian coordinates."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the solution when Gaussian fails to convert to the input Z-matrix after a geometric optimization, resulting in the 'Determination of dummy atom variables in z-matrix conversion failed' error?",
    "answer": "The geometric optimization has converged, but Gaussian was unable to reconvert to the input Z-matrix."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'malloc failed' signify in a Gaussian output?",
    "answer": "This is not strictly a Gaussian error. It indicates a lack of memory, possibly because you requested too much memory on the `%mem` line."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I fix a 'malloc failed' error in a Gaussian job?",
    "answer": "Decrease the value of `%mem` or increase the amount of memory specified in the job script with `--mem=`."
  }
