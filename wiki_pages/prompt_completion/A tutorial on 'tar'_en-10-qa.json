    "question": "How do you exclude specific files, such as those with the '.o' extension, when creating a tar archive?",
    "answer": "You can use the `--exclude` option with `tar`, for example: `tar -cvf your_archive.tar your_directory --exclude=*.o`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to decompress a file with a '.gz' extension?",
    "answer": "To decompress a `.gz` file, use the `gunzip` command, for example: `gunzip your_file.gz` or `gunzip your_archive.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you decompress a file with a '.bz2' extension?",
    "answer": "To decompress a `.bz2` file, use the `bunzip2` command, for example: `bunzip2 your_file.bz2` or `bunzip2 your_archive.tar.bz2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command allows you to list the contents of a compressed `.tar.gz` archive without decompressing it?",
    "answer": "You can list the contents of a `.tar.gz` archive using `tar -tvzf your_archive.tar.gz`. The `v` option provides verbose details, but is not strictly necessary for listing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view the contents of a compressed `.tar.bz2` archive without extracting it?",
    "answer": "To view the contents of a `.tar.bz2` archive without extracting it, use the command `tar -tvjf your_archive.tar.bz2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the single-step command to extract a compressed `.tar.gz` archive into a specific destination directory?",
    "answer": "You can use `tar -xvzf your_archive.tar.gz -C destination_dir` or `tar -C destination_dir -xvzf your_archive.tar.gz` to extract a `.tar.gz` archive into a specified directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a compressed `.tar.bz2` archive directly into a chosen directory?",
    "answer": "Use `tar -xvjf your_archive.tar.bz2 -C destination_dir` or `tar -C destination_dir -xvjf your_archive.tar.bz2` to extract a `.tar.bz2` archive into a specified directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two steps required to extract a `.tar.bz2` archive into a different directory?",
    "answer": "First, decompress the file using `bunzip2 your_archive.tar.bz2`. Second, extract the resulting `.tar` file into the destination directory using `tar -C destination_dir -xvf your_archive.tar`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you extract a `.tar.gz` archive to a specific directory in two separate steps?",
    "answer": "First, decompress the file using `gunzip your_archive.tar.gz`. Second, extract the resulting `.tar` file into the destination directory using `tar -C destination_dir -xvf your_archive.tar`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a single file or multiple specific files from an uncompressed `.tar` archive to a designated directory?",
    "answer": "Use the command `tar -C ./destination_dir/ --extract --file=your_archive.tar path-to-your-file`. You must explicitly provide the full path to the file(s) within the archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command would you use to extract a specific file from a compressed `.tar.gz` archive to a particular directory?",
    "answer": "To extract a specific file from a `.tar.gz` archive to a directory, use `tar -C ./destination_dir/ --extract -z --file=your_archive.tar.gz path-to-your-file`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you extract a single file from a compressed `.tar.bz2` archive to a specified destination directory?",
    "answer": "To extract a specific file from a `.tar.bz2` archive to a directory, use `tar -C ./destination_dir/ --extract -j --file=your_archive.tar.bz2 path-to-your-file`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command allows you to extract multiple files matching a wildcard pattern from an uncompressed `.tar` archive into a destination directory?",
    "answer": "You can use `tar -C ./destination_dir/ -xvf your_archive.tar --wildcards \"path-to-files/*.dat\"` to extract multiple files based on a wildcard pattern."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which `tar` option is used to preserve symbolic links when creating an archive?",
    "answer": "The `-h` option is used with `tar` to preserve symbolic links, for example: `tar -cvhf your_archive.tar your_directory`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to directly add files to an existing compressed archive like `.tar.gz` or `.tar.bz2`?",
    "answer": "No, files cannot be added directly to compressed archives. You must first decompress the archive file, add the desired files, and then recompress it."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you check the size of files or directories in a human-readable format?",
    "answer": "Use the `du -sh` command followed by the names of the files or directories you want to check, for example: `du -sh your_file your_archive.tar dir1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you split a large file or tar file into smaller parts of a specified size?",
    "answer": "You can use the `split -b` command, specifying the size in MB and a prefix name. For example, `split -b 1000MB your_archive.tar small-res` will split `your_archive.tar` into 1000MB parts named `small-resaa`, `small-resab`, etc."
  },
  {
    "question": "Once a file has been split into smaller parts using the `split` command, how do you recover the original file?",
    "answer": "To recover the original file from split parts, use the `cat` command with a wildcard for the part names, redirecting the output to the desired original filename. For example: `cat small_res* > your_archive_name.tar`."
