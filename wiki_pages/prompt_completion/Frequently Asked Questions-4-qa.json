  {
    "question": "What do the `Resources` and `Priority` values in the `(REASON)` column of `squeue` output indicate for pending jobs?",
    "answer": "`Resources` indicates the cluster is busy, suggesting you might consider submitting a job that asks for fewer resources. `Priority` indicates your job is waiting due to lower priority because your research group has been over-consuming cluster resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I monitor my research group's consumption of cluster resources?",
    "answer": "You can track your research group's over- or under-consumption of cluster resources using the `sshare` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a `LevelFS` value greater than one signify regarding cluster resource consumption?",
    "answer": "When `LevelFS` is greater than one, it means you are consuming fewer resources than your fair share."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a `LevelFS` value less than one signify regarding cluster resource consumption?",
    "answer": "When `LevelFS` is less than one, it means you are consuming more resources than your fair share."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does consuming more than my fair share of cluster resources affect my job priority?",
    "answer": "The more you overconsume resources (i.e., the closer `LevelFS` gets to zero), the more your pending jobs will decrease in priority."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the meaning of the `squeue` messages \"Nodes required for job are DOWN, DRAINED or RESERVED for jobs in higher priority partitions\" or \"ReqNodeNotAvailable\"?",
    "answer": "These messages, new to Slurm 19.05, mean that one or more nodes Slurm considered for the job are down, deliberately taken offline, or being reserved for other jobs. They are not error messages; jobs submitted are still in the queue and will eventually be processed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the `START_TIME` displayed in `squeue` output for pending jobs accurate?",
    "answer": "The `START_TIME` Slurm forecasts for high-priority pending jobs depends on rapidly changing conditions and is generally not very useful. Slurm often discards and recomputes its future plans."
  },
  {
    "question": "For which type of jobs is the `START_TIME` reported by `squeue` accurate?",
    "answer": "For jobs which are already running, the start time reported by `squeue` is perfectly accurate."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does \"N/A\" mean when displayed as the `START_TIME` in `squeue` output?",
    "answer": "\"N/A\" stands for \"not available,\" meaning Slurm is not attempting to project a start time for those specific waiting jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are `.core` files that might appear in my directory?",
    "answer": "Core files are binary files, typically with the extension \".core\", containing a snapshot of a program's state at the moment it crashed or exited abnormally."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I delete `.core` files?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can delete `.core` files if you wish."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I prevent `.core` files from being created?",
    "answer": "You can prevent `.core` files from being created by adding the line `ulimit -c 0` to the end of your `$HOME/.bashrc` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I get a \"library not found\" error like `/lib64/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.18' not found` when installing binary packages?",
    "answer": "You should refer to the 'Installing binary packages' section for instructions on how to fix this kind of issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any Alliance clusters specifically designated for sensitive research data?",
    "answer": "No, the Alliance does not operate any cluster specifically designated for handling personal, private, or sensitive data, such as human clinical research data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are Alliance computing resources certified for specific security assurance levels required for certain sensitive datasets?",
    "answer": "No, none of the Alliance resources are certified as meeting specific security assurance levels which may be required for certain datasets."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is responsible for data protection and privacy when using Alliance resources?",
    "answer": "Responsibility for data protection and data privacy rests ultimately with the researcher."
