    "question": "How are research groups charged if their job requests more memory than the standard 1 core/4GB ratio?",
    "answer": "Research groups will be charged by memory. For example, a request for two cores and 5GB per core (10GB total) will be counted as 2.5 core equivalents for priority calculation, even though it only uses two bundles for cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do GPU resource usage calculations differ from core equivalents?",
    "answer": "GPU resource usage follows similar principles to core equivalents, but a Reference GPU Unit (RGU) is added to the bundle alongside multiple cores and memory, which must be included in the accounting for GPU-based allocation targets."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the general rule for charging research groups for RGU-core-memory bundles?",
    "answer": "Research groups are charged for the maximum number of RGU-core-memory bundles they use."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are research groups charged by RGU for GPU jobs?",
    "answer": "Research groups are charged by RGU if they use more RGUs than cores or memory per RGU-core-memory bundle. For example, requesting 2 P100-12gb GPUs (2 RGUs total) with a fictive bundle of 1 RGU, 3 cores, and 4GB memory, would result in being charged for 2 RGU equivalents."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what conditions are research groups charged by core for GPU jobs?",
    "answer": "Research groups are charged by core if they use more cores than RGUs or memory per RGU-core-memory bundle. For example, a request for 1 RGU, 5 cores, and 5 GB of memory (with a fictive bundle of 1 RGU, 3 cores, 4GB memory) would be counted as 1.66 RGU equivalents due to cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "When does memory usage dictate the charge for RGU-core-memory bundles?",
    "answer": "Memory usage dictates the charge when a research group uses more memory than RGUs or cores per RGU-core-memory bundle. For instance, requesting 1 RGU, 2 cores, and 6 GB of memory (with a fictive bundle of 1 RGU, 3 cores, 4GB memory) would be counted as 1.5 RGU equivalents due to memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many RGU equivalents is a V100-32gb GPU, 7.8 CPU cores, and 10.4 GB of memory worth on a fictive cluster?",
    "answer": "On a fictive cluster, a bundle with one V100-32gb GPU, 7.8 CPU cores, and 10.4 GB of memory is worth 2.6 RGU equivalents."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the RGU equivalent value for an A100-40gb GPU with 12 CPU cores and 16 GB of memory on a fictive cluster?",
    "answer": "On a fictive cluster, a bundle with one A100-40gb GPU, 12 CPU cores, and 16 GB of memory is worth 4.0 RGU equivalents."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do Alliance systems have a consistent RGU-core-memory bundle ratio across all clusters?",
    "answer": "No, Alliance systems have specific RGU-core-memory bundle characteristics, with only one ratio per cluster, meaning ratios vary between clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the RGU-core-memory bundle characteristics for the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "For the Fir cluster, the characteristics are 0.98 cores per RGU and 23.6 GB of memory per RGU."
