    "question": "How is a job charged if it requests more memory than the standard 1 core/4GB ratio?",
    "answer": "If a job requests more memory than the 1 core/4GB ratio, the research group will be charged by memory, and the job will be counted based on the core equivalents worth of memory requested."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example of a job charged based on memory in core equivalents?",
    "answer": "If a research group requests two cores and 5GB per core (10GB total memory), requiring 2.5 core equivalents worth of memory but only two core bundles, the job will be counted as 2.5 core equivalents when priority is calculated."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does GPU resource accounting differ from core equivalent accounting for job scheduling?",
    "answer": "GPU resource accounting follows the same principles as core equivalents, but a Reference GPU Unit (RGU) is added to the bundle alongside multiple cores and memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What must be included in the accounting for GPU-based allocation targets?",
    "answer": "The accounting for GPU-based allocation targets must include the Reference GPU Unit (RGU)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are research groups charged for RGU-core-memory bundles?",
    "answer": "Research groups are charged for the maximum number of RGU-core-memory bundles they use."
  },

    "question": "What components make up a fictive RGU-core-memory bundle as an example?",
    "answer": "A fictive RGU-core-memory bundle consists of 1 RGU, 3 cores, and 4 GB of memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances are research groups charged by RGU in an RGU-core-memory bundle?",
    "answer": "Research groups are charged by RGU when they use more RGUs than cores or memory per RGU-core-memory bundle."
  },
  {
    "question": "Give an example of a job charged by RGU equivalents.",
    "answer": "If a research group requests 2 P100-12gb GPUs (1 RGU each), 3 cores, and 4 GB of memory, the request is for 2 bundles worth of RGUs, so it will be counted as 2 RGU equivalents."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are research groups charged by core in an RGU-core-memory bundle?",
    "answer": "Research groups are charged by core when they use more cores than RGUs or memory per RGU-core-memory bundle."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example of a job charged based on core equivalents within an RGU bundle.",
    "answer": "If a researcher requests 1 RGU, 5 cores, and 5 GB of memory, the job will be counted as 1.66 RGU equivalents because the request is for 1.66 bundles worth of cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are research groups charged by memory in an RGU-core-memory bundle?",
    "answer": "Research groups are charged by memory when they use more memory than RGUs or cores per RGU-core-memory bundle."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example of a job charged based on memory equivalents within an RGU bundle?",
    "answer": "If a researcher requests 1 RGU, 2 cores, and 6 GB of memory, the job will be counted as 1.5 RGU equivalents because the request is for 1.5 bundles worth of memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many RGU equivalents is a V100-32gb GPU with 7.8 CPU cores and 10.4 GB of memory worth on a fictive cluster?",
    "answer": "A bundle with one V100-32gb GPU, 7.8 CPU cores, and 10.4 GB of memory is worth 2.6 RGU equivalents on a fictive cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many RGU equivalents is an A100-40gb GPU with 12 CPU cores and 16 GB of memory worth on a fictive cluster?",
    "answer": "A bundle with one A100-40gb GPU, 12 CPU cores, and 16 GB of memory is worth 4.0 RGU equivalents on a fictive cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the RGU-core-memory bundle characteristics for the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "For the Fir cluster, the RGU-core-memory bundle characteristics are 0.98 cores per RGU and 23.6 GB memory per RGU."
