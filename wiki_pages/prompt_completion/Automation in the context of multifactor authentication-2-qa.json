    "question": "What is the test command to troubleshoot SSH connection difficulties to an automation node and get verbose output?",
    "answer": "To troubleshoot, use the command: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/automation_key -vvv username@robot.rorqual.alliancecan.ca \"ls -l\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-vvv` option in the SSH test command for automation nodes?",
    "answer": "The `-vvv` option enables \"Very Very Verbose\" debug output, which is useful for identifying connection problems."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you identify if your SSH client is using IPv4 or IPv6 from the debug output of the test command?",
    "answer": "Look for the \"Connecting to...\" message. If it shows an IP like `[199.241.166.5]`, IPv4 is being used. If it shows an IP like `[2620:123:7002:4::5]`, then IPv6 is being used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are two ways to explicitly make an SSH client use either IPv4 or IPv6?",
    "answer": "You can use the `-4` option to explicitly use IPv4 or the `-6` option to explicitly use IPv6 with the SSH client."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you force SSH to use IPv4 addresses when connecting to an automation node, using an IP address instead of the hostname?",
    "answer": "For Rorqual, you can try `ssh -i ~/.ssh/automation_key -vvv username@132.219.138.79 \"ls -l\"` to force SSH to use IPv4 addresses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is considered a last-resort method to ensure only IPv4 is used for connections to automation nodes?",
    "answer": "Disabling IPv6 addressing for your computer is a last-resort method, but Microsoft does not recommend it."

  {
    "question": "Which Python module is recommended for automating workflows with automation nodes?",
    "answer": "The Paramiko Python module is recommended for automating workflows with automation nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load an Ed25519 SSH private key from a file using Paramiko?",
    "answer": "You can load an Ed25519 key using `key = paramiko.Ed25519Key.from_private_key_file(\"/home/username/.ssh/cc_allowed\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Paramiko policy can be set to allow connecting to a host even if it's not known?",
    "answer": "The `paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()` can be set using `ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you execute a command on a remote host via SSH using Paramiko?",
    "answer": "After connecting, use `stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command(cmd)` to execute a command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended way to install Paramiko to ensure support for Ed25519 key types?",
    "answer": "Install Paramiko using the command `pip install paramiko[all]` to ensure Ed25519 key type support."
