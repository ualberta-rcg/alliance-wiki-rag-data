  {
    "question": "What is Open Babel?",
    "answer": "Open Babel is a chemical toolbox designed to manage and convert various chemical data languages, enabling users to search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling, chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find additional information on how to use Open Babel?",
    "answer": "For further information, users should refer to the Open Babel User Guide."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of Open Babel modules are available on the clusters?",
    "answer": "There are two kinds of modules for Open Babel installed on the clusters: `openbabel` (serial version) and `openbabel-omp` (parallelized version)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `openbabel` module used for?",
    "answer": "The `openbabel` module is the serial version of Open Babel, safely used to convert chemical structure files between different formats, even on login nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Open Babel module is recommended for most users?",
    "answer": "The `openbabel` module is the right module for most users."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the serial `openbabel` module be used on login nodes?",
    "answer": "Yes, the serial `openbabel` module can safely be used even on login nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the serial `openbabel` module?",
    "answer": "You can load the module using the command `module load openbabel`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `obabel` command shown in the `openbabel` example?",
    "answer": "The `obabel` command converts the molecule described in 'acetic_acid.mol' from `.mol` format to `.pdb` format, as shown in the example: `obabel -i mol acetic_acid.mol -o pdb acetic_acid.pdb`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `openbabel-omp` module?",
    "answer": "The `openbabel-omp` module is the version of Open Babel which has OpenMP parallelization enabled."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should the `openbabel-omp` module not be used on login nodes?",
    "answer": "The `openbabel-omp` module should not be used on login nodes because it can create many threads, causing disruptive load-spikes for other users, even for simple tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the parallel version of Open Babel (`openbabel-omp`) most useful?",
    "answer": "The parallel version of Open Babel (`openbabel-omp`) is useful when converting very large numbers of molecule structures or calculating large numbers of cheminformatics descriptors for multiple molecules."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variable needs to be set when using `openbabel-omp`?",
    "answer": "When using `openbabel-omp`, the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` must be set to specify how many CPUs Open Babel is allowed to use."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can Open Babel's functionality be accessed from Python?",
    "answer": "Open Babel's functionality can be used from Python because the Python interface for Open Babel has been added as extensions to both the `openbabel` and `openbabel-omp` modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Python packages are available for Open Babel after loading the necessary modules?",
    "answer": "After loading both `openbabel` (or `openbabel-omp`) and a compatible Python module, both the `openbabel` and `pybel` packages can be used."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the necessary modules to use Open Babel with Python?",
    "answer": "You need to load a Python module and an Open Babel module, for example: `module load python/3.11 openbabel/3.1.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check the installed Open Babel version within a Python script?",
    "answer": "After importing the `openbabel` package, you can check its version by printing `openbabel.__version__`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an SDF file as mentioned in the `openbabel-omp` example?",
    "answer": "SDF refers to a Structural Data File."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are Canonical SMILES representations?",
    "answer": "Canonical SMILES are a Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System used to represent molecules."
