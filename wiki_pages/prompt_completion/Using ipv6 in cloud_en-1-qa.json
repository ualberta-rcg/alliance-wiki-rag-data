    "question": "What types of IPv6 addresses are available in the Arbutus cloud environment?",
    "answer": "IPv6 Link-Local (LLA) and Global Unicast Addresses (GUA) are generally available within the Arbutus cloud environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is IPv6 Global Unicast Address (GUA) traffic handled in the Arbutus cloud?",
    "answer": "GUA can be set up via a separate interface, which in turn also handles only the IPv6 traffic."
  },
  {
    "question": "What method is used for setting up IP addresses on a VM interface in the Arbutus cloud?",
    "answer": "Addresses are set up using Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC), which automatically sets up the IP on the VM interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default security group rules for IPv6 GUA traffic from a VM?",
    "answer": "By default, the security group rules will allow all outbound traffic from the VM via the IPv6 GUA, but no traffic that originates from outside the VM will be allowed until specific security group rules have been defined."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you obtain the ID of a VM using OpenStack CLI to attach a network interface?",
    "answer": "You can get the ID of the VM by using the `openstack server list` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What OpenStack CLI command assigns a new network interface with IPv6 to a VM?",
    "answer": "To assign a new network interface to a VM using IPv6 as the network, use the command: `openstack server add network <VM_ID> IPv6-GUA`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check the status of an IPv6 network interface assignment using OpenStack CLI?",
    "answer": "You can check the status of the assignment by running `openstack server list` again."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to configure an IPv6 GUA using the OpenStack Webinterface?",
    "answer": "Log in to the dashboard, go to the 'Instances' menu, click on 'Attach Interface', select 'IPv6-GUA' from the network menu, and click on 'Attach'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to an IPv6 Global Unicast Address (GUA) when its interface is detached?",
    "answer": "Every time the interface is detached, the GUA is released and put back into the pool, thus, it can be used by anyone else."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does rebuilding or restarting a VM release its IPv6 GUA?",
    "answer": "No, rebuilding or restarting the VM will not release the GUA."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can access from any IPv6 GUA be granted in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "Access from any IPv6 GUA can be granted via 'Security Groups' in OpenStack, where the CIDR automatically detects the address type."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does an OpenStack network configured for IPv6 typically appear in a Linux system?",
    "answer": "The OpenStack network will appear in Linux as an additional eth-type interface, typically as /dev/eth1 if /dev/eth0 is the existing interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the easiest way for a Linux system to recognize a newly attached IPv6 enabled interface?",
    "answer": "The easiest way to pick-up your new device is to reboot."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you confirm if IPv6 is enabled on a Linux system?",
    "answer": "You can confirm if IPv6 is enabled with the command `sudo sysctl -a | grep ipv6.*disable`. The output should all end in zeros."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kernel parameters should be added to `/etc/sysctl.conf` for an IPv6-enabled `eth1` interface?",
    "answer": "You should add `net.ipv6.conf.eth1.forwarding=0` and `net.ipv6.conf.eth1.accept_ra=1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What configurations need to be added to `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1` for an IPv6 interface?",
    "answer": "Add `IPV6INIT=yes`, `IPV6_AUTOCONF=yes`, `IPV6_DEFROUTE=yes`, and `IPV6_FAILURE_FATAL=no` to `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you confirm the IPv6 configuration on a Linux system after applying settings?",
    "answer": "You may then confirm the IPv6 configuration with the command `ip -6 address`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you verify that IPv6 is working on a Linux system?",
    "answer": "You can confirm that IPv6 is working by running the command `ping6 -c 1 www.google.com`."
