    "question": "What does a Terraform plan indicate when adding a root volume to an existing VM configuration?",
    "answer": "The plan will indicate that the existing VM and its floating IP association must be replaced (destroyed and then recreated), often showing 'Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy' in the summary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What needs to be done with SSH keys if a VM is rebuilt by Terraform after adding a root volume?",
    "answer": "Your VM will be created with a new SSH key, so if you connected previously, you'll need to remove the SSH key from your `known_hosts` file (or the equivalent)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended action after a Terraformed VM is created or rebuilt?",
    "answer": "After the VM is created, the first thing to do is log on to it and apply all available updates by running `sudo yum update -y`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide the full Terraform configuration example for creating an OpenStack VM with a floating IP and a bootable volume?",
    "answer": "```terraform\nprovider \"openstack\" {}\n\nresource \"openstack_compute_instance_v2\" \"myvm\" {\n  name = \"myvm\"\n  flavor_id = \"0351ddb0-00d0-4269-80d3-913029d1a111\"\n  key_pair = \"Aluminum\"\n  security_groups = [\"default\"]\n\n  network {\n    name = \"my-tenant-net\"\n  }\n\n  block_device {\n    uuid = \"80ceebef-f9aa-462e-a793-d3c1cf96123b\"\n    source_type = \"image\"\n    destination_type = \"volume\"\n    volume_size = 10\n    boot_index = 0\n    delete_on_termination = true\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"openstack_networking_floatingip_v2\" \"myvm_fip\" {\n  pool = \"provider-199-2\"\n}\n\nresource \"openstack_compute_floatingip_associate_v2\" \"myvm_fip\" {\n  floating_ip = openstack_networking_floatingip_v2.myvm_fip.address\n  instance_id = openstack_compute_instance_v2.myvm.id\n}\n```"
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more resources and examples for Terraform and OpenStack?",
    "answer": "You can refer to the 'Introduction to Terraform', 'OpenStack provider' documentation, 'OpenStack compute instance resource' documentation, 'Our cloud documentation', and the 'Cloud Quick Start' guide. Examples include the 'Magic Castle' project and 'diodonfrost/terraform-openstack-examples' on GitHub."

  {
    "question": "How do you locate an image's UUID using the OpenStack Horizon web interface?",
    "answer": "To find an image\u2019s UUID, log into the web interface, find the `Images` menu item under `Compute`, and then click on the desired image from the list. The UUID will be displayed on the image details page."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended method for finding a flavor's UUID when using Terraform with OpenStack, especially if Horizon only provides the name?",
    "answer": "While Horizon only provides the flavor name, it is recommended to switch to using the OpenStack CLI to find the flavor's UUID. Alternatively, you can use the name for the first Terraform run, then extract the ID from the output or state file, and finally update your configuration to use the ID."
