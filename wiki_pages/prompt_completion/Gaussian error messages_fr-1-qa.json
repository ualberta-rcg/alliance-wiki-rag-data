    "question": "What does a normal termination of a Gaussian job look like in the output?",
    "answer": "A normal termination typically shows CPU and elapsed times, followed by a line stating 'Normal termination of Gaussian 16 at [Date and Time]'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What could cause a Gaussian job to fail without an explicit error message, if the output otherwise seems normal?",
    "answer": "Such a failure could indicate that your quota was exceeded, the execution time was longer than requested, the demanded memory was insufficient, or the task produced data exceeding the local disk capacity of the compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does an 'Erroneous Write' error typically appear in the output file?",
    "answer": "It appears as messages like 'Erroneous write. write [number] instead of [number]. fd = [number]' or 'Erroneous write during file extend. write -1 instead of [number] Probably out of disk space.'"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the common cause of an 'Erroneous Write' error?",
    "answer": "This error usually occurs when disk space is exhausted, either due to exceeding your quota, the disk being at full capacity, or, rarely, a network drive being unavailable."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the solutions for an 'Erroneous Write' error?",
    "answer": "You should check your quota with `quota` and delete unnecessary files, or try to reduce the basis set if your task is too large for the hardware."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a 'Link 9999' error described in the Gaussian output?",
    "answer": "The output typically shows 'Error termination request processed by link 9999. Error termination via Lnk1e in /disc30/g98/l9999.exe.', often preceded by optimization failure messages like 'Number of steps exceeded'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most frequent cause of a 'Link 9999' error?",
    "answer": "The most frequent cause is the non-convergence of a geometric optimization, leading to an abnormal termination due to an internal application reason."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are potential solutions for a 'Link 9999' error caused by non-convergence?",
    "answer": "Solutions include optimizing the starting structure at a lower theoretical level, restarting optimization from the last step using `geom=allcheck`, considering `opt=CalcFC` for less costly calculations, using a richer Hessian matrix with `Opt=ReadFC`, `Opt=CalcFC`, or `Opt=CalcAll`, modifying the Z-matrix or using default redundant internal coordinates if the coordinate system is problematic, or replacing the default optimization method with `opt=ef` or `opt=gdiis`."
