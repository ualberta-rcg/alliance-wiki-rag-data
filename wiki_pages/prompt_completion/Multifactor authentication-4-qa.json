    "question": "When using MobaXterm with multifactor authentication, why might I experience multiple authentication prompts?",
    "answer": "MobaXterm initiates three independent sessions: one to open the SSH terminal, one to display folder contents in the left pane, and one to start file transfers. Each of these may require authentication."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can cause MobaXterm operations to hang indefinitely after MFA adoption?",
    "answer": "When trying to open, download, or upload files using the navigation bar on the left, operations may hang because 1 or 2 hidden MFA-Duo windows might be waiting for authentication behind other windows. Additionally, each navigation to a different folder on the left pane starts another transaction requiring MFA."
