The SSW library provides an API for C, C++, and other languages, and is approximately 50 times faster than an ordinary Smith-Waterman implementation. It can return the Smith-Waterman score, alignment location, traceback path (cigar) of the optimal alignment accurately, and heuristically return sub-optimal alignment scores and locations."
