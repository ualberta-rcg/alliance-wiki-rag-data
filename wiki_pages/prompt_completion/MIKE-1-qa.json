  },
  {
    "question": "What is the general procedure for the third step of MIKE installation?",
    "answer": "The third step involves running version-specific commands to extract the archives, execute the `install.sh` installation scripts for each component, and then patch the binaries to enable them to find the dynamic libraries of Intel MPI."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract the installation archives for MIKE 2025?",
    "answer": "You change to the `$MIKE_TGZ` directory, then `unzip -j MIKE_Zero_2025_rhel9.zip` and `tar -xzf` for the other `.tgz` files like `MIKE_Common_2025_rhel9.tgz`."
  },
