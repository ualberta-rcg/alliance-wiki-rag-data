  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `mysub.sh` script provided as an example for a single task?",
    "answer": "The `mysub.sh` script is an example of how to submit a single task on Graham, using a full node and calling ADF directly."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many nodes and CPUs does the `mysub.sh` script request?",
    "answer": "The `mysub.sh` script requests 1 node with 32 CPUs per node."

  {
    "question": "What is the requested time limit for the job in `mysub.sh`?",
    "answer": "The requested time limit for the job in `mysub.sh` is 3 hours (00-03:00)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of ADF is loaded in the `mysub.sh` example script?",
    "answer": "The `mysub.sh` script loads ADF version 2019.305."
  },
  {
    "question": "What input file does the `mysub.sh` script use?",
    "answer": "The `mysub.sh` script uses `adf_test.inp` as its input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of calculation is defined in the `adf_test.inp` example file?",
    "answer": "The `adf_test.inp` example file defines a 'WATER Geometry Optimization with Delocalized Coordinates'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the atoms defined in the `adf_test.inp` input file?",
    "answer": "The `adf_test.inp` input file defines one Oxygen (O) atom at (0,0,0) and two Hydrogen (H) atoms at (0, -0.689440, -0.578509) and (0, 0.689440, -0.578509)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can multiple calculations be grouped into a single task with ADF or BAND?",
    "answer": "Multiple calculations can be grouped into a single task using a shell script that calls ADF multiple times, redirecting output and managing temporary files, similar to the `GO_H2O.run` example."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the name of the example script for running multiple ADF calculations?",
    "answer": "The example script for running multiple ADF calculations is named `GO_H2O.run`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What common steps are performed between calculations in the `GO_H2O.run` script?",
    "answer": "Between calculations in the `GO_H2O.run` script, the `TAPE21` and `logfile` files are removed using `rm TAPE21 logfile`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the `GO_H2O.sh` script differ from `mysub.sh` for executing multiple tasks?",
    "answer": "The `GO_H2O.sh` script is identical to `mysub.sh` except for its last line, which calls `bash GO_H2O.run` instead of calling ADF directly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What geometry optimization methods are demonstrated in the `GO_H2O.run` script?",
    "answer": "The `GO_H2O.run` script demonstrates Geometry Optimization with Delocalized Coordinates, Geometry Optimization in Cartesians with a new optimizer, Geometry Optimization with Internal Coordinates (Z-Matrix), optimization with (partial) specification of Hessian, and Geometry Optimization in Cartesians (from a Z-Matrix definition)."
