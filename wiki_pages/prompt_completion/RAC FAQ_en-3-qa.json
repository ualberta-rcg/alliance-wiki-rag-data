    "question": "If my total resource allocation was not sufficient, can I access more resources?",
    "answer": "Yes, users can access modest quantities of compute, storage, and cloud resources through the Rapid Access Service (RAS). For compute allocations, the total allocation is a target, not a strict limit, and you can continue working beyond it as the fair-share algorithm adjusts priority over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Rapid Access Service (RAS)?",
    "answer": "The Rapid Access Service (RAS) provides access to modest quantities of compute, storage, and cloud resources. It is a shared pool of unallocated resources and unlike the RAC, it is not a guaranteed allocation of specific computational resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the system prioritize compute allocations?",
    "answer": "Compute allocations generally use a fair-share algorithm for batch processing priority. Each user is allocated a share of total system resources, translating to priority access. If a user has recently used a large fraction of the system (more than their fair-share), their priority drops, but this is gradually 'forgotten' after some time of reduced usage."

  {
    "question": "What is the role of the Scientific Review Committees?",
    "answer": "Scientific Review Committees are responsible for peer-reviewing and scoring all applications submitted to the RAC. They assess and rate the merits of computational research projects within specific discipline-specific committees."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Scientific Review Committees are available?",
    "answer": "The available Scientific Review Committees include Astronomy, Astrophysics and Cosmology, Bioinformatics, Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biophysics, Computer Sciences and Mathematics, Engineering, Environmental and Earth Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, Nano, Materials and Condensed Matter, Neurosciences, Medical Imaging and Medical Physics, and Subatomic Physics, Nuclear Physics and Space Physics."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are scientific reviewers required to accept any agreements?",
    "answer": "Yes, scientific reviewers are required to accept the Alliance's Non-Disclosure Agreement and Conflict of Interest Policy before accessing any RAC application."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can applicants choose which Scientific Review Committee evaluates their proposal?",
    "answer": "Yes, applicants may choose their preferred Scientific Review Committee, though the Alliance reserves the right to reassign the proposal to a different committee after consultation with the Committee Chairs if necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Resource Access Program Administrative Committee (RAPAC)?",
    "answer": "The Resource Access Program Administrative Committee (RAPAC) oversees the entire competition process, provides technical support, and is responsible for making sure allocations 'fit' on existing ARC resources. It may apply scaling to allocations based on the overall score and is composed of technical and administrative leaders from various regions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is a Notice of Intent (NOI) required for RAC applications?",
    "answer": "No, a Notice of Intent (NOI) is not required for any RAC application process."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the Resources for Research Groups (RRG) application process?",
    "answer": "The RRG is a peer-reviewed application process for projects primarily focused on conducting research that requires compute, storage, and cloud resources to achieve their goals."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should I apply through RRG if my project primarily needs persistent cloud instances for a platform or portal?",
    "answer": "No, if your project primarily needs persistent instances in the cloud to provide a service through a platform or a portal, you should apply through the Research Platforms and Portal application process instead of RRG."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if my resource needs are below the minimum for an RRG application?",
    "answer": "If your resource requirements are less than the minimum for an RRG application, you do not need to submit an application. Instead, you should utilize the Rapid Access Service (RAS)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a researcher submit multiple RRG applications as a lead applicant?",
    "answer": "No, a Principal Investigator (PI) can only be the lead applicant for one RRG application, though they can participate as a collaborator on multiple RRG submissions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to reapply to RRG if I received an allocation last year?",
    "answer": "If you are eligible for the Fast Track process, you can either accept the invitation or decline and submit a new RRG application. You should submit a new application if you require more resources, especially compute or cloud, than you currently have allocated. Accepting Fast Track maintains needs, subject to scaling."
