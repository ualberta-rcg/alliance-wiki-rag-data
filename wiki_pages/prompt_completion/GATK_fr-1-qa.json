    "question": "What versions of GATK are listed as available?",
    "answer": "Available versions include gatk/3.7, gatk/3.8, gatk/4.0.0.0, gatk/4.0.8.1, gatk/4.0.12.0, gatk/4.1.0.0, gatk/4.1.2.0, gatk/4.1.7.0, gatk/4.1.8.0, gatk/4.1.8.1, gatk/4.2.2.0, gatk/4.2.4.0, and gatk/4.2.5.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user get more information about a particular GATK version, such as 4.1.8.1?",
    "answer": "To get more information on a specific version, use the command `module spider gatk/4.1.8.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What module is a prerequisite for GATK?",
    "answer": "The `StdEnv/2020` module is a prerequisite for GATK."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load a specific GATK version, like 4.1.8.1, along with its prerequisite?",
    "answer": "Load it with `module load StdEnv/2020 gatk/4.1.8.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the simplified command to load a GATK module if `StdEnv/2020` is already loaded by default?",
    "answer": "Simply use `module load gatk/4.1.8.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do more recent GATK versions (>=4.0.0.0) offer?",
    "answer": "More recent GATK versions (>=4.0.0.0) offer a wrapper for Java executables (.jar)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information does the `module spider` command provide regarding GATK usage?",
    "answer": "The `module spider` command provides usage information and examples for GATK."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the general usage syntax for GATK?",
    "answer": "The general usage syntax is `gatk [--java-options \"-Xmx4G\"] ToolName [GATK args]`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example of a GATK command?",
    "answer": "An example GATK command is `gatk --java-options \"-Xmx8G\" HaplotypeCaller -R reference.fasta -I input.bam -O output.vcf`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are arguments like heap memory passed to Java when using GATK?",
    "answer": "Arguments like maximum heap memory (`-Xmx8G`) are passed directly to Java using the `--java-options` flag."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Java option is recommended for debugging GATK program failures?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to always use `-DGATK_STACKTRACE_ON_USER_EXCEPTION=true` for more debugging information in case of program failure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is important to remember when passing options via `--java-options`?",
    "answer": "All options passed via `--java-options` must be enclosed in double quotes (\")."
  },
  {
    "question": "What option is recommended for `sbatch` tasks to redirect temporary files to local storage?",
    "answer": "For `sbatch` tasks, the `--tmp-dir` option with the configuration `${SLURM_TMPDIR}` is recommended to redirect temporary files to local storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can `GenomicsDBImport` performance be optimized on shared Posix filesystems like NFS and Lustre?",
    "answer": "To optimize `GenomicsDBImport` performance on shared Posix filesystems, ensure the `--genomicsdb-shared-posixfs-optimizations` option is activated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended if `genomicsdb-shared-posixfs-optimizations` is not possible or when using GNU Parallel with `GenomicsDBImport`?",
    "answer": "Copy the database to `${SLURM_TMPDIR}` and run the execution there to prevent I/O operations from disturbing the filesystem, as `${SLURM_TMPDIR}` is faster local storage."
