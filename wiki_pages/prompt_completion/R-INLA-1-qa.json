    "question": "What is R-INLA?",
    "answer": "R-INLA is an R package designed to perform approximate Bayesian inference for Latent Gaussian Models."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the installation of the R-INLA package more complex than typical R packages?",
    "answer": "The installation is more complicated because it downloads pre-compiled executables that must be made compatible with the Standard software environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "When was the provided R-INLA installation script last tested and with which R version?",
    "answer": "The installation script was tested in Summer of 2022 with R 4.2.1 and R-INLA."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules must be loaded for the R-INLA installation script to run successfully?",
    "answer": "The required modules are `gcc/9.3.0`, `r/4.2.1`, `geos/3.9.1`, `gdal/3.2.3`, `udunits/2.2.26`, and `gsl/2.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step in the `install_INLA.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The first step, marked as (1), is to load required modules: `gcc/9.3.0`, `r/4.2.1`, `geos/3.9.1`, `gdal/3.2.3`, `udunits/2.2.26`, `gsl/2.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the R-INLA package itself installed within the script?",
    "answer": "The R-INLA package and its dependencies are installed using the R command: `install.packages(\"INLA\", repos=c(\"https://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/\", INLA=\"https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable\"), dep=TRUE, Ncpus=2)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of step (3) in the R-INLA installation process?",
    "answer": "Step (3) is to install the pre-compiled executables that R-INLA requires, specifically by running `R -e 'library(INLA); inla.binary.install(os=\"CentOS Linux-7\")'`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are the pre-compiled executables patched in step (4) of the installation script?",
    "answer": "The pre-compiled executables are patched in step (4) to ensure they are compatible with the Standard software environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific actions are taken during the patching phase (step 4) of the R-INLA installation?",
    "answer": "The patching involves changing permissions (`chmod u+x`), modifying `.run` files to skip `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` exports using `sed`, and adjusting runtime search paths using `setrpaths.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Besides the installation script, where else do the required modules for R-INLA need to be loaded?",
    "answer": "The same modules (`gcc/9.3.0`, `r/4.2.1`, `geos/3.9.1`, `gdal/3.2.3`, `udunits/2.2.26`, `gsl/2.6`) also have to be loaded in the job script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific command is used to install the INLA binaries for a CentOS Linux-7 operating system?",
    "answer": "The command `R -e 'library(INLA); inla.binary.install(os=\"CentOS Linux-7\")'` is used to install the binaries."
