  },
  {
    "question": "What warning is given regarding the versions of packages and modules for R-INLA installation?",
    "answer": "Because R will always install the latest versions of packages, the versions of the modules will likely have to be adjusted in the future, even though the provided scripts have been tested with specific versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step when installing R-INLA according to the provided scripts?",
