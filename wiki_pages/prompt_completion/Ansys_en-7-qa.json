  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `script-flu-bycore+requeue.sh` script for Ansys Fluent?",
    "answer": "This script is designed for Ansys Fluent jobs that run on a cluster using a 'by core' allocation, and includes a mechanism to automatically requeue the job multiple times if it fails, typically due to license shortages."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify the total number of cores in a 'Multinode (by core + requeue)' Slurm script for Ansys Fluent?",
    "answer": "The total number of cores is specified using the `#SBATCH --ntasks=16` directive in the Slurm script, where '16' should be replaced with the desired number of cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is memory per core specified in an Ansys Fluent 'Multinode (by core + requeue)' Slurm script?",
    "answer": "Memory per core is specified using the `#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4G` directive in the Slurm script, where '4G' can be adjusted as needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure the number of requeue attempts for an Ansys Fluent job using a 'Multinode (by core + requeue)' Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The number of requeue attempts is specified using the `#SBATCH --array=1-5%1` directive, where '5' indicates 5 attempts (2 or more are recommended)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if an Ansys Fluent job using a requeue script completes successfully?",
    "answer": "If the job completes successfully, the script will output 'Job completed successfully! Exiting now.' and then cancel the entire Slurm array job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if an Ansys Fluent job using a requeue script fails and there are remaining attempts?",
    "answer": "If a job attempt fails due to a license or simulation issue and there are remaining attempts in the array, the script will output 'Resubmitting job now \u2026' and the job will be requeued."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the Ansys Fluent solution restart scripts?",
    "answer": "The solution restart scripts automate restarting very large jobs that might exceed the typical seven-day maximum runtime window on most clusters by restarting them from the most recent saved time step files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a fundamental requirement for Ansys Fluent jobs using the solution restart scripts?",
    "answer": "A fundamental requirement is that the first time step of the simulation must be able to complete within the requested job array time limit specified in the Slurm script when starting from an initialized solution field."
  },
  {
    "question": "What files are required to set up an Ansys Fluent solution restart job?",
    "answer": "A working set of `sample.cas`, `sample.dat`, and `sample.jou` files must be present."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the original `sample.jou` file be modified for a solution restart job?",
    "answer": "The `sample.jou` file should be edited to include `/solve/dual-time-iterate 1` and `/file/auto-save/data-frequency 1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create and modify a restart journal file for Ansys Fluent?",
    "answer": "First, copy `sample.jou` to `sample-restart.jou`. Then, edit `sample-restart.jou` to contain `/file/read-cas-data sample-restart` instead of `/file/read-cas-data sample`, and comment out the initialization line (e.g., `; /solve/initialize/initialize-flow`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the `sample-restart.jou` file be optimized if subsequent time steps run faster than the initial one?",
    "answer": "If the second and subsequent time steps are known to run twice as fast, you can edit `sample-restart.jou` to specify `/solve/dual-time-iterate 2` to minimize computationally expensive solution restarts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum time limit that can be requested for a Slurm job array, as mentioned in the solution restart section?",
    "answer": "The maximum time limit that can be specified for a Slurm job array is `#SBATCH --time=07-00:00` (seven days)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the total simulation time calculated for a solution restart job if '/solve/dual-time-iterate 2' is used?",
    "answer": "The total simulation time will be calculated as `1*Dt + 2*Nrestart*Dt`, where `Dt` is the time step size and `Nrestart` is the number of solution restarts specified in the script."
