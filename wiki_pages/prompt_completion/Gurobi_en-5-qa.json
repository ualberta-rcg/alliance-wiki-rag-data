  {
    "question": "How do you activate a Gurobi virtual environment and load necessary modules to run Gurobi in Python?",
    "answer": "You load the `gurobi/11.0.1` and `scipy-stack` modules, then activate the virtual environment using `source ~/env_gurobi/bin/activate`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run Gurobi Python example scripts within an activated virtual environment?",
    "answer": "Once the virtual environment is activated, you can run example scripts using `python $EBROOTGUROBI/examples/python/matrix1.py`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can custom Python scripts using Gurobi be executed as jobs in the queue?",
    "answer": "Custom Python scripts, like `my_gurobi_script.py`, can be run as batch jobs by writing and submitting Slurm scripts that load your virtual environment, using `sbatch my_slurm_script.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical Slurm directives and module loads for a Gurobi Python job in a virtual environment?",
    "answer": "A typical Slurm script includes directives like `--account`, `--time`, `--nodes`, `--cpus-per-task`, `--mem`, and loads `StdEnv/2023` and `gurobi/11.0.1` (optionally `scipy-stack`). It also activates the virtual environment and sets Gurobi threads."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are CPU threads configured for a Gurobi Python job submitted via a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The number of CPU threads for a Gurobi Python job is configured by dynamically generating a `gurobi.env` file with the line `echo \"Threads ${SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE:-1}\" > gurobi.env`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to use Gurobi with Java?",
    "answer": "To use Gurobi with Java, you need to load a Java module and add an option to your Java command (`-Djava.library.path=$EBROOTGUROBI/lib`) to allow the Java virtual environment to locate the Gurobi libraries."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example of a Slurm script for running a Gurobi Java application?",
    "answer": "A sample Slurm script named `gurobi-java.sh` includes loading `java/14.0.2` and `gurobi/9.1.2`, and then running the Java application with `java -Djava.library.path=$EBROOTGUROBI/lib -Xmx4g -jar my_java_file.jar`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find resources and modeling examples for using Gurobi with Jupyter notebooks?",
    "answer": "You can find resources by visiting Gurobi's 'Resources' page, then clicking 'Code and Modeling Examples' and 'Optimization with Python \u2013 Jupyter Notebook Modeling Examples'. Alternatively, search 'Jupyter Notebooks' on `support.gurobi.com`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a video demonstration available for using Gurobi with Jupyter notebooks on the systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, a demo case can be found in a video recording at the 38:28 mark, accessible via `https://youtu.be/Qk3Le5HBxeg?t=2310`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I cite Gurobi software for an academic publication?",
    "answer": "You can find information on how to cite Gurobi software for an academic publication by visiting `https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013195592-How-do-I-cite-Gurobi-software-for-an-academic-publication-`."
