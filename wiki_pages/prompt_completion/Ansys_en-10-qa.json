    "question": "What is the primary purpose of Fluent journal files?",
    "answer": "Fluent journal files allow users to include Text-User-Interface (TUI) commands to change simulation parameters, enabling a series of simulations to be run under different conditions with a single case file."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more detailed information and a list of all commands usable in Fluent journal files?",
    "answer": "Users should refer to the Fluent User's Guide for more information and a comprehensive list of commands."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure a Fluent journal file to use the legacy .cas/.dat file format?",
    "answer": "To use the legacy .cas/.dat file format (default in module versions 2019R3 or older), include the command `/file/cff-files no` in your journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure a Fluent journal file to use the more efficient .cas.h5/.dat.h5 file format?",
    "answer": "To use the more efficient .cas.h5/.dat.h5 file format (default in module versions 2020R1 or newer), include the command `/file/cff-files yes` in your journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command prevents Fluent from asking for confirmation before overwriting files in a journal script?",
    "answer": "The command `/file/confirm-overwrite no` can be used to prevent Fluent from prompting for confirmation before overwriting files by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify the number of iterations for the solver in a steady Fluent simulation journal file?",
    "answer": "To run the solver for a specific number of iterations, use the command `/solve/iterate [number_of_iterations]`, for example, `/solve/iterate 1000`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an optional simulation report be generated and saved to a file from a Fluent journal script?",
    "answer": "To write a simulation report to a file, use the command `/report/summary y \"[filename.txt]\"`, for example, `/report/summary y \"My_Simulation_Report.txt\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to cleanly shut down Fluent from within a journal file?",
    "answer": "The command `/exit` is used to cleanly shut down Fluent from a journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you set up automatic saving of data files every specific number of iterations in a Fluent journal file?",
    "answer": "To write a data file every X iterations, use the command `/file/auto-save/data-frequency X`, for example, `/file/auto-save/data-frequency 100`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can Fluent be configured to retain only the most recent auto-saved data files in a journal file?",
    "answer": "To retain only the most recent data files (e.g., 5), use the command `/file/auto-save/retain-most-recent-files y` along with auto-save frequency settings."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a transient Fluent simulation journal file, how is the physical time step size set?",
    "answer": "The physical time step size in a transient simulation can be set using the command `/solve/set/time-step [time_step_value]`, for example, `/solve/set/time-step 0.0001`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command initializes a transient Fluent simulation using the hybrid initialization method in a journal file?",
    "answer": "To initialize a transient simulation using the hybrid initialization method, include the command `/solve/initialize/hyb-initialization` in the journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the maximum number of iterations per time step and the total number of time steps be specified in a transient Fluent journal file?",
    "answer": "The command `/solve/dual-time-iterate [total_time_steps] [max_iterations_per_time_step]` is used, for example, `/solve/dual-time-iterate 1000 75`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the initial step for using a User-Defined Function (UDF) on a cluster?",
    "answer": "The first step is to transfer your UDF source file (e.g., `sampleudf.c`) and any additional dependency files to the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an important consideration when transferring UDF source files from a Windows machine to a Linux cluster?",
    "answer": "When uploading from a Windows machine, ensure the text mode setting of your transfer client is used; otherwise, Fluent may not be able to read the file properly on the Linux cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should UDF source files be placed on the cluster?",
    "answer": "The UDF should be placed in the same directory where your journal, cas, and dat files reside."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should UDF commands be added to the journal file?",
    "answer": "UDF commands should be added into your journal file before the commands that read in your simulation cas/dat files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be checked in the Fluent GUI before uploading a CAS file to the Alliance to ensure journal file commands control UDFs?",
    "answer": "Before uploading your CAS file, ensure that neither the Interpreted UDFs Dialog Box nor the UDF Library Manager Dialog Box are configured to use any UDF in the Fluent GUI, so that only the journal file commands control UDFs when jobs are submitted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you tell Fluent to interpret a UDF at runtime using a journal file command?",
    "answer": "To tell Fluent to interpret your UDF at runtime, add the command `define/user-defined/interpreted-functions \"sampleudf.c\" \"cpp\" 10000 no` to your journal file, replacing `sampleudf.c` with your actual source file name."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the command for interpreting a UDF differ based on whether the Fluent simulation is run in serial or parallel?",
    "answer": "No, the command for interpreting a UDF remains the same regardless of whether the simulation is being run in serial or parallel."
  },
  {
    "question": "What action can ensure an interpreted UDF is found in the same directory as the journal file?",
    "answer": "To ensure the UDF can be found, open your cas file in the Fluent GUI, remove any managed definitions, and then resave it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is necessary for an interpreted UDF to be used effectively with parallel jobs?",
    "answer": "To use an interpreted UDF with parallel jobs, it will need to be parallelized as described in the relevant section of the documentation."
