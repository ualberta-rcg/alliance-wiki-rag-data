    "answer": "The root name and output directory for auto-saved data files are specified using `/file/auto-save/root-name output/FFF-out` in a Fluent journal file, which will append the iteration number to the filename within the `output` subdirectory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to read an input case file for a transient simulation in Fluent?",
    "answer": "The command `/file/read-case FFF-transient-inp` is used to read an input case file for a transient simulation in Fluent, where `FFF-transient-inp` is the filename."

  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial steps for using a User-Defined Function (UDF) on a cluster?",
    "answer": "The initial steps involve transferring your UDF source file (e.g., `sampleudf.c`) and any dependency files to the cluster using text mode setting if from Windows, placing it in the same directory as journal, cas, and dat files, and adding a UDF command to your journal file before reading cas/dat files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be checked in the Fluent GUI before uploading a .cas file when using UDFs with a journal file?",
    "answer": "Before uploading a .cas file, ensure that neither the Interpreted UDFs Dialog Box nor the UDF Library Manager Dialog Box in the Fluent GUI are configured to use any UDF; this ensures that only the journal file commands control UDF usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you tell Fluent to interpret a UDF at runtime using a journal file command?",
    "answer": "To tell Fluent to interpret a UDF at runtime, add the command `define/user-defined/interpreted-functions \"sampleudf.c\" \"cpp\" 10000 no` to your journal file before the cas/dat files are read or initialized, replacing `sampleudf.c` with your source file name."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required for an interpreted UDF to be used with parallel Fluent jobs?",
    "answer": "To use an interpreted UDF with parallel Fluent jobs, it will need to be parallelized as described in the 'Parallel' section of the documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary requirement for using a compiled UDF on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "A compiled UDF must be compiled on an Alliance cluster at least once, which creates a `libudf` subdirectory containing the necessary `libudf.so` shared library."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a `libudf` directory created by compiling a UDF on a local laptop be copied and used directly on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "No, a `libudf` directory cannot simply be copied from a remote system (such as your laptop) to the Alliance, as the shared library's dependencies will not be satisfied, leading to Fluent crashing."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what conditions can a compiled `libudf` directory be transferred between Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "Once a UDF has been compiled on one Alliance cluster, its `libudf` directory can be transferred to any other Alliance cluster, provided your account loads the same `StdEnv` environment module version."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command should be added to a journal file to compile a UDF?",
    "answer": "To compile a UDF using a journal file, add the command `define/user-defined/compiled-functions compile libudf yes sampleudf.c \"\" \"\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command should be added to a journal file to load an already compiled UDF?",
    "answer": "To load an already compiled UDF using a journal file, add the command `define/user-defined/compiled-functions load libudf`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should both compile and load commands not be uncommented in the journal file for a compiled UDF?",
    "answer": "Leaving both compile and load commands uncommented is highly inefficient as the UDF will be recompiled for every job, potentially leading to build conflicts if multiple jobs run from the same directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are involved in parallelizing a UDF for Fluent parallel jobs?",
    "answer": "Parallelizing a UDF involves adding compiler directives, predicates, and reduction macros into the working serial UDF, as detailed in *Part I: Chapter 7: Parallel Considerations* of the Ansys 2024 *Fluent Customization Manual*."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can detailed information about parallelizing UDFs be found?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What journal command enables updating DPM source terms every flow iteration?",
    "answer": "The journal command `/define/models/dpm/interaction/coupled-calculations yes` enables updating DPM source terms every flow iteration."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example of a journal command sequence to create and list a DPM injection from a file.",
    "answer": "An example journal command sequence is:\n`/define/models/dpm/injections/delete-injection injection-0:1`\n`/define/models/dpm/injections/create injection-0:1 no yes file no zinjection01.inj no no no no`\n`/define/models/dpm/injections/list-particles injection-0:1`\n`/define/models/dpm/injections/list-injection-properties injection-0:1`"
