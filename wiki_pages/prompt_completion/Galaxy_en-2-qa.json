  },
  {
    "question": "Why is running jobs locally on the gateway machine not recommended?",
    "answer": "Running jobs on the gateway machine is not recommended due to limited memory and inefficiency."

  {
    "question": "Why might a user need to adjust the `job_conf.xml` file?",
    "answer": "You may need to adjust the `job_conf.xml` file based on tool requirements, particularly for memory allocation and walltime limits; optimizing these values is crucial to ensure tools run efficiently and do not fail due to resource constraints."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended to determine the appropriate memory and walltime for a Galaxy tool?",
    "answer": "Perform test runs to determine the appropriate memory and walltime for each tool."
