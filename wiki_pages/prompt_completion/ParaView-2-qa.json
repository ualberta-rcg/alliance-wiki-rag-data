    "question": "What are the essential JupyterHub Server Options settings for performing single-core remote visualization?",
    "answer": "For single-core remote visualization, you must select a CPU account (not GPUs), set GPU configuration to 'None', choose '1' for Number of Cores, specify the Time required for the session, set Memory based on your data size, and select 'JupyterLab' for the User interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "After configuring JupyterHub, how long should I wait for the JupyterLab dashboard to appear?",
    "answer": "You should wait about one minute for the job to start and the JupyterLab dashboard to appear in your browser."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is one way to launch ParaView interactively for single-core visualization after the JupyterLab dashboard is ready?",
    "answer": "One way is to load the `boost/1.85.0` and `paraview/6.0.0` modules under 'Software Modules' on the left-hand side, then click the 'ParaView (VNC)' button that appears. If it doesn't start automatically, a shortcut should be on the virtual desktop."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an alternative method to launch ParaView in a single-core JupyterLab session using a terminal?",
    "answer": "Alternatively, you can click on your preferred 'Desktop' button to open a virtual desktop session. Inside this virtual desktop, open a terminal and type `module load boost/1.85.0 paraview/6.0.0` followed by `paraview`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the ParaView GUI application utilize multiple CPU cores directly for rendering?",
    "answer": "No, the ParaView GUI application itself is single-threaded and cannot directly use multiple cores. However, some filters do support multithreading."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can true parallel rendering be achieved with ParaView on the clusters?",
    "answer": "For true parallel rendering, you need to connect the single-core ParaView client to a parallel ParaView server, both of which can be launched within a JupyterLab session."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key differences in JupyterHub Server Options settings when configuring for multi-core visualization compared to single-core?",
    "answer": "For multi-core visualization, you'll select your desired 'Number of Cores' (e.g., 4) and scale your 'Memory' request accordingly (e.g., 14400 MB for 4 cores, based on 3600 MB per core)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start a parallel ParaView server within a multi-core JupyterLab session?",
    "answer": "After opening your preferred virtual desktop and a terminal, first load the modules with `module load boost/1.85.0 paraview/6.0.0`. Then, start the server by typing `mpirun --oversubscribe -np 4 pvserver` (replacing 4 with your desired core count)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are required in the ParaView GUI to connect to a remote parallel server running in a JupyterLab session?",
    "answer": "In the ParaView GUI, click the 'Connect' button, then 'Add Server'. Select 'Client/Server' as the Server Type, set 'Host' to `localhost`, 'Port' to `11111` (or the port shown in the server's Connection URL), and 'Startup Type' to 'Manual'. Finally, click 'Connect' again to establish the connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one confirm that parallel rendering is active when visualizing a dataset in ParaView?",
    "answer": "You can confirm parallel rendering is active by coloring your dataset by the `Process Id` variable, which is only available when running in parallel and not in serial."
