    "question": "How are hours calculated from the total estimated time in the fdtd-process-template.sh script?",
    "answer": "Hours are calculated by dividing the total estimated time (`TIME`) by 3600 using the formula `HOUR=$((TIME / 3600))`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are minutes and seconds derived after calculating the hours in the fdtd-process-template.sh script?",
    "answer": "First, `MINSEC` is calculated as the remainder of `TIME` after subtracting the hours (`MINSEC=$((TIME - HOUR * 3600))`). Then, `MIN` is derived by dividing `MINSEC` by 60 (`MIN=$((MINSEC / 60))`), and `SEC` is the remainder of `MINSEC` after subtracting the minutes (`SEC=$((MINSEC - MIN * 60))`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What value is echoed as output by the fdtd-process-template.sh script before performing replacements?",
    "answer": "The script echoes the `TOTALMEM` value."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which tokens are replaced in the template file by the sed command in fdtd-process-template.sh?",
    "answer": "The `sed` command replaces the following tokens: `<total_memory>`, `<processor_memory>`, `<hours>`, `<minutes>`, `<seconds>`, `<n>`, `<dir_fsp>`, and `<filename>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What variables correspond to the tokens replaced in the template by fdtd-process-template.sh?",
    "answer": "The tokens correspond to the following variables: `<total_memory>` to `TOTALMEM`, `<processor_memory>` to `PROCMEM`, `<hours>` to `HOUR`, `<minutes>` to `MIN`, `<seconds>` to `SEC`, `<n>` to `PROCS`, `<dir_fsp>` to `DIRFSP`, and `<filename>` to `FILENAME`."
