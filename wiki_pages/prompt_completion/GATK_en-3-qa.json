    "question": "What is the common error message when GATK subprograms require more memory?",
    "answer": "The common error message is `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you address a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error in GATK?",
    "answer": "To address this error, you should add the `-Xms` command or increase the memory specified with `-Xmx` in the `--java-options` argument. For example, `gatk MarkDuplicates --java-options \"-Xmx8G DGATK_STACKTRACE_ON_USER_EXCEPTION=true\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended if increasing heap memory doesn't resolve the `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error?",
    "answer": "If increasing heap memory doesn't fix the error, especially with non-model organisms and too many scaffolds, it's recommended to remove small scaffolds, create subsets of the reference, and run pipelines on each subset. However, this approach does not work for all pipelines and results should be reviewed carefully."

    "question": "Why might GATK/JAVA applications use more resources than requested?",
    "answer": "GATK/JAVA applications might use more memory or CPUs/threads than requested due to the JAVA garbage collection process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you control GATK/JAVA applications from using more resources than requested due to garbage collection?",
    "answer": "To control this, add `-XX:ConcGCThreads=1` to the `--java-options` argument."
