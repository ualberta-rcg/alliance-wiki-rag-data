  {
    "question": "What is /dev/shm on Niagara nodes?",
    "answer": "/dev/shm is a ramdisk available on the Niagara nodes, which functions as a temporary local filesystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much RAM can be utilized for /dev/shm?",
    "answer": "Up to 70 percent of the RAM on the node, equivalent to 202GB, may be used as a temporary local filesystem via /dev/shm."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the performance of ramdisk (/dev/shm) compare to other storage options on Niagara?",
    "answer": "Ramdisk is much faster than real disk and also faster than the Burst Buffer."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is /dev/shm particularly useful on Niagara?",
    "answer": "It is particularly useful in the early stages of migrating desktop-computing codes to a HPC platform like Niagara, especially for those applications that use a lot of file I/O (Input/Output)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is high I/O a bottleneck on parallel filesystems like GPFS?",
    "answer": "Using a lot of I/O is a bottleneck on parallel filesystems such as the GPFS used on Niagara because the files are synchronized across the whole network."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the environment variable $SLURM_TMPDIR point to on Niagara compute jobs?",
    "answer": "On Niagara compute jobs, the environment variable $SLURM_TMPDIR will point to RAMdisk, not to local hard drives."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the lifecycle of the $SLURM_TMPDIR directory during a job?",
    "answer": "The $SLURM_TMPDIR directory will be empty when your job starts and its content gets deleted after the job has finished."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does $SLURM_TMPDIR on Niagara differ from general purpose Compute Canada systems like Cedar and Graham?",
    "answer": "On Niagara, $SLURM_TMPDIR lives in memory (ramdisk) because compute nodes have no local disks, in contrast to Cedar and Graham where this variable points to a directory on a node-local SSD disk."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the ways to use ramdisk on Niagara?",
    "answer": "To use ramdisk, you can either directly access /dev/shm or use the environment variable $SLURM_TMPDIR."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is $BB_JOB_DIR on Niagara?",
    "answer": "$BB_JOB_DIR is a temporary directory created by the scheduler on the burst buffer for every job on Niagara."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the content of the $BB_JOB_DIR directory deleted?",
    "answer": "The content of the $BB_JOB_DIR directory gets deleted after the job has finished; it will be empty when your job starts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is $BB_JOB_DIR accessible from all nodes of a job?",
    "answer": "Yes, the $BB_JOB_DIR directory is accessible from all nodes of a job."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what kind of applications is $BB_JOB_DIR intended?",
    "answer": "$BB_JOB_DIR is intended for applications that generate many small temporary files or that create files that are accessed very frequently (i.e., high IOPS applications), but that do not fit in ramdisk."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which is generally a better location for temporary files, ramdisk or burst buffer, if the files fit?",
    "answer": "If temporary files fit in ramdisk, then that is generally a better location for them as both the bandwidth and IOPS of ramdisk far exceed that of the burst buffer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the per-user quota for the $HOME filesystem?",
    "answer": "The per-user quota for the $HOME filesystem is 100 GB."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the $HOME filesystem backed up?",
    "answer": "Yes, the $HOME filesystem is backed up."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the accessibility of $HOME on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "$HOME is read-only on the compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the block size for $HOME?",
    "answer": "The block size for $HOME is 1 MB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default individual user quota for $SCRATCH?",
    "answer": "The default individual user quota for $SCRATCH is 25 TB, provided the group quota is not reached."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the block size for $SCRATCH and $PROJECT?",
    "answer": "The block size for both $SCRATCH and $PROJECT is 16 MB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the expiration time for files on $SCRATCH?",
    "answer": "Files on $SCRATCH have an expiration time of 2 months."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is $SCRATCH backed up?",
    "answer": "No, $SCRATCH is not backed up."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some group quotas for $SCRATCH?",
    "answer": "Group quotas for $SCRATCH include 50TB for groups of up to 4 users, 125TB for groups of up to 11 users, and up to 500TB for groups with over 60 users."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the quota for $PROJECT determined?",
    "answer": "The quota for $PROJECT is determined by group allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is $PROJECT backed up?",
    "answer": "Yes, $PROJECT is backed up."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of backup does $ARCHIVE utilize?",
    "answer": "$ARCHIVE utilizes a dual-copy backup."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is $ARCHIVE accessible on login or compute nodes?",
    "answer": "No, $ARCHIVE is not accessible on login or compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the per-user quota for $BBUFFER?",
    "answer": "The per-user quota for $BBUFFER is 10 TB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the block size for $BBUFFER?",
    "answer": "The block size for $BBUFFER is 1 MB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the expiration time for files on $BBUFFER?",
    "answer": "Files on $BBUFFER have a very short expiration time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are compute nodes on Niagara equipped with local storage?",
    "answer": "No, compute nodes on Niagara do not have local storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'backed up' mean in the context of SciNet filesystems?",
    "answer": "'Backed up' means a recent snapshot, not an archive of all data that ever was."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does $BBUFFER stand for and what is its purpose?",
    "answer": "$BBUFFER stands for Burst Buffer, which is a faster parallel storage tier for temporary data."
