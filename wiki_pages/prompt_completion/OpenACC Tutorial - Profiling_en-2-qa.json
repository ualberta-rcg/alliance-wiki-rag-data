    "question": "What optimization was reported for a loop that was \"completely unrolled\" in the compiler feedback?",
    "answer": "The loop was \"unrolled 3 times (completely unrolled)\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the compiler feedback, what prevented a loop from being fused due to a function call?",
    "answer": "The loop was \"not fused: function call before adjacent loop\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why did the compiler report that a loop was not vectorized?",
    "answer": "The compiler reported \"Loop not vectorized: data dependency\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the inlined size of the `allocate_vector` function?",
    "answer": "The `allocate_vector` function was inlined with a size of 3 from `main.cpp` (line 24)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the reported computational intensity for `initialize_vector` when inlined from `main.cpp` line 34?",
    "answer": "The intensity was 0.0 for `initialize_vector` when inlined."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which specific idiom replaced the loop for `initialize_vector` when its intensity was 0.0?",
    "answer": "The \"Memory set idiom\" replaced the loop, which was then replaced by a call to `__c_mset8`."
  },
  {
    "question": "For the `waxpby` function at `main.cpp` line 33, what idiom replaced its loop when it was inlined and reported an intensity of 0.0?",
    "answer": "The \"Memory copy idiom\" replaced the loop for `waxpby`, resulting in a call to `__c_mcopy8`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the compiler's advice when the `matvec` function's intensity was reported as symbolic at line 29?",
    "answer": "The compiler suggested trying the `-Mpfi -Mpfo` options."
  },
  {
    "question": "What reason prevented a `matvec` loop from being fused, according to the compiler feedback?",
    "answer": "The loop was \"not fused: different loop trip count\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "What optimization was applied to a loop containing reductions within the `matvec` function?",
    "answer": "\"Generated vector simd code for the loop containing reductions\" was applied."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of instructions were generated at lines 27 and 36 for the `waxpby` function?",
    "answer": "\"FMA (fused multiply-add) instruction(s) generated\" at both lines."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the intensity reported for the `waxpby` function at line 39, and how many times was its loop unrolled?",
    "answer": "The intensity was 0.67, and the \"Loop unrolled 4 times\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "For the `dot` function, what was the reported intensity for a loop that generated vector SIMD code for reductions?",
    "answer": "The intensity was 1.00 for such a loop."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was another reason, besides a function call, why a `dot` function loop was not fused?",
    "answer": "The loop was \"not fused: different controlling conditions\"."
