    "question": "How do you extract a ZIP archive to $SLURM_TMPDIR in a multinode job?",
    "answer": "Use the command `srun --ntasks=$SLURM_NNODES --ntasks-per-node=1 unzip archive.zip -d $SLURM_TMPDIR` to extract a ZIP archive to $SLURM_TMPDIR on every node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a Tarball archive to $SLURM_TMPDIR in a multinode job?",
    "answer": "To extract a Tarball archive to $SLURM_TMPDIR on every node, use the command `srun --ntasks=$SLURM_NNODES --ntasks-per-node=1 tar -xvf archive.tar.gz -C $SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is $SLURM_TMPDIR implemented on Trillium?",
    "answer": "On Trillium, $SLURM_TMPDIR is implemented as RAMdisk."
  },
  {
    "question": "What limits the amount of space in $SLURM_TMPDIR on Trillium?",
    "answer": "The amount of space available in $SLURM_TMPDIR on Trillium is limited by the node's memory, minus the RAM used by your application."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is $SLURM_TMPDIR space determined on general-purpose clusters?",
    "answer": "On general-purpose clusters, the amount of space available in $SLURM_TMPDIR depends on the specific cluster and the node assigned to your job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the available space in $SLURM_TMPDIR on the Fir cluster?",
    "answer": "The Fir cluster offers 7TB of space in $SLURM_TMPDIR."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the available space in $SLURM_TMPDIR on the Narval cluster?",
    "answer": "The Narval cluster offers 800GB of space in $SLURM_TMPDIR."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the available space in $SLURM_TMPDIR on the Nibi cluster?",
    "answer": "The Nibi cluster offers 3TB of space in $SLURM_TMPDIR."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the available space in $SLURM_TMPDIR on the Rorqual cluster?",
    "answer": "The Rorqual cluster offers 375GB of space in $SLURM_TMPDIR."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to $SLURM_TMPDIR space if a job reserves whole nodes?",
    "answer": "If a job reserves whole nodes, you can reasonably assume that the listed amount of space for $SLURM_TMPDIR is available to you on each node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can other jobs reduce the space available in $SLURM_TMPDIR for a job requesting less than a whole node?",
    "answer": "Yes, if a job requests less than a whole node, other jobs might write to the same filesystem (though to a different directory), thereby reducing the space available to your job in $SLURM_TMPDIR."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find more detailed guidance on local disk space for specific clusters?",
    "answer": "More detailed guidance can be found under 'Node characteristics' on the appropriate cluster's page, such as Fir, Narval, Nibi, or Rorqual, as some nodes have more local disk than shown in the general table."
