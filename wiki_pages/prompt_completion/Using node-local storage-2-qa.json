    "question": "How do you extract a ZIP archive to the `SLURM_TMPDIR` on all nodes in a multinode job?",
    "answer": "To extract a ZIP archive to the `SLURM_TMPDIR` on every allocated node, use the command: `srun --ntasks=$SLURM_NNODES --ntasks-per-node=1 unzip archive.zip -d $SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to extract a tarball to the `SLURM_TMPDIR` for a multinode job?",
    "answer": "You can extract a tarball to the `SLURM_TMPDIR` on all nodes using the command: `srun --ntasks=$SLURM_NNODES --ntasks-per-node=1 tar -xvf archive.tar.gz -C $SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is `SLURM_TMPDIR` implemented at Niagara, and what limits its available space?",
    "answer": "At Niagara, `SLURM_TMPDIR` is implemented as a RAMdisk, and the amount of space available is limited by the memory on the node, less the amount of RAM used by your application."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the available space in `SLURM_TMPDIR` determined at general-purpose clusters?",
    "answer": "At general-purpose clusters, the amount of space available in `SLURM_TMPDIR` depends on the specific cluster and the node to which your job is assigned."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `SLURM_TMPDIR` space available on the smallest node at B\u00e9luga?",
    "answer": "On the smallest node at B\u00e9luga, 370G of space is available in `SLURM_TMPDIR`, out of a total disk size of 480G."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much `SLURM_TMPDIR` space is available on the smallest node at Cedar?",
    "answer": "The smallest node at Cedar has 840G of space in `SLURM_TMPDIR`, with a total disk size of 960G."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `SLURM_TMPDIR` space available on the smallest node at Graham?",
    "answer": "On the smallest node at Graham, 750G of space is available in `SLURM_TMPDIR`, with a total disk size of 960G."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much `SLURM_TMPDIR` space is available on the smallest node at Narval?",
    "answer": "The smallest node at Narval has 800G of space in `SLURM_TMPDIR`, with a total disk size of 960G."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a job reserves whole nodes, what can be assumed about the `SLURM_TMPDIR` space?",
    "answer": "If your job reserves whole nodes, you can reasonably assume that the amount of space listed for the smallest node in the table (e.g., 370G for B\u00e9luga) is available to you in `SLURM_TMPDIR` on each node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to `SLURM_TMPDIR` space if a job requests less than a whole node?",
    "answer": "If a job requests less than a whole node, other jobs might also write to the same filesystem (but a different directory), which can reduce the space available to your job."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find information about nodes with more local disk space than listed in the general table?",
    "answer": "Users can find guidance on nodes with more local disk by checking the 'Node characteristics' section on the appropriate cluster's page (B\u00e9luga, Cedar, Graham, Narval)."
