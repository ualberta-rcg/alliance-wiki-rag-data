    "question": "How do you unload an extension for the current Workbench session only?",
    "answer": "Click to un-highlight the extension's box (e.g., AdditiveWizard) in the Extension Manager."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you prevent an extension from loading in future Workbench sessions?",
    "answer": "Click the lower right corner arrow in the extension's box (e.g., AdditiveWizard) and select 'Do not load as default'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum number of cores a user can utilize for a single Ansys Additive Manufacturing job on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "A user can run a single Ansys Additive Manufacturing job on gra-vdi with up to 16 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to run an Ansys Additive Manufacturing job on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "First, start Workbench on Gra-vdi as described in the 'Enable Additive' section. Then, click 'File -> Open' and select 'test.wbpj'. If a grey screen appears, click 'View -> reset workspace'. Next, start Mechanical, clear generated data, tick 'Distributed', specify the desired number of cores, and finally click 'File -> Save Project -> Solve'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check the resource utilization of an Ansys Additive job on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To check resource utilization, open another terminal and run either `top -u $USER` or `ps u -u $USER | grep ansys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to terminate rogue Ansys processes on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "You can terminate rogue processes by running `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE\"` in a terminal window."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can cause rogue Ansys processes to persist on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Rogue processes can occur if an Ansys GUI session (like Fluent or Workbench) is not cleanly terminated by the user before vncviewer is terminated, either manually or unexpectedly due to issues like a transient network outage or a hung filesystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What preparations are necessary before submitting a newly uploaded Additive project to a cluster queue?",
    "answer": "You must open your simulation with Workbench GUI in the same directory from which your job will be submitted, save it again using the same Ansys module version, and then create a Slurm script as explained in the 'Cluster Batch Job Submission - WORKBENCH' section."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you perform parametric studies for an Additive project using a Slurm script on a cluster?",
    "answer": "To perform parametric studies, you need to change `Update()` to `UpdateAllDesignPoints()` within your Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users avoid manually clearing the solution and recreating design points between test runs on a cluster?",
    "answer": "Users can either change `Save(Overwrite=True)` to `Save(Overwrite=False)` in their Slurm script, or save a copy of the original `YOURPROJECT.wbpj` file and its corresponding `YOURPROJECT_files` directory and restore them after each run."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a single replay file be used in different directories for cluster jobs?",
