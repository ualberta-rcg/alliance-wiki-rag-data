  {
    "question": "How can the AdditiveWizard extension be loaded for the current Ansys Workbench session only?",
    "answer": "To load the AdditiveWizard extension for the current session only, click to highlight the AdditiveWizard box in the Extension Manager."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the AdditiveWizard extension be loaded for current and future Ansys Workbench sessions?",
    "answer": "To load the AdditiveWizard extension for current and future sessions, click the lower right corner arrow in the AdditiveWizard box and select 'Load extension'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the AdditiveWizard extension be unloaded for the current Ansys Workbench session only?",
    "answer": "To unload the AdditiveWizard extension for the current session only, click to un-highlight the AdditiveWizard box in the Extension Manager."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the AdditiveWizard extension be prevented from loading by default in future Ansys Workbench sessions?",
    "answer": "To prevent the AdditiveWizard extension from loading by default in future sessions, click the lower right corner arrow in the AdditiveWizard box and select 'Do not load as default'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum number of cores a user can use for a single Ansys Additive Manufacturing job on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "A user can run a single Ansys Additive Manufacturing job on gra-vdi with up to 16 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to run an Ansys Additive Manufacturing job on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To run an Ansys Additive Manufacturing job on gra-vdi, first start Workbench as described in the 'Enable Additive' section, then open your project file (e.g., `test.wbpj`), reset the workspace if the screen is grey, start Mechanical, clear generated data, tick 'Distributed', specify cores, and finally click 'File -> Save Project -> Solve'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you check resource utilization for an Ansys Additive Manufacturing job running on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To check resource utilization, open another terminal and run either `top -u $USER` or `ps u -u $USER | grep ansys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can rogue Ansys processes on gra-vdi be terminated?",
    "answer": "Rogue Ansys processes can be terminated by running `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE\"` in a terminal. If connecting via VNC, ensure you are on the correct gra-vdi node (e.g., `gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca` or `gra-vdi4.sharcnet.ca`) before running the command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the project preparation steps before submitting an Ansys Additive Manufacturing job to a cluster queue?",
    "answer": "Before submitting an Additive project to a cluster queue, open the simulation with Workbench GUI in the job submission directory, save it again using the same Ansys module version, and create a Slurm script. For parametric studies, change `Update()` to `UpdateAllDesignPoints()` in the Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you perform parametric studies for Ansys Additive Manufacturing jobs on a cluster?",
    "answer": "To perform parametric studies, you need to change `Update()` to `UpdateAllDesignPoints()` in your Slurm script for the Workbench job submission."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I prevent the solution from being manually cleared and design points recreated between test runs for Ansys Additive Manufacturing on a cluster?",
    "answer": "To avoid manually clearing the solution and recreating design points for test runs, you can either change `Save(Overwrite=True)` to `Save(Overwrite=False)` in your Slurm script, or save a copy of the original `.wbpj` file and its corresponding `_files` directory and restore them after each run."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run a replay file for Ansys Additive Manufacturing on a cluster?",
    "answer": "To run a replay file on a cluster, load the Ansys module (e.g., `module load ansys/2019R3`), remove any lock files (e.g., `rm -f test_files/.lock`), and then execute `runwb2 -R myreplay.wbjn`. The replay file's internal `FilePath` setting can be changed in a text editor to use it in different directories."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can resource utilization for an Ansys Additive Manufacturing job running on a cluster be checked?",
    "answer": "Resource utilization for a running Additive job on a cluster can be obtained by running `srun --jobid=myjobid top -bn1 -u $USER | grep R | grep -v top`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are scaling tests performed for Ansys Additive Manufacturing jobs on a cluster?",
    "answer": "To perform scaling tests, after a job completes, obtain its 'Job Wall-clock time' using `seff myjobid`. Then, submit short test jobs with an increasing number of cores. If the Wall-clock time decreases by approximately 50% when the number of cores is doubled, additional cores may be considered optimal."
