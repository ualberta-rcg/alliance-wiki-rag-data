    "question": "What is the primary function of the 'komplexity' tool?",
    "answer": "Komplexity is a command-line tool built in Rust to quickly calculate and/or mask low-complexity sequences from FAST[A/Q] files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does 'komplexity' determine sequence complexity?",
    "answer": "Komplexity assesses complexity by using the number of unique k-mers over a sequence divided by its length."
  },

  {
    "question": "What is 'krakenuniq' designed to do?",
    "answer": "KrakenUniq is a metagenomics classifier that combines fast k-mer-based classification with an efficient algorithm for assessing the coverage of unique k-mers found in each species in a dataset."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does 'krakenuniq' improve upon previous metagenomics classifiers?",
    "answer": "KrakenUniq provides better recall and precision than other methods, effectively classifies and distinguishes pathogens with low abundance from false positives, and runs as fast as Kraken with little additional memory due to HyperLogLog."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the listed version for 'krakenuniq'?",
    "answer": "The listed version for 'krakenuniq' is 1.0.2."
  },
