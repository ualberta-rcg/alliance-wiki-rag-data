    "question": "What are the primary methods for using graphics when testing code on Niagara?",
    "answer": "You can either use the `debugjob` command or follow a multi-step process using the regular queue."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of using the `debugjob` command for graphics?",
    "answer": "The `debugjob` command automatically provides X-forwarding support."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start a session that uses the `debugjob` command with graphics support?",
    "answer": "You first SSH to `niagara.scinet.utoronto.ca` using the `-X` flag, and then execute the `debugjob` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it necessary to use the regular queue method for graphics instead of `debugjob`?",
    "answer": "You should use the regular queue method if `debugjob` is not suitable due to its limitations on time or resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many terminals are needed to set up graphics forwarding using the regular queue method?",
    "answer": "Two terminals are needed for this method."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps for the first terminal when setting up graphics with the regular queue?",
    "answer": "In the first terminal, SSH to `niagara.scinet.utoronto.ca`, issue your `salloc` command to request resources, and then note the assigned head node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps for the second terminal to enable graphics after allocating resources via `salloc`?",
    "answer": "In the second terminal, SSH into `niagara.scinet.utoronto.ca` using the `-X` flag, and then `ssh -X` into the head node (e.g., `niaWXYZ`) that was assigned by `salloc`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you test if graphics forwarding is working correctly on the head node?",
    "answer": "You can test graphics by running the `xclock` command on the head node; a clock window should pop up on your local terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required on a Windows machine to use ssh with X-forwarding?",
    "answer": "A Windows machine needs an X-server, and MobaXterm is recommended as it includes one."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which ssh flag should Mac OS users use instead of `-X` for X-forwarding?",
    "answer": "Mac OS users should substitute `-Y` for the `-X` flag."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there an alternative to using two separate terminals for the regular queue method?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can use the `screen` command to request resources, detach the session, and then SSH into the head node directly with X-forwarding."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example command to allocate 5 nodes for 2 hours using `salloc`?",
    "answer": "An example command is `salloc --nodes 5 --time=2:00:00`."
