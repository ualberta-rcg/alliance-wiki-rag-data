  {
    "question": "Which Python versions are compatible with PyRETIS 2.5.0 as of July 2020?",
    "answer": "As of July 2020, PyRETIS 2.5.0 is compatible with Python versions 3.6 and 3.7."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the correct installation order for PyRETIS and its dependency MDTraj?",
    "answer": "According to the PyRETIS installation instructions, the dependency MDTraj has to be installed after PyRETIS."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load a Python module like python/3.7?",
    "answer": "You load the Python module by running '$ module load python/3.7'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create a virtual Python environment for PyRETIS?",
    "answer": "A virtualenv can be created by running '$ virtualenv --no-download ~/env_PyRETIS'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you activate a PyRETIS virtual environment?",
    "answer": "You activate the virtual environment by running '$ source ~/env_PyRETIS/bin/activate'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to install PyRETIS and MDTraj within an activated virtual environment?",
    "answer": "First, run '(env_PyRETIS) $ pip install --no-index pyretis', and then '(env_PyRETIS) $ pip install --no-index mdtraj'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you run PyRETIS to check its basic functionality after installation?",
    "answer": "You can run PyRETIS by executing '(env_PyRETIS) $ pyretisrun --help' within the activated virtual environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you prepare to use `pyretisrun` in job scripts?",
    "answer": "You only need to activate the module again by running 'source ~/env_PyRETIS/bin/activate' before using 'pyretisrun --input INPUT.rst --log_file LOG_FILE.log'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is PyVisA?",
    "answer": "PyVisA is an analysis tool offered by PyRETIS."
  },
  {
    "question": "What software does PyVisA's GUI require to function?",
    "answer": "PyVisA's GUI requires PyQt5 to be executed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the process to enable the PyRETIS virtual environment to find PyQt5 for PyVisA?",
    "answer": "To allow the Python version from the virtualenv to find PyQt5, it is important to first load the modules for Python and Qt (e.g., '$ module load python/3.7 qt/5.11.3') before activating the PyRETIS virtualenv ('$ source ~/env_PyRETIS/bin/activate')."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more documentation on how to use PyRETIS?",
    "answer": "The usage of PyRETIS is documented on the PyRETIS website at http://www.pyretis.org/."
  },
  {
