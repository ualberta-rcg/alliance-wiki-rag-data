  {
    "question": "What are the four main gene expression pipelines included in Cell Ranger?",
    "answer": "The four main gene expression pipelines in Cell Ranger are: cellranger mkfastq, cellranger count, cellranger aggr, and cellranger reanalyze."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the cellranger mkfastq pipeline?",
    "answer": "The cellranger mkfastq pipeline wraps Illumina's bcl2fastq to correctly demultiplex Chromium-prepared sequencing samples and convert barcode and read data to FASTQ files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the cellranger count pipeline do?",
    "answer": "The cellranger count pipeline takes FASTQ files from cellranger mkfastq and performs alignment, filtering, and UMI counting."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does cellranger aggr process data?",
    "answer": "The cellranger aggr pipeline aggregates outputs from multiple runs of cellranger count, normalizing those runs to the same sequencing depth, and then recomputing the gene-barcode matrices and analysis on the combined data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the cellranger reanalyze pipeline?",
    "answer": "The cellranger reanalyze pipeline takes gene-barcode matrices produced by cellranger count or cellranger aggr and reruns the dimensionality reduction, clustering, and gene expression algorithms using tunable parameter settings."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of aligner does Cell Ranger combine with its algorithms?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger combines Chromium-specific algorithms with the widely used RNA-seq aligner STAR."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what formats is Cell Ranger output delivered?",
    "answer": "Cell Ranger output is delivered in standard BAM, MEX, CSV, HDF5, and HTML formats, augmented with cellular information."

    "answer": "Cell Ranger is classified as 'bio'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is cellsnp-lite?",
    "answer": "cellsnp-lite is a software designed to pileup expressed alleles in single-cell or bulk RNA-seq data, which can be used for donor deconvolution and doublet detection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of cellsnp-lite is available?",
    "answer": "Version 1.2.2 of cellsnp-lite is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of data can cellsnp-lite be applied to?",
    "answer": "Besides RNA-seq data, cellsnp-lite can also be applied to DNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, both in bulk and single-cell formats."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage for cellsnp-lite?",
    "answer": "The homepage for cellsnp-lite is https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/cellsnp-lite."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Centrifuge?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge is a novel microbial classification engine that enables rapid, accurate, and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species on desktop computers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of Centrifuge are listed?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge versions 1.0.4-beta and 1.0.4.2 are listed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Centrifuge achieve high sensitivity and speed for metagenomic classification?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge achieves high sensitivity and high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers and a novel classification algorithm, based on a novel indexing scheme using the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical index size required by Centrifuge for bacterial, viral, and human genomes?",
    "answer": "Centrifuge requires a relatively small index, typically 4.7 GB, for all complete bacterial and viral genomes plus the human genome."
  },
