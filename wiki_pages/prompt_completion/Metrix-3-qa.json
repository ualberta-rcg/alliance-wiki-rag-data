    "question": "What information is presented in the left graph concerning GPU memory?",
    "answer": "The graph on the left indicates the memory used by the GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the graph on the right depict regarding GPU memory access cycles?",
    "answer": "It represents the percentage of cycles during which the device\u2019s memory interface is active for sending or receiving data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the GPU power consumption graph show?",
    "answer": "The GPU power consumption graph displays the evolution of the GPU's energy consumption (in watts) over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of GPU bandwidth is shown in the left graph?",
    "answer": "The left graph shows GPU bandwidth on the PCIe bus (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)."

  {
    "question": "What is NVLink?",
    "answer": "NVLink is a technology developed by NVIDIA to enable ultra-fast communication between multiple GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might full node resource statistics be inaccurate?",
    "answer": "Node-wide resource statistics can be imprecise if the node is shared among several users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the left graph for node resources illustrate?",
    "answer": "The left graph illustrates the evolution of bandwidth used by the task over time, in relation to software, licenses, etc."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the right graph for node resources represent regarding network bandwidth?",
    "answer": "The right graph represents the evolution of network bandwidth used by a task or a set of tasks via the Infiniband network over time, where periods of massive data transfer (e.g., Lustre file system I/O, MPI communication) can be observed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the left graph show for local disk I/O?",
    "answer": "The left graph illustrates the evolution of the number of Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) performed on the local disk over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the right graph show for local disk bandwidth?",
    "answer": "The right graph shows the evolution of bandwidth used on the local disk over time, meaning the amount of data read or written per second."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is represented by the 'Espace utilis\u00e9 sur le disque local' graph?",
    "answer": "It is a graphical representation of the local disk space usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'Puissance utilis\u00e9e' graph represent?",
    "answer": "It is a graphical representation of the power used."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the 'Statistiques d'un compte' (Account Statistics) organized?",
    "answer": "The 'Statistique d'un compte' section groups the utilization of your group into two subsections: CPU and GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information can be found in the CPU Account Statistics section?",
    "answer": "You can find the sum of your group's CPU core requests, their corresponding usage over recent months, and the evolution of your priority, which varies based on your usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'Application used CPU' graph display?",
    "answer": "This graph shows the most commonly used applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users view resource usage by individual group members?",
    "answer": "You can consult the resource usage by each user in your group here."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'Coeur CPU gaspill\u00e9' (Wasted CPU cores) graph show?",
    "answer": "This graph shows the evolution over time of CPU cores wasted by each user in the group."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view memory usage for each user in your group?",
    "answer": "You can view the memory usage by each user in your group here."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'M\u00e9moire gaspill\u00e9e' (Wasted memory) graph represent?",
    "answer": "This graph represents the memory wasted by each user."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is file system activity displayed in the account statistics?",
    "answer": "File system activity is represented by two graphs: the left graph shows the number of disk write commands (IOPS), and the right graph shows the quantity of data transferred to servers over a given period (Bandwidth)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does IOPS stand for in the context of file system activity?",
    "answer": "IOPS stands for input/output operations per second, representing the number of disk write commands performed."
