    "question": "What information do the GPU memory graphs display?",
    "answer": "The left GPU memory graph shows the memory used by the GPU, while the right graph illustrates the percentage of cycles during which the GPU's memory interface is active for sending or receiving data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the GPU power graph indicate?",
    "answer": "The GPU power graph shows the evolution of the GPU's energy consumption, measured in watts, over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is GPU bandwidth presented?",
    "answer": "GPU bandwidth is presented in two graphs: the left one for the PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) bus and the right one for the NVLink bus."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is NVLink technology?",
    "answer": "NVLink is a technology developed by NVIDIA designed to enable ultra-fast communication between multiple GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might node resource statistics be inaccurate?",
    "answer": "Statistics for complete node resources can be imprecise if the node is shared among several users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the left graph for complete node resources show?",
    "answer": "The left graph for complete node resources illustrates the evolution of bandwidth used by the task over time, in relation to software, licenses, and other factors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the right graph for complete node resources (Infiniband) represent?",
    "answer": "The right graph for complete node resources represents the evolution of network bandwidth used by a task or a set of tasks via the Infiniband network over time, allowing observation of periods of massive data transfer such as Lustre read/write operations or MPI communication between nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information do the local disk IOPS and bandwidth graphs provide?",
    "answer": "The left graph illustrates the evolution of the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) performed on the local disk over time. The right graph shows the evolution of bandwidth used on the local disk, indicating the quantity of data read or written per second over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is represented by the 'Espace utilis\u00e9 sur le disque local' graphic?",
    "answer": "This graphic provides a representation of the utilization of local disk space."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is displayed in the 'Puissance utilis\u00e9e' graphic?",
    "answer": "The 'Puissance utilis\u00e9e' graphic shows a representation of the power consumed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are account statistics organized?",
    "answer": "The 'Statistique d'un compte' section groups the usage of a user's group into two subsections: CPU and GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "What details are available in the CPU account statistics regarding CPU core usage?",
    "answer": "In the CPU account statistics, you can find the sum of CPU core requests for your group, their corresponding usage over recent months, and track the evolution of your priority, which adjusts based on your usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find information about the most commonly used applications within a CPU account?",
    "answer": "A dedicated graph in the CPU account statistics shows the most commonly used applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can resource utilization be viewed per individual user in CPU account statistics?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can consult the utilization of resources by each user within your group in the CPU account statistics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'Coeur CPU gaspill\u00e9' graph indicate for a CPU account?",
    "answer": "This graph shows the evolution over time of CPU cores wasted by each user within the group."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can memory usage be monitored for individual users in a CPU account?",
    "answer": "You can consult the memory usage for each user in your group within the CPU account statistics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'M\u00e9moire gaspill\u00e9e' graph represent for a CPU account?",
    "answer": "This graph illustrates the amount of memory wasted by each user in a CPU account."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of file system activity is displayed in the CPU account statistics?",
    "answer": "File system activity in the CPU account statistics includes a left graph showing the number of disk write commands (IOPS) and a right graph displaying the quantity of data transferred to servers (bandwidth) over a given period."
