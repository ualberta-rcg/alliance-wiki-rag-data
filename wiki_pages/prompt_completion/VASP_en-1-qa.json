  },
  {
    "question": "Why can't VASP be installed centrally on the infrastructure?",
    "answer": "VASP's licensing terms, which require it to be licensed to groups hired by a single legal entity, are incompatible with the way the infrastructure operates, and negotiation attempts for a different agreement were unsuccessful."

    "answer": "Users must provide license holder (PI) information (Name, Email address, Department and institution) and license information (VASP version 4, 5 or 6, License number, and an updated list of licensed users)."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I have a VASP version 5 license, can I use VASP version 4?",
    "answer": "Yes, if you are licensed for VASP version 5, you may also use version 4."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I have a VASP version 4 license, can I use VASP version 5?",
    "answer": "No, a VASP version 4 license does not permit you to use version 5."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load VASP 5.4.4 on Fir and Nibi?",
    "answer": "You need to run 'module load StdEnv/2023 intel/2023.2.1 openmpi/4.1.5' followed by 'module load vasp/5.4.4'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load VASP 6.4.2 on Fir and Nibi?",
    "answer": "You need to run 'module load StdEnv/2023 intel/2023.2.1 intelmpi/2021.9.0' followed by 'module load vasp/6.4.2'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I see which VASP versions are available?",
    "answer": "You can run 'module spider vasp' to see which versions are available."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more information about using VASP on Trillium?",
    "answer": "Users should refer to the SciNet VASP wiki page at [https://docs.scinet.utoronto.ca/index.php/VASP]."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are GPU versions of VASP available on Niagara nodes?",
    "answer": "No, GPU versions are not available on Niagara nodes because they do not have GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are pseudopotential files accessed in VASP?",
    "answer": "All pseudopotentials are located in '$EBROOTVASP/pseudopotentials/' on Cedar and Graham and can be accessed once the VASP module is loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the executable files for VASP-4.6?",
    "answer": "For VASP-4.6, the executable files are 'vasp' for standard NVT calculations with non-gamma k points, 'vasp-gamma' for standard NVT calculations with only gamma points, and 'makeparam' to estimate memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which VASP executables are used for standard NVT calculations without CUDA support for versions 5.4.1, 5.4.4 and 6.1.0?",
    "answer": "For standard NVT calculations without CUDA support, 'vasp_std' is used for non-gamma k points and 'vasp_gam' for only gamma points."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which VASP executables support CUDA for versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.0?",
    "answer": "For VASP-5.4.4 and 6.1.0 with CUDA support, 'vasp_gpu' is for standard NVT calculations (gamma and non-gamma k points) and 'vasp_gpu_ncl' for NPT calculations (gamma and non-gamma k points)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What extensions are incorporated into VASP?",
    "answer": "Two incorporated extensions are Transition State Tools (vtsttools) and VASPsol."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended when running Vasp-GPU executable files?",
    "answer": "It is highly recommended to perform a benchmark using one or two GPUs to ensure maximum performance, as GPU calculations are more expensive than CPU calculations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPU cores and how much memory does the example `vasp_job.sh` script request?",
    "answer": "The example `vasp_job.sh` script requests four CPU cores and 4096MB memory (4x1024MB)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the '<ACCOUNT>' field signify in a Slurm job script for VASP?",
    "answer": "'<ACCOUNT>' represents a Slurm account name."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the four essential input files for a VASP job?",
    "answer": "The four essential input files for VASP are INCAR, KPOINTS, POSCAR, and POTCAR."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user estimate the memory required for a VASP job?",
    "answer": "Users can prepare all input files and then run 'makeparam' in an interactive job submission, or check the maximum stack size used by completed jobs for a more accurate estimate."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users build VASP themselves using EasyBuild?",
    "answer": "Users can build VASP using the EasyBuild command 'eb -f [RECIPE NAME] --sourcepath=[SOURCEPATH]', where [SOURCEPATH] is the directory containing the VASP source code."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can VASP source code be downloaded from?",
    "answer": "The VASP source code can be downloaded from the official VASP website ([https://www.vasp.at/])."
