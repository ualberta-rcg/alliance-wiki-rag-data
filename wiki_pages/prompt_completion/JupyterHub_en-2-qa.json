    "answer": "Most JupyterHub errors are caused by the underlying job scheduler being unresponsive or unable to find appropriate resources for your session."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when JupyterHub starts a new session in relation to the job scheduler?",
    "answer": "When starting a new session, JupyterHub automatically submits an interactive job on your behalf to the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes a 'Timeout' error if the job does not start?",
    "answer": "If the interactive job submitted by JupyterHub does not start within five minutes, a 'Timeout' error message is raised and the session is cancelled."

  {
    "question": "How can requested resources affect the wait time for a JupyterHub session?",
    "answer": "A longer requested time, or requesting a GPU or too many CPU cores, can cause a longer wait time in the queue for a JupyterHub session."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if they already have another interactive job running on the same cluster when trying to start a JupyterHub session?",
    "answer": "If a user already has another interactive job on the same cluster, their Jupyter session will wait in the queue; it's recommended to stop or cancel any other interactive job if possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if there are no resources available when trying to start a JupyterHub session?",
