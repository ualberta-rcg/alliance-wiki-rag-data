    "question": "What is the solution if TensorFlow reports an error about `libcupti.so` not being found?",
    "answer": "You need to load the appropriate CUDA module (e.g., `module load cuda/9.0.xxx`) and then export the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable using `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CUDA_HOME/extras/CUPTI/lib64/` before executing your script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you find the appropriate CUDA version to resolve the `libcupti.so` error?",
    "answer": "You can find the appropriate CUDA version by using the command `module av cuda`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the `libiomp5.so invalid ELF header` error in TensorFlow?",
    "answer": "This error occurs when the shared object file `libiomp5.so` is incorrectly installed as a text file instead of a proper symbolic link or binary."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you fix the `libiomp5.so invalid ELF header` error?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, navigate to the directory indicated in the error message (e.g., `[...]/_U@mkl_Ulinux_S_S_Cmkl_Ulibs_Ulinux___Uexternal_Smkl_Ulinux_Slib`) and execute the command `ln -sf $(cat libiomp5.so) libiomp5.so`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which configuration parameters control the number of threads used by TensorFlow?",
    "answer": "The `intra_op_parallelism_threads` and `inter_op_parallelism_threads` parameters control the number of threads used by TensorFlow."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the `intra_op_parallelism_threads` and `inter_op_parallelism_threads` parameters set in TensorFlow?",
    "answer": "These parameters can be set using `tf.config.threading.set_inter_op_parallelism_threads(num_threads)` and `tf.config.threading.set_intra_op_parallelism_threads(num_threads)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a known bug in TensorFlow's Keras implementation after version 2.8.3?",
    "answer": "A bug introduced after TensorFlow Keras version 2.8.3 affects the performance of `tf.keras.layers.Random` data augmentation layers (like `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation` and `tf.keras.layers.RandomTranslation`), slowing down the training process by over 100 times."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Keras layers are affected by the performance bug in TensorFlow versions after 2.8.3?",
    "answer": "The performance bug affects data augmentation layers such as `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation` and `tf.keras.layers.RandomTranslation`."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which TensorFlow version was the Keras performance bug related to data augmentation layers fixed?",
    "answer": "The Keras performance bug affecting data augmentation layers was fixed in TensorFlow version 2.12."
