    "question": "What is Torch?",
    "answer": "Torch is a scientific computing framework with extensive support for machine learning algorithms, prioritizing GPUs, and known for its ease of use and efficiency through LuaJIT and an underlying C/CUDA implementation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What scripting language does Torch use?",
    "answer": "Torch uses LuaJIT as its easy and fast scripting language."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the underlying implementation of Torch built upon?",
    "answer": "Torch has an underlying C/CUDA implementation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the relationship between Torch and PyTorch?",
    "answer": "Torch has a distant relationship to PyTorch; PyTorch provides a Python interface to software with similar functionality, but PyTorch is not dependent on Torch."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a prerequisite for using Torch?",
    "answer": "Torch depends on CUDA, so a CUDA module must be loaded first."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load Torch and its dependencies?",
    "answer": "You can load Torch by running the command `module load cuda torch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the name of the Lua package manager that comes with Torch?",
    "answer": "Torch comes with the Lua package manager named `luarocks`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you list the packages installed with luarocks?",
    "answer": "To see a list of installed Lua packages, run `luarocks list`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you install a Lua package locally using luarocks?",
    "answer": "To install a Lua package locally into your own folder, use the command `luarocks install --local --deps-mode=all <package name>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command should be run if locally installed luarocks packages are not found at runtime?",
    "answer": "If locally installed packages are not found at runtime, add the command `eval $(luarocks path --bin)` right before running `lua your_program.lua`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do if a Lua package does not install correctly using luarocks?",
    "answer": "If you have a package that does not install well with `luarocks` or is not installed in the default module, you should contact Technical support for assistance."
