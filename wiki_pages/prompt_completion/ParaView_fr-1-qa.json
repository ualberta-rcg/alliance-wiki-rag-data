  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Remote Render Threshold' option in ParaView preferences?",
    "answer": "It defines a threshold that determines where rendering tasks are performed; small tasks render on the local GPU, while more intensive tasks are directed to the remote server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when the 'Remote Render Threshold' is set to its default value (20Mo)?",
    "answer": "Small rendering tasks will be handled by your computer's GPU, allowing for fast rotation, but any intensive tasks (under 20Mo) will be sent to your computer, potentially slowing down visualization depending on your connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the effect of setting the 'Remote Render Threshold' to 0Mo?",
    "answer": "All rendering will be performed remotely by the cluster's resources, which is good for intensive processing but less ideal for interactive aspects."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a critical requirement for establishing a client-server connection in ParaView regarding software versions?",
    "answer": "The same major version of ParaView must be installed on both the local client and the remote host computer to avoid incompatibilities that could prevent connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "If the ParaView server on a cluster is version 5.13.1, what client version is required on the user's computer?",
    "answer": "You need a client version 5.13.x on your computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What rendering options are available for client-server visualization on Fir, Nibi, Rorqual, and Narval?",
    "answer": "Renders can be performed with a CPU (via software) or a GPU (via hardware)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which rendering method is recommended for client-server visualization on Fir, Nibi, Rorqual, and Narval, and why?",
    "answer": "Using CPUs is recommended because GPU rendering is somewhat complicated, and it's best to allocate as many CPU cores as needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one estimate the number of CPU cores required for visualization on Fir, Nibi, Rorqual, and Narval?",
    "answer": "The easiest way is to divide the estimated necessary memory by approximately 3.5Go/core."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended maximum memory per CPU core for software-based renders on Fir, Nibi, Rorqual, and Narval?",
    "answer": "It is recommended not to exceed 4Go/core, as software renders are very CPU intensive."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch an interactive serial task with a CPU on Fir or Nibi?",
    "answer": "Use the command `salloc --time=1:00:0 --ntasks=1 --mem-per-cpu=3600 --account=def-someprof`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command loads the ParaView module (version 5.13.1) in an interactive task?",
    "answer": "The command is `module load paraview/5.13.1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "After loading the ParaView module, how do you start the ParaView server with off-screen rendering?",
    "answer": "Use the command `pvserver --force-offscreen-rendering`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information should be noted when the ParaView server starts and is waiting for a client connection?",
    "answer": "You should note the node (e.g., fc30107) and the port (usually 11111) from the displayed 'Connection URL'."
