  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of this documentation page?",
    "answer": "This page provides guidance on submitting jobs to clusters for users already familiar with job scheduling and job scripts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should new users unfamiliar with large shared computer clusters read first?",
    "answer": "New users should read 'What is a scheduler?' first."
  },
  {
    "question": "How must all jobs be submitted?",
    "answer": "All jobs must be submitted via the scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tasks are exempt from being submitted via the scheduler?",
    "answer": "Exceptions are made for compilation and other tasks not expected to consume more than about 10 CPU-minutes and about 4 gigabytes of RAM."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can tasks exempt from scheduler submission be run?",
    "answer": "Such tasks may be run on a login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it permissible to run processes on compute nodes without using the scheduler?",
    "answer": "No, processes should not be run on compute nodes except via the scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "What job scheduler is used on the clusters?",
    "answer": "The job scheduler is the Slurm Workload Manager."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can comprehensive documentation for Slurm be found?",
    "answer": "Comprehensive documentation for Slurm is maintained by SchedMD."
  },
  {
    "question": "What resource is available for users transitioning to Slurm from other schedulers like PBS/Torque?",
    "answer": "A table of corresponding commands (a 'Rosetta stone') is available for users coming from PBS/Torque, SGE, LSF, or LoadLeveler."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to submit a job?",
    "answer": "The command to submit a job is `sbatch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What elements are typically included in a minimal Slurm job script?",
    "answer": "A minimal Slurm job script includes a shebang (`#!/bin/bash`), `#SBATCH` directives (e.g., `--time`, `--account`), and executable commands."
  },
  {
    "question": "What resources does a minimal job script reserve on general-purpose (GP) clusters?",
    "answer": "On general-purpose (GP) clusters, a minimal job script reserves 1 core and 256MB of memory for 15 minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does resource reservation differ on Trillium for a minimal job script?",
    "answer": "On Trillium, a minimal job script reserves the whole node with all its memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are directives or options identified within a job script?",
    "answer": "Directives are prefixed with `#SBATCH`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where must `#SBATCH` directives be placed in a job script?",
    "answer": "They must precede all executable commands."
  },
  {
    "question": "What directive is required by policy for each job?",
    "answer": "Users are required to supply at least a time limit (`--time`) for each job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What other directive might be necessary for job submission?",
    "answer": "Users may also need to supply an account name (`--account`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How else can directives be specified for `sbatch` besides within the job script?",
    "answer": "Directives can also be specified as command-line arguments to `sbatch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some acceptable time formats for the `--time` directive?",
    "answer": "Acceptable time formats include \"minutes\", \"minutes:seconds\", \"hours:minutes:seconds\", \"days-hours\", \"days-hours:minutes\", and \"days-hours:minutes:seconds\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the specified time limit impact a job's start time?",
    "answer": "The time limit strongly affects how quickly the job is started, as longer jobs are eligible to run on fewer nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What potential issue can arise from submitting many Slurm jobs rapidly?",
    "answer": "Submitting thousands of jobs at a time can cause Slurm to become unresponsive to other users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What alternatives are recommended for submitting a large number of jobs efficiently?",
    "answer": "Consider using an array job instead, or use `sleep` to space out calls to `sbatch` by one second or more."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two directives for requesting memory?",
    "answer": "Memory may be requested with `--mem-per-cpu` (memory per core) or `--mem` (memory per node)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default memory allocation per core on general-purpose (GP) clusters?",
    "answer": "On general-purpose (GP) clusters, a default memory amount of 256 MB per core will be allocated unless specified otherwise."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is a memory specification required when submitting jobs on Trillium?",
    "answer": "No, on Trillium, a memory specification is not required because only whole nodes are allocated along with all available memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is some memory on a node not available to user jobs?",
    "answer": "Some memory on a node is reserved for the OS and other system functions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a job requests more memory than a node type provides?",
    "answer": "If a job requests more memory than a node type provides, it will be constrained to run on higher-memory nodes, which may be fewer in number."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Slurm interpret memory units like K, M, and G?",
    "answer": "Slurm interprets K, M, G, etc., as binary prefixes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find the maximum memory they can request on each GP cluster node?",
    "answer": "Users can find the maximum memory by checking the 'Available memory' column in the 'Node characteristics' table for each GP cluster."
