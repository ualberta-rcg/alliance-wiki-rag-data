    "question": "What is the primary function of a volume snapshot in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "A volume snapshot saves the state of a volume at the time it was created."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are OpenStack volume snapshots recommended for comprehensive backups?",
    "answer": "No, volume snapshots are not ideal for backups because they depend on the original volume remaining intact."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can OpenStack volume snapshots be downloaded?",
    "answer": "No, it is not possible to download OpenStack volume snapshots as they depend on the original volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is one capability offered by an OpenStack volume snapshot?",
    "answer": "You can create a new volume from a snapshot of a volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what reasons might one create a new volume from a volume snapshot?",
    "answer": "This can be done to revert file changes made since the last snapshot, or to manage file changes specific to a VM that shouldn't be included in other VMs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does OpenStack distinguish between different types of snapshots?",
    "answer": "OpenStack uses the word 'snapshot' to refer to two different things: volume snapshots and snapshots of VMs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when a snapshot of a persistent VM is created in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "OpenStack creates a nearly empty image, which contains pointers to volume snapshots of the persistent VM's boot volume and any attached volumes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you use a snapshot taken from a persistent VM?",
    "answer": "You can create a new VM by booting from the image, which will create new volumes from the snapshots of the volumes taken previously."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary objective when backing up Compute VMs?",
    "answer": "The main goal is to create an image of at least the root drive, and possibly other attached volumes if needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Compute VMs typically boot, contrasting with persistent VMs?",
    "answer": "Compute VMs are meant to be booted from disk images that reside locally on the computer running your VM, not from volumes accessed over the network like persistent VMs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create an image of a Compute VM's root disk?",
    "answer": "You can create an image of a Compute VM's root disk by clicking 'Create Snapshot' on your VM's drop-down menu on the 'Instances' tab."
  },
  {
    "question": "What content is included in a snapshot image created from a Compute VM?",
    "answer": "The snapshot of a Compute VM creates an image that contains a copy of the VM's root drive."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is data stored on the `/mnt` drive of a Compute VM included in its snapshot?",
    "answer": "No, the data on the extra data drive mounted at `/mnt` in a Compute VM is not captured in the image created of the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should data on a Compute VM's `/mnt` drive be saved?",
    "answer": "Other arrangements, such as copying it off the disk before the VM is terminated, must be made to save this data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a challenge associated with managing very large disk images (over 10-20 GB)?",
    "answer": "Very large disk images can be difficult to manage due to relatively long upload times and long VM creation times."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended basic strategy for backing up large disk images?",
    "answer": "A good basic strategy is to separate large data sets from your operating system and software stack."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the operating system and software stack be backed up in an example strategy?",
    "answer": "They can be backed up either using a disk image or recreated using provisioning software."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should large data sets be backed up according to the example strategy?",
    "answer": "The data sets can be backed up with normal file backup methods to a remote location."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific action should be taken for database software like MySQL or PostgreSQL when creating backups?",
    "answer": "You will want to create dumps of the databases to include in your backups."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is identified as the most crucial step in any backup strategy?",
    "answer": "The most important step in a backup strategy is to test restoring from your backup."
