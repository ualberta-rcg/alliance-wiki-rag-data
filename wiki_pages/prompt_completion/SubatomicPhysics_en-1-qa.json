  },
  {
    "question": "When was the Subatomic and High Energy Physics Software page last updated?",
    "answer": "The page was last updated in July 2021."
  },
  {
    "question": "What resources are subatomic experimental physics groups relying on?",
    "answer": "Many subatomic experimental physics groups rely on CVMFS repositories from CERN or the Open Science Grid, and specific repositories for each experiment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What issues can the Compute Canada environment (CCenv) create for subatomic physics setups?",
    "answer": "The CCenv can create conflicts with some setups from CVMFS repositories because standard libraries are provided from the Compute Canada soft.computecanada.ca CVMFS repository using Nix and Easybuild, rather than being installed on the base OS."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended for ATLAS users regarding Tier-3 setups?",
    "answer": "ATLAS users should use the recommended setups for Tier-3 use rather than reinventing techniques."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can ATLAS users find helpful information on Compute Canada Tier-3s and Containers?",
    "answer": "Helpful pages are housed on the TRIUMF twiki, specifically at https://twiki.atlas-canada.ca/bin/view/AtlasCanada/ComputeCanadaTier3s and https://twiki.atlas-canada.ca/bin/view/AtlasCanada/Containers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are HEP_OSLibs packages/rpms installed on Compute Canada computing nodes by default?",
    "answer": "No, many setups assume the base nodes have HEP_OSLibs packages/rpms, but this is not true on Compute Canada computing nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the suggested approach for software setups when HEP_OSLibs are not present on Compute Canada nodes?",
    "answer": "The suggested approach is to use singularity containers which have the necessary RPMs installed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one set up a CentOS7 based view from sft.cern.ch with gcc8?",
    "answer": "Run `source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/setupViews.sh LCG_95 x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does setting up a view from sft.cern.ch using `setupViews.sh` include?",
    "answer": "This setup will include the necessary paths to compilers, geant4, ROOT, and other related software."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can a list of RPMs installed via HEP_OSLibs for CentOS7 be found?",
    "answer": "A list is available at https://gitlab.cern.ch/linuxsupport/rpms/HEP_OSlibs/blob/7.2.11-3.el7/dependencies/HEP_OSlibs.x86_64.dependencies-recursive-flat.txt."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main CVMFS repositories for HEP-related container images?",
    "answer": "The two main repositories are from ATLAS and WLCG."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are the ATLAS distributions of Singularity images documented?",
    "answer": "They are documented at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasComputing/ADCContainersDeployment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the storage locations for ATLAS Singularity images?",
    "answer": "Single file packed images are at `/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/containers/images/singularity/` and unpacked images are at `/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/containers/fs/singularity/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tool does the WLCG unpacked repository use to automate publishing container images to CVMFS?",
    "answer": "It uses DUCC to automate publishing container images from a Docker image registry to CVMFS."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are WLCG container images published to CVMFS for use with Singularity and Docker?",
    "answer": "Images are published in a standard directory structure for Singularity, and a layered format that Docker can use directly via its graph driver plugin."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can additional documentation for the DUCC project be found?",
    "answer": "Additional documentation for DUCC is available at https://github.com/cvmfs/ducc."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are the WLCG unpacked container images located in CVMFS?",
    "answer": "The images are located under `/cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the Singularity executable provided on Compute Canada sites?",
    "answer": "It is provided in slight variants and installed outside the usual Compute Canada CVMFS stack, as it runs in a setuid environment by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some likely candidate versions of Singularity on Compute Canada sites?",
    "answer": "2.6.1, 3.2.0, and 3.3.0 are the most likely candidate versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is Singularity typically located on Cedar and Graham Compute Canada sites?",
    "answer": "On Cedar and Graham, Singularity is typically located under `/opt/software/singularity-x.x.x`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is Singularity invoked on the Niagara Compute Canada site?",
    "answer": "On Niagara, Singularity is invoked by running `module load singularity; /opt/singularity/2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main ways to invoke a container from a CVMFS repository?",
    "answer": "A container can be invoked directly (as the image will be cached) or by pulling and storing the image in your local area."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a potential benefit of pulling a container image from CVMFS and storing it locally?",
    "answer": "Pulling and storing the image in your local area may provide some performance benefits, depending on the system."
