    "question": "How do I submit an Ansys Workbench project to the queue?",
    "answer": "You can submit an Ansys Workbench project to the queue by customizing one of the provided Slurm scripts (e.g., `script-wbpj-202X.sh`) and then running the `sbatch script-wbpj-202X.sh` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical Slurm script requirements for an Ansys Workbench job using StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "For an Ansys Workbench job using StdEnv/2023, the Slurm script typically requires specifying the account (`#SBATCH --account`), time limit (`#SBATCH --time`), total memory (`#SBATCH --mem`), number of cores (`#SBATCH --ntasks`), and must be run on a single node (`#SBATCH --nodes=1`). The script also loads `StdEnv/2023 ansys/2023R2` (or newer versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Ansys Workbench Slurm scripts configure shared memory (SMP) or distributed memory (DMP) parallelism?",
    "answer": "Ansys Workbench Slurm scripts determine the memory parallelism (`MEMPAR`) based on the number of nodes. If `SLURM_NNODES` is 1, `MEMPAR` is set to 0 for Shared Memory Parallel (SMP); otherwise, it's set to 1 for Distributed Memory Parallel (DMP). This value is then written into the `SolveHandlers.xml` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to run Ansys Workbench in a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The command `runwb2 -B -E \"Update()\" -F YOURPROJECT.wbpj` is used to run Ansys Workbench in batch mode to update a project. An alternative, commented-out line, `runwb2 -B -E \"Update();Save(Overwrite=True)\" -F YOURPROJECT.wbpj`, shows how to also save the solution."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I prevent a running Ansys Workbench job from overwriting the solution when it completes successfully?",
    "answer": "To avoid overwriting the solution, you should remove `;Save(Overwrite=True)` from within the last line of your Workbench Slurm script, leaving only `runwb2 -B -E \"Update()\" -F YOURPROJECT.wbpj`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are needed to prepare an Ansys Workbench project file before its first submission to a cluster queue?",
    "answer": "Before submitting a project file for the first time, you need to connect to the cluster with TigerVNC, navigate to the project directory, start Workbench with the same Ansys module used for creation, open the project, right-click 'Setup' and select 'Clear All Generated Data', then exit Workbench without saving the modified project when prompted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I generate an input file for Ansys Mechanical APDL jobs?",
    "answer": "You can generate an input file for Ansys Mechanical APDL jobs from within your interactive Workbench Mechanical session by clicking 'Solution -> Tools -> Write Input Files', then specifying `File name:` as `YOURAPDLFILE.inp` and `Save as type:` as `APDL Input Files (*.inp)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are Ansys Mechanical APDL jobs submitted to the queue?",
    "answer": "APDL jobs are submitted to the queue by running the `sbatch script-name.sh` command after creating a suitable Slurm script."
