    "question": "What is the purpose of the provided batch job script `a100_4g.20gb_mig_job.sh`?",
    "answer": "The script `a100_4g.20gb_mig_job.sh` provides an example for requesting an A100 4g.20gb GPU instance for a 24-hour batch job, configured with specific CPU cores and system memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which GPU instance is requested in the `a100_4g.20gb_mig_job.sh` example script?",
    "answer": "The script requests one instance of `a100_4g.20gb`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPU cores per task are specified in the `a100_4g.20gb_mig_job.sh` example for a Narval GPU instance?",
    "answer": "The script specifies 6 CPU cores per task, which is the maximum recommended for 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb instances on Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "What amount of system memory is allocated for the job in the `a100_4g.20gb_mig_job.sh` example?",
    "answer": "The example script allocates 62GB of system memory, which is the maximum recommended for 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb instances on Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the requested time limit for the batch job defined in the `a100_4g.20gb_mig_job.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The job requests a time limit of 24 hours (24:00:00)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find information on current and past jobs to determine if they should use a GPU instance?",
    "answer": "Users can find information on current and past jobs on the Narval usage portal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key metrics to consider when evaluating if a job should use a GPU instance instead of a full GPU?",
    "answer": "The key metrics to consider are power consumption, GPU functionality utilization, maximum GPU memory usage, and the average number of CPU cores required by the job."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is power consumption a good indicator for determining if a job is suitable for a GPU instance?",
    "answer": "Power consumption is a good indicator of the total computing power requested from the GPU. If a job uses significantly less power than a full GPU's maximum TDP, it might be suitable for an instance."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is GPU functionality utilization particularly useful for assessing a job's resource usage?",
    "answer": "GPU functionality utilization provides insights into the usage of the GPU in cases where power consumption alone might not be sufficient to determine job suitability for an instance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users monitor a running job in real-time to assess its resource usage?",
    "answer": "Users can monitor a running job by attaching to the node where it is currently running and then using `nvidia-smi` to read GPU metrics in real-time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations of using `nvidia-smi` for monitoring a running job's overall usage?",
    "answer": "`nvidia-smi` will not provide maximum and average values for memory and power usage for the entire job, but it can help identify and troubleshoot underperforming jobs in real-time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to use multiple Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) instances on the same physical GPU?",
    "answer": "No, using multiple MIG instances on the same physical GPU is not supported."
  },
  {
    "question": "If running multiple independent tasks on a single GPU is desired, and MIG instances are not supported for this, what is the recommended alternative?",
    "answer": "For running multiple independent tasks on a GPU, users should use MPS (Multi-Process Service) instead of MIG."
