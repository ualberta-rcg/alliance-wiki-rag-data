  {
    "question": "Are there dedicated resources for handling personal, private, or sensitive data like human clinical research data?",
    "answer": "No, there are no resources specifically designated for sensitive data at this time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the resources formally certified for specific security or privacy assurance levels?",
    "answer": "No resource is formally certified as meeting specific security or privacy assurance levels which may be required for certain datasets."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are shared resources, networks, nodes, and memory provided?",
    "answer": "Yes, we provide shared resources, shared networks, shared nodes, and shared memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is data guaranteed to be encrypted at rest?",
    "answer": "No, data is not guaranteed to be encrypted at rest."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of access control is offered for files and directories?",
    "answer": "We offer the standard Linux filesystem segregation and access control to files and directories."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do sysadmins have access to user material?",
    "answer": "Yes, our sysadmins do have access to all this material when necessary or when authorized by their owners."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is ultimately responsible for data protection and privacy?",
    "answer": "Responsibility for data protection and data privacy rests ultimately with the researcher."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can researchers find policy information?",
    "answer": "Researchers can find policy information at [https://alliancecan.ca/en/policies our policies]."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can support staff provide guidance on sensitive data handling?",
    "answer": "Yes, support staff can give guidance on handling of sensitive data, including advice on access control, encryption, storage, and transmission."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted for assistance with sensitive data?",
    "answer": "Please contact technical support for assistance with sensitive data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is data protected against hardware failure?",
    "answer": "Our basic principle is to have some level of duplication for most filesystems, with the level of duplication depending on the risk of a potential hardware failure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does local storage on compute nodes have data duplication?",
    "answer": "Local storage on compute nodes, where it exists, does not have any form of duplication."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are scratch filesystems protected against hardware failure?",
    "answer": "Scratch filesystems have high reliability to protect against multiple simultaneous disk failures, but they do not have a backup."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are project and home filesystems protected against hardware failure?",
    "answer": "Project and home filesystems have high reliability to protect against multiple simultaneous disk failures, and also have periodic backup copies."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Nearline storage protect data?",
    "answer": "Nearline storage provides copies of data on tape."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two primary ways unauthorized access to data could occur?",
    "answer": "Unauthorized access to data could happen through hardware and software."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is data protected against unauthorized hardware access?",
    "answer": "Only approved personnel can physically access the infrastructure, and removed storage devices are either destroyed or encrypted/erased before being returned to the vendor."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is data protected against unauthorized software access?",
    "answer": "All clusters use standard POSIX and ACL permissions on their filesystems to protect against unauthorized software access."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default permissions for new files?",
    "answer": "Default permissions are such that new files created are writable by the owner and readable by the group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is responsible for ensuring correct file permissions?",
    "answer": "Ultimately, the owner of a file is responsible for ensuring that it belongs to the desired group and has the appropriate permissions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the systems protected against privilege escalation or hacks?",
    "answer": "The team monitors CVE mailing lists and applies patches, systems are monitored for anomalous behavior indicating intrusions, and privileged employee accounts have stricter security requirements."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is unauthorized access completely impossible on shared infrastructure?",
    "answer": "No, while precautions are taken to minimize risk, the clusters remain shared infrastructure, and the possibility of unauthorized access does exist."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tool is recommended for additional data encryption?",
    "answer": "If data requires an additional level of protection, researchers should consider encrypting it using GNU Privacy Guard (gpg), which is installed on the clusters."
