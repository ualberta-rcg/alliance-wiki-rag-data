  {
    "question": "What is gprof?",
    "answer": "gprof is a profiling software that collects information and compiles statistics on your code. It searches for functions and subroutines in your program and inserts timing instructions for each one."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does gprof come from and how is it available on clusters?",
    "answer": "gprof comes with the GNU compiler suite and is available with the `gcc` module on our clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the GNU compiler for use with gprof?",
    "answer": "You load the appropriate GNU compiler, for example, by using the command `module load gcc/7.3.0` for GCC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to compile your code for useful gprof information?",
    "answer": "To get useful information from gprof, you need to compile your code with debugging information enabled by adding the `-pg` option to the compilation command with GNU compilers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `-pg` option do during compilation for gprof?",
    "answer": "The `-pg` option tells the compiler to generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What error might occur if code is compiled without the `-pg` option for gprof?",
    "answer": "Without the `-pg` option, no call-graph data will be gathered, and you may get the error: `gprof: gmon.out file is missing call-graph data`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you execute your code after it's been compiled for gprof?",
    "answer": "You execute it the same way as you would without gprof profiling, using its path and any arguments, e.g., `/path/to/your/executable arg1 arg2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file is created after executing a gprof-compiled binary?",
    "answer": "After the binary has been executed and finished without errors, a new file named `gmon.out` is created in the current working directory (or the new working directory if the code changes it)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you generate the profiling data report using gprof?",
    "answer": "You execute the gprof tool with the binary name and the `gmon.out` file as arguments, typically redirecting the output to an analysis file, like `gprof /path/to/your/executable gmon.out > analysis.txt`."
