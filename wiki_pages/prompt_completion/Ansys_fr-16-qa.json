    "question": "What should I do if the Ansys graphical interface (GUI) freezes or does not start correctly?",
    "answer": "If the Ansys graphical interface (Workbench or other programs) freezes or fails to start, especially after a vnsviewer disconnection, open a new terminal on gra-vdi and run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|fluent|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE|mono\"` to stop all Ansys processes. If the issue persists and you previously used the GUI on compute nodes, try `rm -rf .ansys`. If the problem relates to storage (/home, /project, or /scratch), Ansys should function normally once the storage issue is resolved."
  },
  {
    "question": "What could cause Ansys GUI processes to persist and block licenses or cause errors?",
    "answer": "Persistent processes can block licenses or cause other unusual errors if an Ansys GUI session (Fluent, Workbench, etc.) is not properly terminated before the vncviewer is manually or unexpectedly closed (e.g., due to a temporary network outage or a blocked file system). In the latter case, processes might not be killed until normal disk access is restored."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I launch Ensight from gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To launch Ensight from gra-vdi, load the `SnEnv` module, followed by `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions back to 2021R2), and then execute `ensight`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules should be loaded to use Rocky on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To use Rocky on gra-vdi, you can load `clumod ansysrocky/2023R2 CcEnv StdEnv/2020 ansys/2023R2`, `clumod ansysrocky/2024R2.0 CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys/2024R2.04`, or `CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys/2025R1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the different commands to launch Rocky programs on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "You can launch Rocky programs using `Rocky` (which reads `~/licenses/ansys.lic`), `Rocky-gui` (which allows selection of CMC or SHARCNET servers via local ansysrocky modules), `RockySolver` (to run the solver directly from the command line), or `RockySchedular` (to launch the graphical interface for submitting and running tasks on the current node, though this is untested)."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which clusters is Rocky 2024R2 and older available?",
    "answer": "Rocky for 2024R2 and older versions is currently only available on gra-vdi and Graham clusters; installation on other clusters is planned for June."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Rocky 2025R1 supported by the SHARCNET license server?",
    "answer": "Rocky for 2025R1 and newer versions is provided on all clusters by the Ansys module, but it is not yet supported by the SHARCNET license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Rocky use GPUs on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "No, Rocky can only use CPUs on gra-vdi as there is currently only one GPU dedicated to graphics."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the SHARCNET license free for Rocky usage?",
    "answer": "Yes, the SHARCNET license now includes Rocky, and its use is free for academic research."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is running Ansys GUI programs via SSH X-redirection recommended?",
    "answer": "No, running Ansys GUI programs via SSH X-redirection to your local computer is neither tested nor supported. It relies on a correctly configured X display server or a suitable X client emulator, and users often find the interactive response times unacceptable, although it might be useful for basic menu operations or running calculations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is SSH X-redirection generally slow for Ansys GUI programs?",
    "answer": "SSH X-redirection can be very slow for Ansys GUI programs, with startup times potentially taking up to 40 minutes in tests, compared to 34 seconds with vncviewer. This is due to network dependency and the overhead of rendering graphics over SSH."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the basic steps to attempt running an Ansys GUI program via SSH X-redirection?",
    "answer": "The basic steps are: 1) `ssh -Y username@graham.computecanada.ca`; 2) `salloc --x11 --time=1:00:00 --mem=16G --cpus-per-task=4 [--gpus-per-node=1] --account=def-mygroup`; 3) Once connected to a compute node, test by running `xclock`. If the clock appears, load the desired Ansys module and try to run the program."
