    "question": "How do you start AnsysEDT in graphical mode on VDI nodes after loading the required modules?",
    "answer": "After loading the necessary modules (e.g., `module load SnEnv` and `module load ansysedt/2023R2`), type `ansysedt` in the terminal and wait for the GUI to start."
  },
  {
    "question": "What one-time configuration is necessary in AnsysEDT's GUI to allow the use of more than 4 cores for HPC analysis?",
    "answer": "You need to navigate to `Tools -> Options -> HPC and Analysis Options -> Options`, change the `HPC License` pulldown menu to `Pool`, and then click `OK`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to copy the 2023R2 Antennas examples directory into a user's account?",
    "answer": "First, load the `ansysedt/2023R2` module. Then, execute the following commands: `mkdir -p ~/Ansoft/$EBVERSIONANSYSEDT; cd ~/Ansoft/$EBVERSIONANSYSEDT; rm -rf Antennas` followed by `cp -a $EBROOTANSYSEDT/v232/Linux64/Examples/HFSS/Antennas ~/Ansoft/$EBVERSIONANSYSEDT`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run an example simulation using AnsysEDT's graphical interface?",
    "answer": "Open a simulation `.aedt` file, then click `HFSS -> Validation Check`. After checking for errors, click `Project -> Analyze All` to run the simulation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you quit an AnsysEDT simulation without saving the converged solution?",
    "answer": "To quit without saving the converged solution, click `File -> Close -> No`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps should be taken if AnsysEDT crashes and fails to restart?",
    "answer": "If the program crashes and won't restart, try running `pkill -9 -u $USER -f \"ansys*|mono|mwrpcss|apip-standalone-service\"` and then `rm -rf ~/.mw`. The latter command will cause AnsysEDT to re-run its first-time configuration upon the next startup."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the SHARCNET Ansys license configured for AnsysEDT modules on any Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET Ansys license can be configured by creating or modifying the file `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` with the following lines: `setenv(\"ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE\", \"1055@license3.sharcnet.ca\")` and `setenv(\"ANSYSLI_SERVERS\", \"2325@license3.sharcnet.ca\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the initial steps to load a local AnsysEDT module and run it graphically on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "First, connect to gra-vdi.computecanada.ca with TigerVNC. Open a new terminal window, then load the modules using `module load SnEnv` and `module load ansysedt/2024R2.1` (or an older version). Finally, type `ansysedt` to start the program."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a user choose between the SHARCNET and CMC license servers when starting AnsysEDT on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "After typing `ansysedt` and accepting the conditions with 'y' and 'Enter', press 'Enter' again to accept the default 'n' option for the SHARCNET license server. To use the CMC license server, change 'n' to 'y' and then hit 'Enter'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are suitable activities for using AnsysEDT on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Suitable usage includes running a single test job interactively with up to 8 cores and/or 128G RAM, creating or modifying simulation input files, post-processing data, or visualizing simulation results."
