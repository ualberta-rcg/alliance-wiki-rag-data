    "question": "How can one determine if a requested GPU is not being used at all by a task?",
    "answer": "If the GPU remains entirely unused, as depicted in the GPU cycle calculation graph, with no recorded activity, it suggests that the GPU is not contributing to the task and resources are being wasted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What considerations should be made when a task requests a GPU but shows no GPU utilization?",
    "answer": "It is important to question the necessity of using a GPU for the task. Even if execution time is longer on a CPU, the high cost of GPU usage might not be justified. Also, faster execution on a GPU node could be due to more powerful CPUs rather than GPU acceleration."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you identify if a job requests multiple GPUs but only uses one?",
    "answer": "If a user requests multiple GPUs (e.g., two), but the calculation cycle, power, and memory graphs show activity for only one GPU (e.g., GPU 0), while other requested GPUs (e.g., GPU 1) show no recorded metrics like SM Active or SM Occupancy, it indicates that only one GPU is being utilized."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the corrective actions when multiple GPUs are requested but only one is actually used?",
    "answer": "To correct this situation, you can either modify your code to effectively use all the requested GPUs or, if only one is truly needed, simply request a single GPU in your submission script (e.g., change `--gpu-per-node=2` to `--gpu-per-node=1`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one detect if a full 4-GPU node was reserved but only one GPU was utilized?",
    "answer": "You can detect this if the GPU calculation cycle graph indicates that GPUs 1, 2, and 3 are unused (no data for SM Active, SM Occupancy), and similarly, only GPU 0 shows activity in the GPU power and memory graphs, confirming the other GPUs remained inactive."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended solution if a task reserves a 4-GPU node but only leverages one GPU?",
    "answer": "To resolve this, you should either adapt your code to fully exploit all four GPUs or, if only one is sufficient, adjust your job submission script to request only one GPU (e.g., change `--gpu-per-node=4` to `--gpu-per-node=1`)."
