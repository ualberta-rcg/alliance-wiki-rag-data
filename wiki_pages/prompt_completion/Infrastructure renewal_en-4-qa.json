    "question": "Will the standard software environment from the current systems be available on the new systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, our standard software environment will be available on the new systems."

  {
    "question": "Will commercial and licensed software be transferred to the new systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, the plan is to transition current commercial software licenses from old systems to their new replacements, ensuring users have identical access to special applications like Gaussian and AMS/ADF. However, there's a small risk that software providers might change licensing terms for the new system, which will be addressed individually."

  {
    "question": "Will there be overlapping outages during the transition?",
    "answer": "While efforts will be made to limit overlapping outages, constraints due to delivery schedules and funding deadlines mean there will probably be periods when several systems are simultaneously offline. Outages will be announced as early as possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to purchase old hardware after the equipment upgrades?",
    "answer": "Most of the equipment is legally owned by the hosting institution, which manages its disposal following their guidelines, typically involving 'e-cycling' (recycling) rather than selling. If you wish to acquire old hardware, it's best to contact the host institution directly to inquire about their specific policies or options."
