    "question": "What is the purpose of the bgcdist software?",
    "answer": "bgcdist implements Bayesian estimation of genomic clines to quantify introgression at many loci. It offers models for linked loci, genotype uncertainty, and sequence errors, which can be used to estimate genomic cline parameters from next-generation sequence data."
