  {
    "question": "Who is responsible for data migration to the new systems?",
    "answer": "Data migration to the new systems is the responsibility of each National Host Site, who will inform users of the necessary actions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will files be deleted when a system undergoes a complete data center shutdown as part of renewal activities?",
    "answer": "No, files will not be deleted. During renewal activities, each National Host Site will migrate /project and /home data from the existing storage system to the new storage system. Backups and /nearline data on tape systems will also remain unchanged."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users find out about upcoming outages?",
    "answer": "Each National Host Site will have its own schedule for outages, which will be described on the system status web page ([https://status.alliancecan.ca](https://status.alliancecan.ca)). General updates will be provided on the wiki page, and users will periodically receive emails with updates and outage notices."

  {
    "question": "Whom should I contact if I have questions about the transition to the new infrastructure?",
    "answer": "You should contact technical support for any questions regarding the transition."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will my existing jobs and applications be compatible with the new systems?",
    "answer": "Generally, yes, but the new CPUs and GPUs may require recompilation or reconfiguration of some applications. More details will be provided as the transition unfolds."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will the standard software environment from the current systems be available on the new systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, the standard software environment will be available on the new systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will commercial, licensed software be moved to the new systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, the plan is to transition current commercial software licenses from old systems to their new replacements, aiming for identical access to special applications (e.g., Gaussian, AMS/ADF). However, there is a small risk that software providers may change their licensing terms."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible for multiple systems to be offline at the same time during the upgrade process?",
    "answer": "Yes, due to constraints on delivery schedules and funding deadlines, there will probably be periods when several systems are simultaneously offline, though efforts will be made to limit overlapping outages. Outages will be announced as early as possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I purchase old hardware after equipment upgrades?",
    "answer": "Most of the equipment is legally the property of the hosting institution, which typically manages its disposal through \"e-cycling\" rather than selling. If you are looking to acquire old hardware, it's best to contact the host institution directly to inquire about their specific policies or options."
