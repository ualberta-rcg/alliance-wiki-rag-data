    "question": "What kind of issue is the provided Fortran code snippet designed to prevent?",
    "answer": "The Fortran code snippet is designed to prevent segmentation errors that can occur when passing function pointers as arguments between routines."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one avoid segmentation faults when passing a function as an argument in Fortran?",
    "answer": "To avoid segmentation faults when passing a function as an argument, you must explicitly define its interface using the `INTERFACE` command in Fortran. This involves defining the interface of the function being passed within the calling program/routine, and also defining the interface of the function pointer argument within the function that receives it."

  {
    "question": "In the `interface_pointer.f90` example, where is the `INTERFACE` block for `FunctionToIntegrate` located?",
    "answer": "In the `interface_pointer.f90` example, the `INTERFACE` block for `FunctionToIntegrate` is located within the `Program Eigenvalue`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the interface for the function pointer argument `func` defined within `computeIntegral` in the `interface_pointer.f90` example?",
    "answer": "Within the `computeIntegral` function in `interface_pointer.f90`, an `INTERFACE` block is used to explicitly define the signature of the `func` argument, including its return type and arguments."
