  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `APPTAINER_BIND` environment variable when using the `qiime` command?",
    "answer": "Since the `qiime` command calls a container, you may need to define the `APPTAINER_BIND` environment variable to bind specific folders within the container to access your data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended installation methods for QIIME2?",
    "answer": "QIIME2 can be installed using Apptainer or EasyBuild, with Apptainer being strongly preferred."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is Apptainer the preferred installation method for QIIME2?",
    "answer": "Apptainer is strongly preferred because it does not generate many thousands of files in your /home directory, which could potentially cause you to exceed disk quota limits."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do QIIME2 developers publish their Apptainer images?",
    "answer": "The QIIME2 developers publish images on Quay.io."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the initial step to use a QIIME2 image from Quay.io with Apptainer?",
    "answer": "You must first build an Apptainer image, for example, by running `module load apptainer` and then `apptainer build qiime2-2021.11.sif docker://quay.io/qiime2/core:2021.11`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does it take to build an Apptainer image for QIIME2, and how often must it be done?",
    "answer": "This build step may take over an hour, but you only need to do this once. Save the image file for later re-use."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you execute QIIME commands within an Apptainer image?",
    "answer": "You typically run each QIIME command in an `apptainer exec` statement, like `apptainer exec qiime2-2021.11.sif <your QIIME command>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the bind option (`-B`) important when running QIIME2 commands with Apptainer?",
    "answer": "It is important to use the bind option (`-B`) with each folder you want to work with when you run programs in your container to ensure proper data access."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a 'Timezone offset does not match system offset' error be resolved when importing data into QIIME format via Apptainer?",
    "answer": "This can be worked around by setting the time zone before invoking Apptainer, using `export TZ='UTC'` followed by the `apptainer exec` command."
