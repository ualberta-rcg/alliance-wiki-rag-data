    "question": "What is the function of the `-sourcePrefix` option in `gtfToGenePred`?",
    "answer": "The `-sourcePrefix=pre` option processes entries where the source name has the specified prefix, and it can be repeated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `-impliedStopAfterCds` option signify in `gtfToGenePred`?",
    "answer": "It indicates an implied stop codon after the CDS (Coding Sequence)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if you use the `-simple` option with `gtfToGenePred`?",
    "answer": "The `-simple` option will only check column validity, not hierarchy, which may result in a damaged genePred."

  {
    "question": "How can you use `gene_name` for the `name2` field instead of `gene_id` in `gtfToGenePred`?",
    "answer": "You can use the `-geneNameAsName2` option to use `gene_name` for the `name2` field instead of `gene_id`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can `gene_version` or `transcript_version` attributes be included in identifiers when converting GTF to genePred?",
    "answer": "Use the `-includeVersion` option, which will include `gene_version` and/or `transcript_version` in the corresponding identifiers if those attributes exist."
