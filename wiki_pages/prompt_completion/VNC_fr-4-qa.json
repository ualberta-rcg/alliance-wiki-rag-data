    "question": "What happens if I exit the node to which my SSH tunnel is connected?",
    "answer": "If you exit the node to which your tunnel is connected, you will no longer be able to connect to the VNC server with vncviewer. However, as vncserver will continue to function, you will still be able to access it with a new tunnel."

  {
    "question": "How do you connect to the VNC server from your local machine once an SSH tunnel is established, specifically on Linux?",
    "answer": "Under Linux, open a new terminal window and connect your VNC client to `localhost:port`."

  {
    "question": "What command is used to connect the TigerVNC viewer to a VNC server accessible via `localhost` on port `5905`?",
