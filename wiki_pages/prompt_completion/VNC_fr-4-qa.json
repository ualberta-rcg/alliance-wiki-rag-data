    "question": "How can users establish multiple connections to the same VNC server?",
    "answer": "Multiple connections can be established if the vncserver was started with the `-AlwaysShared` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a VNC server is not started with the `-AlwaysShared` option and I try to connect from a different location?",
    "answer": "If a vncserver was not started with `-AlwaysShared`, only a single vncviewer connection is possible. Before leaving for home, you would need to close all applications on the desktop and shut down the vncserver. Once at home, you would then need to create a new desktop and reopen the applications to continue your work."
  },
  {
    "question": "What might cause repeated failures to establish a new VNC connection?",
    "answer": "Repeated failures to establish a new vncserver/vncviewer connection could be caused by an existing SSH tunnel on your computer that is blocking ports."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I identify and terminate SSH tunnels that might be blocking VNC connections?",
    "answer": "To determine the presence of such tunnels and terminate them, open a terminal window on your computer and execute the command `ps ux | grep ssh` followed by `kill PID` for the identified process IDs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which password should be used if the VNC screensaver asks for one?",
    "answer": "If your VNC screensaver asks for a password, enter the password for your account on the cluster, not the vncserver password."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used if the MATE desktop screensaver doesn't unlock?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Is the VNC screensaver currently active on the clusters?",
    "answer": "No, the VNC screensaver has been disabled on our clusters, so this issue should no longer occur."

  {
    "question": "What are the two steps for logging in to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca?",
    "answer": "The two steps for logging in to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca are: 1) entering your username and password for CCDB, and 2) entering your username and passcode for multi-factor authentication."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if I enter an incorrect CCDB password during the first step of logging into gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca?",
    "answer": "If you enter an incorrect username/password for the first step of logging into gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca, you will still proceed to the second step. After entering your username/password again, you will receive a message indicating that the connection is established, and you will be returned to the first login screen."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I resolve a login issue to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca where I am returned to the first login screen after entering credentials?",
    "answer": "The solution is to retry the login, ensuring you have entered the correct username/password combination."
