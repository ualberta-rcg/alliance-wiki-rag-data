    "question": "What are 'flavors' in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "In OpenStack, 'flavors' are virtual hardware templates that define sizes for RAM, disk, number of cores, and other parameters for virtual machines, offering users a choice in the type of VM to run."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can researchers view the OpenStack flavors allocated to their project?",
    "answer": "Researchers can view their allocated flavors in the Horizon Dashboard or via the OpenStack command line client using the command `openstack flavor list --sort-column RAM`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should someone do if they need an OpenStack flavor not currently allocated to their project?",
    "answer": "If a project requires a flavor not currently allocated, users should email cloud@tech.alliancecan.ca."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the prefix 'c' designate in OpenStack virtual machine flavor names?",
    "answer": "The prefix 'c' designates 'compute'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the prefix 'p' designate in OpenStack virtual machine flavor names?",
    "answer": "The prefix 'p' designates 'persistent'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the prefix 'g' designate in OpenStack virtual machine flavor names?",
    "answer": "The prefix 'g' designates 'vGPU'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the amount of RAM indicated in an OpenStack flavor name?",
    "answer": "The amount of RAM is indicated after the first dash in the flavor name, following the number of virtual vCPUs/vGPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the size of a secondary ephemeral disk specified in an OpenStack flavor name?",
    "answer": "If a second dash is present in the flavor name, it is followed by the size of the secondary ephemeral disk in gigabytes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of a 'c' flavor virtual machine?",
    "answer": "A 'c' flavor virtual machine is intended for jobs of finite lifetime, as well as for development and testing tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "From what format image does a 'c' flavor VM typically start?",
    "answer": "A 'c' flavor VM starts from a qcow2-format image."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do the disks of a 'c' flavor VM reside, and what is their redundancy level?",
    "answer": "The disks of a 'c' flavor VM reside on the local hardware running the VM and have no redundancy (RAID 0)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical root disk size for a 'c' flavor VM?",
    "answer": "The root disk for a 'c' flavor VM is typically 20GB in size."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do 'c' flavor VMs include a secondary ephemeral data disk, and what happens to it?",
    "answer": "Yes, 'c' flavor VMs include a secondary ephemeral data disk, which is created and destroyed along with the instance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Arbutus cloud manage CPU over-commit for 'c' flavors, and what kind of tasks are they suited for?",
    "answer": "The Arbutus cloud treats 'c' flavors with no over-commit on CPU, targeting them towards CPU intensive tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the intended operational duration for a 'p' flavor virtual machine?",
    "answer": "A 'p' flavor virtual machine is intended to run for an indeterminate length of time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are 'p' flavor instances typically booted?",
    "answer": "The intended use of 'p' flavors is that they should be booted from a volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What storage system backs a 'p' flavor instance booted from a volume?",
    "answer": "A 'p' flavor instance booted from a volume will be backed by the Ceph storage system."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the redundancy of a 'p' flavor instance compare to a 'c' instance?",
    "answer": "A 'p' flavor instance has greater redundancy and resistance to failure than a 'c' instance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended minimum volume size for a persistent VM root disk when using a 'p' flavor?",
    "answer": "A volume size of at least 20GB is recommended for the persistent VM root disk with a 'p' flavor."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Arbutus cloud manage CPU over-commit for 'p' flavors, and what types of instances are they geared towards?",
    "answer": "The Arbutus cloud over-commits the CPU for 'p' flavors, gearing them towards web servers, database servers, and instances with a lower or bursty CPU usage profile."
