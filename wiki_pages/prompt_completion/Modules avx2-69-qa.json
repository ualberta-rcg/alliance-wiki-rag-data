  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main function of MAKER?",
    "answer": "MAKER is a portable and configurable genome annotation pipeline. Its purpose is to allow smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic genome projects to independently annotate their genomes and create genome databases by identifying repeats, aligning ESTs and proteins, producing ab-initio gene predictions, and synthesizing this data into gene annotations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of MAKER is mentioned?",
    "answer": "The mentioned version of MAKER is 3.01.03."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of variants does Manta call?",
    "answer": "Manta calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped paired-end sequencing reads."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what types of analyses is Manta optimized?",
    "answer": "Manta is optimized for the analysis of germline variation in small sets of individuals and somatic variation in tumor/normal sample pairs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the version number for Manta?",
    "answer": "The version number for Manta is 1.6.0."
