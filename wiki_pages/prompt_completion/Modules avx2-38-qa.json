  {
    "question": "What is the main goal of gclust software?",
    "answer": "Gclust software aims to create clusters of protein sequences from predicted protein sequences in a selected set of genomes, forming homolog groups."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does gclust distinguish between homolog and ortholog clusters?",
    "answer": "Gclust forms homolog groups, not ortholog clusters. Ortholog clusters, like those in KEGG Orthologs or COG in NCBI, contain only a single sequence for each genome, typically selected by a bi-directional best hit criterion."
