  {
    "question": "How do you specify an LSTC license server using environment variables in a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "You can specify an LSTC license server by setting two environment variables in your Slurm scripts: `export LSTC_LICENSE=network` and `export LSTC_LICENSE_SERVER=<port>@<server>`, where `<port>` is an integer and `<server>` is the hostname or IP address."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do environment variables for an LSTC license take precedence over the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file?",
    "answer": "Yes, the environment variables `LSTC_LICENSE` and `LSTC_LICENSE_SERVER` will take priority over any values specified in your `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file still required even if using LSTC license environment variables?",
    "answer": "Yes, the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file must exist (even if empty) for any `ls-dyna` or `ls-dyna-mpi` module to successfully load, even when using environment variables."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file exists on a cluster?",
    "answer": "You can ensure the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file exists by running `touch ~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` once on the command line for each cluster where you plan to submit jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure an LS-DYNA license hosted on an Ansys license server?",
    "answer": "To configure an Ansys-hosted LS-DYNA license, set the environment variables `export LSTC_LICENSE=ansys` and `export ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=<port>@<server>` in your Slurm scripts, where `<port>` is an integer and `<server>` is the hostname or IP address of the Ansys license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Ansys license server variables be defined in the `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file?",
    "answer": "No, the `LSTC_LICENSE` and `ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE` variables for an Ansys license server cannot be defined in your `~/.licenses/ls-dyna.lic` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum module version required for LS-DYNA to work with Ansys license servers?",
    "answer": "Only module versions greater than or equal to 12.2.1 will work with Ansys license servers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can SHARCNET users access a free LS-DYNA license?",
    "answer": "Yes, the SHARCNET Ansys license supports running SMP and MPP LS-DYNA jobs for free on a core and job-limited basis for anyone."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which clusters can the SHARCNET Ansys license be used?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET Ansys license can be used on Graham, Narval, or Cedar clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variables are needed to use the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "To use the SHARCNET Ansys license, add `export LSTC_LICENSE=ansys` and `export ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=1055@license3.sharcnet.ca` to your Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure an LS-DYNA license purchased from CMC Microsystems?",
    "answer": "If your LS-DYNA license was purchased from CMC, set `export LSTC_LICENSE=ansys` and `export ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=<port>@<IP_address>` according to the cluster you are using, with the specific IP address for that cluster's CADpass server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the specific IP addresses for CMC licenses on different clusters?",
    "answer": "The CMC license IP addresses are: Beluga: `6624@10.20.73.21`, Cedar: `6624@172.16.121.25`, Graham: `6624@10.25.1.56`, Narval: `6624@10.100.64.10`, Niagara: `6624@172.16.205.199`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are firewall changes necessary to use a CMC LS-DYNA license?",
    "answer": "No, firewall changes are not required to use a CMC license on any cluster as these have already been done."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum module version required for LS-DYNA to work with CMC license servers?",
    "answer": "Only module versions greater than or equal to 13.1.1 will work with CMC license servers, which are Ansys-based."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two types of LS-DYNA jobs supported by the binaries?",
    "answer": "LS-DYNA provides binaries for running jobs on a single compute node (SMP - Shared Memory Parallel using OpenMP) or across multiple compute nodes (MPP - Message Passing Parallel using MPI)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you list available modules for running single node LS-DYNA jobs?",
    "answer": "Modules for running jobs on a single compute node can be listed with the command: `module spider ls-dyna`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you submit a single node LS-DYNA job to the queue?",
    "answer": "Jobs may be submitted to the queue with the command: `sbatch script-smp.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the effect of `LSTC_MEMORY=AUTO` in an LS-DYNA Slurm script for explicit analysis?",
    "answer": "For explicit analysis, `LSTC_MEMORY=AUTO` allows memory to be dynamically extended beyond the specified memory setting, potentially up to 25% if necessary, which is suitable for simulations like metal forming."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is memory calculated for implicit LS-DYNA jobs on a single node?",
    "answer": "For implicit analysis, the specified memory setting (e.g., 1500M) equates to a maximum amount of memory (e.g., 12GB for double precision) before LS-DYNA self-terminates. The ideal memory for implicit jobs on a single node is considered to be 75% of the total reserved RAM."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you calculate the `memory` parameter value in megawords for a double precision single node LS-DYNA job?",
    "answer": "For a double precision solution, the memory parameter value in megawords can be calculated as `(0.75 * memGB / 8 Bytes/word) * 1000M`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you calculate the `memory` parameter value in megawords for a single precision single node LS-DYNA job?",
    "answer": "For a single precision solution, the memory parameter value in megawords can be calculated as `(0.75 * memGB / 4 Bytes/word) * 1000M`."
