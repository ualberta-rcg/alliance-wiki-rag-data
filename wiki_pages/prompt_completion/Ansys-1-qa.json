  {
    "question": "What additional information is required from a local Ansys license server administrator if the server has never been set up for use with an Alliance cluster?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after the Alliance system administrator receives the required information for a 'Setup required' local license server?",
    "answer": "An Alliance system administrator will open the outbound cluster firewall to allow license checkout requests to reach the license server. They will then send back a range of IP addresses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What firewall configurations are required on the local license server side for initial setup with Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "The local network administrator needs to open the firewall into the local license server so that Ansys license connection (checkout requests) can reach the server's FLEXPORT and VENDPORT ports across the IP range provided by the Alliance."
