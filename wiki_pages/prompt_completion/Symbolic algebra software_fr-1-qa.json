    "question": "What is symbolic algebra software?",
    "answer": "Symbolic algebra software is an interactive application that works directly with symbolic expressions (like derivatives and integrals) and allows for exact arithmetic and formal operations in fields such as number theory, group theory, differential geometry, and commutative algebra."
  },
  {
    "question": "What additional capabilities do most symbolic algebra applications offer?",
    "answer": "Most of these applications also enable the use of approximate numerical calculation with floating-point numbers to solve problems that might otherwise be intractable."
