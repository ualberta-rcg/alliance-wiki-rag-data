  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of an SSH tunnel?",
    "answer": "An SSH tunnel allows the use of a gateway computer to connect two computers that cannot be directly connected to each other."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are SSH tunnels necessary for compute nodes like Niagara, B\u00e9luga, and Graham?",
    "answer": "SSH tunnels are necessary because the compute nodes of Niagara, B\u00e9luga, and Graham do not have direct internet access and cannot be contacted directly via the internet."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is an SSH tunnel typically required?",
    "answer": "An SSH tunnel is required for using commercial applications that need to contact an internet-based license server, for visualization or Jupyter Notebook applications on a compute node that a local client needs to contact, or for accessing Cedar's database server from a personal computer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the license server located when an SSH tunnel is used for a commercial application?",
    "answer": "The license server is located outside the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are SSH keys essential for using tunnels?",
    "answer": "No, SSH keys are not essential for using tunnels, but users might want to familiarize themselves with them."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a software port?",
    "answer": "A software port (identified by its number) allows distinguishing different interlocutors and is analogous to a radio frequency or channel. Many port numbers are reserved by obligation or convention for specific types of communication."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is an SSH tunnel used for commercial applications needing a license server when the compute node lacks internet access?",
    "answer": "When a compute node where an application is executed does not have internet access, an SSH tunnel is set up for port forwarding, using a gateway server with internet access to route communications from the compute node to the license server via a predetermined port."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is needed to set up an SSH tunnel for a license server?",
    "answer": "You will need the IP address or name of the license server (LICSERVER) and the license server's port number (LICPORT)."
  },
  {
    "question": "From whom can you obtain the license server information?",
    "answer": "This information can be obtained from the person who manages the license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the external IP addresses for Niagara that a license server must allow connections from?",
    "answer": "The external IP addresses for Niagara are 142.1.174.227 or 142.1.174.228."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an alternative solution for license server access on Graham?",
    "answer": "On Graham, an alternative solution would be to request a firewall exception for the LICSERVER and its port (LICPORT)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the gateway server for Niagara?",
    "answer": "The gateway server for Niagara is `nia-gw`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you choose a gateway server for Graham?",
    "answer": "For Graham, you should choose a connection node, such as `gra-login1`, `gra-login2`, etc."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the SSH command used to set up a port forwarding tunnel to a license server from a compute node?",
    "answer": "The SSH command in the script is `ssh GATEWAY -L COMPUTEPORT:LICSERVER:LICPORT -N -f`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-N` parameter in the SSH tunnel command?",
    "answer": "The `-N` parameter ensures that SSH does not open an interpreter on the GATEWAY."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of the `-f` and `-N` parameters together in the SSH tunnel command?",
    "answer": "The `-f` and `-N` parameters together prevent SSH from reading input data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `-f` parameter do in the SSH tunnel command?",
    "answer": "The `-f` parameter makes SSH run in the background, allowing subsequent commands to be executed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What term does a computer use to refer to itself?",
    "answer": "A computer uses the term `localhost` to refer to itself."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does an application typically know that the license server is available via the tunneled port on localhost?",
    "answer": "Often, it's done by defining an environment variable in the script, for example, `export MLM_LICENSE_FILE=COMPUTEPORT@localhost`."
