  {
    "question": "Why is it recommended to boot a persistent machine from a volume instead of an image?",
    "answer": "It is safest to boot a persistent machine from a volume because volume storage has redundancy, protecting the VM from hardware failure, whereas booting from an image stores the VM on the local disk of the actual machine, risking loss if the machine or its disk fails."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of VM flavors are typically used when booting from a volume?",
    "answer": "Typically, VM flavors starting with the letter 'p' are used when booting from a volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the different methods for booting a VM from a volume?",
    "answer": "You can boot from an image (creating a new volume), boot from a pre-existing volume, or boot from a volume snapshot (creating a new volume)."
  },
  {
    "question": "If you are new to booting VMs from volumes, which option is available to you?",
    "answer": "If you have not booted a VM from a volume before, the first option, 'boot from an image, creating a new volume', is your only choice."
  },
  {
    "question": "When launching a VM and creating a new volume, what setting ensures the volume persists longer than the VM?",
    "answer": "When creating a volume as part of the process of launching the VM, ensure that the 'Delete on Terminate' box is not checked if you want the volume to remain longer than the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of creating an image from a volume?",
    "answer": "Creating an image from a volume allows you to download the image for backup purposes or to spin up a VM on a different cloud, such as VirtualBox."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended method for copying a volume to a new volume within the same cloud?",
    "answer": "Cloning a volume is the recommended method for copying volumes within the same cloud."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a prerequisite for creating an image of a volume?",
    "answer": "To create an image of a volume, it must first be detached from a VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the considerations when creating an image from a boot (root) volume?",
    "answer": "If it is a boot (root) volume, it can only be detached from a VM if the VM is terminated/deleted, and you must ensure you have not checked 'Delete Volume on Instance Delete' when creating the VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might you consider separating data when dealing with large images?",
    "answer": "Large images (more than 10-20GB) may be very slow to create, upload, and otherwise manage, so separating data might be beneficial."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create an image from a volume using the OpenStack dashboard?",
    "answer": "From the 'Volumes' left-hand menu, under the desired volume, click on the 'Actions' drop-down menu and select 'Upload to Image', then choose a name, disk format, and click 'Upload'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which disk format is recommended for images within OpenStack, and which for VirtualBox?",
    "answer": "QCOW2 is recommended for using within the OpenStack cloud as it is compact and works well, while vmdk or vdi image formats might be better suited for use with Virtualbox."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command line instruction to create an image from a volume?",
    "answer": "The command line instruction is `openstack image create --disk-format <format> --volume <volume_name> <image_name>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is cloning a volume preferred over creating an image and then a new volume for copying?",
    "answer": "Cloning is much faster and requires less movement of data behind the scenes compared to making an image of an existing volume and using it to create a new volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key recommendation to ensure data consistency when cloning a volume?",
    "answer": "It is highly recommended to shut down your VM before creating a clone of the volume, as the newly created volume may be left in an inconsistent state if writing occurred to the source volume during the clone creation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the OpenStack command line client command for cloning a volume?",
    "answer": "The command to clone a volume using the OpenStack command line client is `openstack volume create --source <source-volume-id> --size <size-of-new-volume> <name-of-new-volume>`."
