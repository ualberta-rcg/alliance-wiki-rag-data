    "question": "Which Ansys module version is loaded in the `script-wbpj-2020.sh` for Workbench batch jobs?",
    "answer": "The script `script-wbpj-2020.sh` loads `StdEnv/2020` and `ansys/2021R2` or newer Ansys module versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is memory parallelism configured in `script-wbpj-2020.sh` for Ansys Workbench?",
    "answer": "If `$SLURM_NNODES` is 1, `MEMPAR` is set to 0 for Shared Memory Parallel (SMP); otherwise, it's set to 1 for Distributed Memory Parallel (DMP)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to run Ansys Workbench in batch mode from a Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The command to run Ansys Workbench in batch mode is `runwb2 -B -E \"Update()\" -F YOURPROJECT.wbpj`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an input file for Ansys Mechanical APDL be generated from an interactive Workbench Mechanical session?",
    "answer": "The input file can be generated by clicking 'Solution -> Tools -> Write Input Files' within an interactive Workbench Mechanical session, then specifying 'YOURAPDLFILE.inp' as the file name and 'APDL Input Files (*.inp)' as the save type."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are APDL jobs submitted to the queue?",
    "answer": "APDL jobs can be submitted to the queue by running the `sbatch script-name.sh` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `script-smp-2023-cpu.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The `script-smp-2023-cpu.sh` script is used for Shared Memory Parallel (SMP) CPU-based Ansys Mechanical APDL jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are loaded for the `script-smp-2023-cpu.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The `script-smp-2023-cpu.sh` script loads `StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2024R1.03`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the APDL solver invoked in `script-smp-2023-cpu.sh`?",
    "answer": "The APDL solver is invoked using `mapdl -smp -b nolist -np $SLURM_NTASKS -dir outdir-$SLURM_JOBID -i YOURAPDLFILE.inp`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `script-dmp-2023-cpu.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The `script-dmp-2023-cpu.sh` script is for Distributed Memory Parallel (DMP) CPU-based Ansys Mechanical APDL jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which MPI implementation is used for DMP CPU jobs on the Beluga cluster, according to `script-dmp-2023-cpu.sh`?",
    "answer": "On the Beluga cluster, Intel MPI is used for DMP CPU jobs (`mapdl -dis -mpi intelmpi ...`). For other clusters, Open MPI is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variable is exported for GPU-based Ansys Mechanical APDL jobs?",
    "answer": "The `ANSGPU_PRINTDEVICES=1` environment variable is exported for GPU-based Ansys Mechanical APDL jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default total and database memory allocations for APDL jobs, and how can they be changed?",
    "answer": "Ansys allocates 1024 MB total memory and 1024 MB database memory by default for APDL jobs. These can be changed by adding `-m <value>` and/or `-db <value>` arguments to the `mapdl` command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which license options might be necessary for APDL jobs using a remote institutional license server with multiple Ansys licenses?",
    "answer": "It may be necessary to add `-p aa_r` or `-ppf anshpc` to the `mapdl` command line, depending on the Ansys module being used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for running Ansys Mechanical jobs, SMP or DMP scripts?",
    "answer": "The single node (SMP Shared Memory Parallel) scripts will typically perform better than the multinode (DIS Distributed Memory Parallel) scripts and should be used whenever possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check the Workbench version used to generate an APDL input file?",
    "answer": "You can check the Workbench version used to generate an APDL input file by running `cat YOURAPDLFILE.inp | grep version`."
