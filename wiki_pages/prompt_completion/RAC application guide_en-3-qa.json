  {
    "question": "How is the minimum HPC Project storage calculated if resources are needed across multiple clusters?",
    "answer": "The minimum of 41 TB for HPC Project storage is the sum of all project storage needed across all eligible clusters, unlike CPU and GPU which require minimums per cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the 41 TB minimum for HPC Project storage apply to the Niagara cluster?",
    "answer": "No, the 41 TB minimum amount does not apply to the Niagara cluster; any amount of project storage needed on Niagara must be requested through the RAC."

    "question": "How is the minimum HPC Nearline storage calculated if resources are needed across multiple clusters?",
    "answer": "The minimum of 101 TB for HPC Nearline storage is the sum of all nearline storage needed across all eligible clusters, unlike CPU and GPU which require minimums per cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the 101 TB minimum for HPC Nearline storage apply to the HPSS cluster?",
    "answer": "No, the 101 TB minimum amount does not apply to the HPSS cluster; any amount of project storage needed on HPSS must be requested through the RAC."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a project request both project and nearline storage, and what are the conditions?",
    "answer": "Yes, project and nearline storage can both be requested as long as one of the requests is equal to or greater than its specified minimum. In that case, the online form must include both project and nearline storage resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum requirement for dCache storage in a RAC application?",
    "answer": "There is no minimum requirement for dCache storage; any amount requested must be included in the application."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum for Compute Cloud VCPU (VCPU-years) for a RAC application?",
    "answer": "The minimum requirement for Compute Cloud VCPU is 81 VCPU-years."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum for Compute Cloud VGPU (RGU-years) for a RAC application?",
    "answer": "The minimum requirement for Compute Cloud VGPU is 3.6 RGU-years."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum for Persistent Cloud VCPU (VCPU-years) for a RAC application?",
    "answer": "The minimum requirement for Persistent Cloud VCPU is 26 VCPU-years."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum for Volume and Snapshot Storage (TB) in the Cloud category?",
    "answer": "The minimum requirement for Volume and Snapshot Storage is 11 TB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum for Shared Filesystem Storage (TB) in the Cloud category?",
    "answer": "The minimum requirement for Shared Filesystem Storage is 11 TB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum for Object Storage (TB) in the Cloud category?",
    "answer": "The minimum requirement for Object Storage is 11 TB."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the rule for requesting multiple cloud resources at a single cloud site?",
    "answer": "As long as one of the resources needed in a particular cloud site is equal to or greater than its specified minimum, the entire request for that site is eligible. All cloud resources needed on that site must be included in the online form, even if some amounts are below the minimum listed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if there are discrepancies between the online application form and the attached Application Document regarding resource requests?",
    "answer": "In case of discrepancy, the amounts requested in the online form will prevail."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a project needs 180 core-years and 50 TB of project storage on Fir, what should be requested?",
    "answer": "The RAC application should only request 50 TB of storage on that cluster because the CPU request is below the minimum and may be obtainable without a RAC allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a project needs 500 core-years, 20 TB of project storage, and 80 TB of nearline storage on Narval, what should be requested?",
    "answer": "The RAC application should only request 500 core-years on Narval, as the storage needs are below the RAC minimums and can likely be met via the Rapid Access Service (RAS)."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a project needs 100 core-years with 10 TB of project storage on Trillium and 50 TB of nearline storage on HPSS, what should be requested?",
    "answer": "Only the 10 TB of project storage on Trillium and 50 TB of nearline storage on HPSS should be requested, as the CPU may be available without RAC and HPSS storage must be requested regardless of minimums."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a project needs 400 core-years, 30 RGU-years, and 200 TB of project storage on Nibi, what should be requested?",
    "answer": "All these resources must be requested in the RAC application because they are all above their respective minimum eligible amounts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is a request for 45 TB of project storage, split as 20 TB on Rorqual and 25 TB on Narval, eligible?",
    "answer": "Yes, this request is eligible because the total amount of project storage needed (45 TB) exceeds the 41 TB minimum."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a project needs a total of 100 TB of storage (50 TB project and 50 TB nearline on Fir), is it eligible, and what should be included?",
    "answer": "Yes, this request is eligible because the project storage (50 TB) is above its 41 TB minimum, even though nearline storage (50 TB) is below its 101 TB minimum. Both requests should be included in the application."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a project needs 100 VCPU of compute cloud resources, 5 TB of Volume and snapshot storage, and 5 TB of object storage on Arbutus, what should be requested?",
    "answer": "All these cloud resources should be requested in the online form. Since the 100 VCPUs exceed the minimum required (81 VCPU), the storage resources must be included in the same request even if their amounts are below 11 TB each."
