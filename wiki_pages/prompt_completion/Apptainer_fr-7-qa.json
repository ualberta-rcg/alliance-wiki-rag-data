    "question": "Is it always possible to build and run a Docker image without root or fakeroot permissions?",
    "answer": "If you only need a Docker image 'as is', you can often build and run it easily without root or `--fakeroot` permissions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if you need to modify an Apptainer image that was initially built from Docker without root access?",
    "answer": "If you need to modify the image later, you might require root permissions, for example, to use a package manager."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you build a SIF image from a Docker image using Apptainer?",
    "answer": "To build a SIF image from the latest busybox Docker image, you can use the command: `apptainer build bb.sif docker://busybox`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you build a sandbox directory instead of a SIF file from a Docker image?",
    "answer": "To build a sandbox, replace the SIF file name with `--sandbox DIR_NAME` or `-s DIR_NAME`. For example: `apptainer build --sandbox bb.dir docker://busybox`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key differences between an Apptainer SIF file and a sandbox directory?",
    "answer": "A SIF file is a single, compressed, read-only container image, while a sandbox is a directory containing individual, uncompressed, read-write files that can be numerous."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it recommended to use a SIF file over a sandbox for an Apptainer image?",
    "answer": "If you do not require frequent read-write access to the container image, it is recommended to use a SIF file because it offers faster access and consumes less disk quota than a sandbox."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the general recommendation for using Conda within an Apptainer container?",
    "answer": "Conda should be used as a last resort, even within a container. Prioritize modules from the software stack or available Python wheels, as they are optimized and offer better support."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is micromamba used in the Conda tutorial instead of Conda itself?",
    "answer": "Micromamba is used instead of Conda because Conda (Anaconda) has terms of service and commercial licensing conditions that users might need to consider."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of image is created in the tutorial for working with Conda?",
    "answer": "The tutorial creates a read-only SIF file containing a Conda environment with the necessary applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to install software interactively with Conda inside a container?",
    "answer": "It is strongly recommended not to install software interactively in a container with Conda."
