  {
    "question": "What Abaqus and environment modules should be loaded for a multi-node standard analysis job?",
    "answer": "You should load `StdEnv/2020` and `abaqus/2021` modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the MPI host list configured for an Abaqus multi-node standard analysis job?",
    "answer": "The `mp_host_list` is generated by parsing SLURM host information using `slurm_hl2hl.py --format MPIHOSTLIST`, formatted into a Python list, exported as an environment variable, and written to `abaqus_v6.env`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Abaqus command is used to submit a multi-node standard analysis job with MPI?",
    "answer": "The command is `abaqus job=testsp1-mpi input=mystd-sim.inp scratch=$SLURM_TMPDIR cpus=$SLURM_NTASKS interactive mp_mode=mpi`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of parallelization do Abaqus solvers support for explicit analysis?",
    "answer": "Abaqus solvers support thread-based and MPI-based parallelization for explicit analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are template scripts for performing multi-node job restarts provided for explicit analysis?",
    "answer": "No, template scripts to perform multi-node job restarts for explicit analysis are not currently provided."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the SLURM resource specifications for a single-node explicit analysis using the project directory script?",
    "answer": "The script specifies `--account=def-group`, `--time=00-06:00`, `--mem=8000M`, `--cpus-per-task=4`, and `--nodes=1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify writing restart data for a total of 12 time increments in an explicit analysis input file?",
    "answer": "Specify `*RESTART, WRITE, OVERLAY, NUMBER INTERVAL=12, TIME MARKS=NO` in the input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command checks for completed restart information in explicit analysis output files?",
    "answer": "Use `egrep -i \"step|restart\" testep*.com testep*.msg testep*.sta`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you restart a single-node explicit analysis job using the project directory restart script?",
    "answer": "The Abaqus command is `abaqus job=testep2 input=myexp-sim.inp recover scratch=$SLURM_TMPDIR cpus=$SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE interactive mp_mode=threads memory=\"$((${SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE}-3072))MB\"` after copying relevant files."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are input file modifications required for restarting an explicit analysis with the project directory restart script?",
    "answer": "No input file modifications are required to restart the analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `SLURM_TMPDIR` environment variable in temporary directory scripts for explicit analysis?",
    "answer": "The `SLURM_TMPDIR` environment variable is utilized so jobs that create large restart files can benefit by writing to the local disk."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the temporary directory script for single-node explicit analysis ensure data is saved during a long run?",
    "answer": "It uses a background process (`while sleep 6h; do cp -f * $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR 2>/dev/null; done &`) to periodically copy data from the temporary directory to the submit directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Abaqus command for starting an explicit analysis job with a temporary directory script?",
    "answer": "`abaqus job=testet1 input=$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR/myexp-sim.inp scratch=$SLURM_TMPDIR cpus=$SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE interactive mp_mode=threads memory=\"$((${SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE}-3072))MB\"`"
  },
  {
    "question": "How often does the temporary directory restart script for explicit analysis save data?",
    "answer": "It saves data every 3 hours by copying `testet2*` files back to the `$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What SLURM directives are typically used for a multi-node explicit analysis job?",
    "answer": "Typical SLURM directives include `--account=def-group`, `--time=00-06:00`, `--ntasks=8`, `--mem-per-cpu=16000M`, `--nodes=2` (optional), and `--cpus-per-task=1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which environment variable should be exported when using Abaqus/2021 for multi-node explicit analysis?",
    "answer": "You should `export I_MPI_HYDRA_TOPOLIB=ipl` when using abaqus/2021."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Abaqus command to execute a multi-node explicit analysis job with MPI?",
    "answer": "The command is `abaqus job=testep1-mpi input=myexp-sim.inp scratch=$SLURM_TMPDIR cpus=$SLURM_NTASKS interactive mp_mode=mpi`."
