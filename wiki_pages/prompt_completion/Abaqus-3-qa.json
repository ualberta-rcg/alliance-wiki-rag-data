    "question": "Which modules should be loaded for Abaqus 2021 for multi-node standard analysis?",
    "answer": "You should load `StdEnv/2020` and `abaqus/2021` modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variable is typically unset in a multi-node Abaqus standard analysis script?",
    "answer": "`SLURM_GTIDS` is typically unset."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a multi-node standard analysis script generate the `mp_host_list` for Abaqus?",
    "answer": "It uses `slurm_hl2hl.py` to get the hostlist, processes it to count nodes, formats it into `mp_host_list=[...]`, exports it, and writes it to `abaqus_v6.env`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to run Abaqus for a multi-node standard analysis job?",
    "answer": "The command is `abaqus job=testsp1-mpi input=mystd-sim.inp scratch=$SLURM_TMPDIR cpus=$SLURM_NTASKS interactive mp_mode=mpi`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What parallelization modes do Abaqus solvers support for explicit analysis?",
    "answer": "Abaqus solvers support thread-based and MPI-based parallelization for explicit analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are template scripts for multi-node explicit analysis job restarts currently provided?",
    "answer": "No, template scripts to perform multinode job restarts for explicit analysis are not currently provided pending further testing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical Slurm SBATCH parameters for a single-node explicit analysis project directory script?",
    "answer": "Typical parameters include `--account=def-group`, `--time=00-06:00`, `--mem=8000M`, `--cpus-per-task=4`, and `--nodes=1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are loaded in the single-node explicit analysis project directory script?",
    "answer": "`StdEnv/2020` and `abaqus/2021` are loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify writing restart data for a total of 12 time increments in an explicit analysis input file?",
    "answer": "In the input file, specify `*RESTART, WRITE, OVERLAY, NUMBER INTERVAL=12, TIME MARKS=NO`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check for completed restart information in explicit analysis output files?",
    "answer": "Run `egrep -i \"step|restart\" testep*.com testep*.msg testep*.sta` to check the relevant output files."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is input file modification required to restart an explicit analysis from a project directory?",
    "answer": "No input file modifications are required to restart the analysis when using the project directory restart script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `while sleep 6h` loop in the temporary directory script for explicit analysis?",
    "answer": "It periodically saves data from the temporary directory back to the submit directory every 6 hours to prevent data loss due to time limits."
  },
  {
    "question": "How often does the temporary directory restart script save data during an explicit analysis job?",
    "answer": "It saves data from the temporary directory back to the submit directory every 3 hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment variable should be exported when using Abaqus 2021 for multi-node explicit analysis?",
    "answer": "`I_MPI_HYDRA_TOPOLIB=ipl` should be exported when using `abaqus/2021`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the optional `mp_host_split` argument used for in multi-node explicit analysis?",
    "answer": "`mp_host_split` (if uncommented) specifies the number of dmp processes per node, which should be greater than or equal to 1."
