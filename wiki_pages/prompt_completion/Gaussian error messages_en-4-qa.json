    "question": "What does the error 'Variable index of 3000 on card XXX is out of range, NVar=XX' indicate in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error signifies an input problem where a variable in the Z-matrix was forgotten from the list, as exemplified by atom #15 in the provided output."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I fix the 'Variable index out of range' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you need to add the missing variable to your Z-matrix list."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the cause of the 'Unknown center XXX' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This is an input error that occurs when you try to define an atom in a Z-matrix using another atom name that does not exist, like 'X' in the example."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you resolve an 'Unknown center XXX' error in a Gaussian job?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you should correct the atom name in your input file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the error 'Determination of dummy atom variables in z-matrix conversion failed' mean?",
    "answer": "This error means that Gaussian failed to convert from redundant internal coordinates back to Z-matrix coordinates due to issues with dummy atoms."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the 'Determination of dummy atom variables in z-matrix conversion failed' error addressed?",
    "answer": "The geometry optimization converged, but Gaussian couldn't convert back to the input z-matrix, indicating you may need to use Cartesian coordinates instead."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does Gaussian report 'malloc failed'?",
    "answer": "This indicates that the computer has run out of memory, typically because the amount specified in the `%mem` line was too high."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve a 'malloc failed' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You can resolve this error by either reducing the amount of memory specified with `%mem` in the Gaussian input file or by increasing the amount of memory requested in the job script using `--mem=`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'Charge and multiplicity card seems defective' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This is an input error that occurs if the title line is omitted when using `geom=modify`. Gaussian then misinterprets the charge/multiplicity line as the title and the variable list as the charge/multiplicity."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you fix the 'Charge and multiplicity card seems defective' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "To fix this error, you need to include a title line in your input."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the reason for the 'Attempt to redefine unrecognized symbol \"XXXXX\"' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This input error happens when you use `geom=modify` to attempt to change a variable that is not present in the checkpoint file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I fix the 'Attempt to redefine unrecognized symbol' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "To fix this, ensure you are specifying either the correct checkpoint file or the correct variable that exists within it."
