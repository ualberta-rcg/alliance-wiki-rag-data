  {
    "question": "How do clusters differ from local machines for machine learning applications?",
    "answer": "Clusters use a distributed filesystem, linking many storage devices seamlessly, and IO operations have very different performance implications compared to a local machine."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is important to consider when managing data on clusters?",
    "answer": "You need to choose wisely where to put your data due to different performance implications of IO operations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a self-paced course available for machine learning on SHARCNET?",
    "answer": "Yes, a self-paced course titled 'Introduction to Machine Learning' is available from SHARCNET."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find a tutorial for porting my program to use on one of the clusters?",
    "answer": "You can take 'our tutorial' for porting your program for using on one of our clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a user-made tutorial for setting up deep learning environments in Python?",
    "answer": "Yes, a user-made tutorial showing all the steps necessary for setting up your local and Alliance environments for deep learning in Python is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find important information about Python on the clusters?",
    "answer": "Refer to 'our documentation about Python' for information on Python versions, virtual environments, multiprocessing, Anaconda, and Jupyter."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should users use Anaconda on the clusters for machine learning?",
    "answer": "Users are asked to avoid using Anaconda and use virtualenv instead."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it easy to switch from Anaconda to virtualenv?",
    "answer": "Switching to virtualenv is easy in most cases; just install all the same packages, except CUDA, CuDNN, and other low-level libraries, which are already installed on the clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find information about specific machine learning software packages like TensorFlow or PyTorch?",
    "answer": "Refer to the page of your machine learning package of choice for useful information about how to install, common pitfalls, etc."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of storage options are available on the clusters?",
    "answer": "Our clusters offer a wide range of storage options, including high-speed temporary local storage and different kinds of long-term storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more documentation on storage and file management?",
    "answer": "Refer to our documentation on 'Storage and file management'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended storage strategy for datasets 10 GB or less?",
    "answer": "If your dataset is around 10 GB or less, it can probably fit in memory, and you should not read data from disk during your machine learning tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended storage strategy for datasets around 100 GB or less?",
    "answer": "If your dataset is around 100 GB or less, it can fit in the local storage of the compute node; transfer it there at the beginning of the job as this storage is faster and more reliable than shared storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is a temporary directory available for each job on a compute node?",
    "answer": "A temporary directory is available for each job at $SLURM_TMPDIR."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the considerations for datasets larger than 100 GB?",
    "answer": "If your dataset is larger than 100 GB, you may have to leave it in shared storage like your project space for permanent storage, or scratch space which can be faster but is not for permanent storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the characteristics of shared storage (home, project, scratch) regarding read/write frequency?",
    "answer": "All shared storage is for storing and reading at low frequencies, such as 1 large chunk every 10 seconds, rather than 10 small chunks every second."
  },
  {
    "question": "What problems can arise when managing datasets with lots of small files (e.g., image datasets)?",
    "answer": "Problems include filesystem quotas limiting the number of objects and significant slowdowns from streaming lots of small files from /project or /scratch to a compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should data be stored on a distributed filesystem if it consists of many small files?",
    "answer": "Data should be stored in large single-file archives on a distributed filesystem."
