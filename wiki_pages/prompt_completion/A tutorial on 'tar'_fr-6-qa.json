    "question": "How do you extract a single file from a `.tar` archive to a specific destination directory?",
    "answer": "To extract a single file from a `.tar` archive to a specific destination, use the `tar -C [destination_directory] --extract --file=[archive_name].tar [path_to_file_in_archive]` command. For example: `tar -C ./new_results/ --extract --file=results.tar results/Res-01/log.15Feb16.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the behavior of the `--extract` option when extracting a single file from a tar archive?",
    "answer": "The `--extract` option allows a specific file to be extracted from an archive without decompressing the entire archive, and it will recreate the archive's directory structure in the destination directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it mandatory to use the `-C` option when extracting a single file or directory from a tar archive?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is absolutely necessary to use the `-C` option for the destination directory; otherwise, the file will be extracted to the same directory where the archive is located, if it exists."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can multiple files be extracted from a `.tar` archive at once using the extraction command?",
    "answer": "Yes, multiple files can be extracted by adding their full paths after the archive file name, for example: `tar -C ./new_results/ --extract --file=results.tar \"results/Res-01/log.15Feb16.4\" \"file2\" \"file3\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a single file from a `*.gz` compressed tar archive to a specific directory?",
    "answer": "Use the command `tar -C [destination_directory] --extract -z --file=[archive_name].tar.gz [path_to_file_in_archive]`. For example: `tar -C ./new_results/ --extract -z --file=results.tar.gz results/Res-01/log.15Feb16.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a single file from a `*.bz2` compressed tar archive to a specific directory?",
    "answer": "Use the command `tar -C [destination_directory] --extract -j --file=[archive_name].tar.bz2 [path_to_file_in_archive]`. For example: `tar -C ./new_results/ --extract -j --file=results.tar.bz2 results/Res-01/log.15Feb16.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you extract multiple files matching a wildcard pattern from a `.tar` archive to a specified directory?",
    "answer": "To extract multiple files using wildcards, use the `--wildcards` option with the pattern. For example, to extract all `.dat` files from the 'results' directory to `new_results/`: `tar -C ./new_results/ -xvf results.tar --wildcards \"results/*.dat\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can wildcards be used when extracting files from compressed tar archives (e.g., `.gz` or `.bz2`)?",
    "answer": "Yes, the command for extracting files with wildcards is also valid with the `-j` or `-z` options for compressed archives."
