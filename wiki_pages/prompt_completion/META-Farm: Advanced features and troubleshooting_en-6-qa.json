    "question": "What might cause the 'lockfile is not on path on node XXX' error if the utility is present on the login node?",
    "answer": "If 'lockfile' is in your $PATH on a login node, but the error occurs on a compute node, it suggests something went wrong on that particular compute node, such as a file system failing to mount."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the message 'Exiting after processing one case (-1 option)' signify?",
    "answer": "This is not an error message; it indicates that the farm was submitted using `submit.run -1` (one case per job mode), causing each meta-job to exit after processing a single case."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the message 'Not enough runtime left; exiting.' mean?",
    "answer": "This message indicates that a meta-job has determined it likely does not have enough time remaining to process the next case, based on its runtime analysis, and thus exits early."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is 'No cases left; exiting.' an error message?",
    "answer": "No, this is not an error message; it is the normal way each meta-job finishes once all cases have been computed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what condition does the message 'Only failed cases left; cannot auto-resubmit; exiting' appear?",
    "answer": "This message appears only if the `-auto` switch was used when submitting the farm, indicating that auto-resubmission has stopped because only failed cases remain."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps should be taken when the 'Only failed cases left; cannot auto-resubmit; exiting' message is displayed?",
    "answer": "You should use `Status.run -f` to find the failed cases, fix the issues causing them to fail, and then manually run `resubmit.run`."
