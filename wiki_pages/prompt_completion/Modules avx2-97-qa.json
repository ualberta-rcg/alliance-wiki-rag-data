    "answer": "PHAST is a freely available software package designed for comparative and evolutionary genomics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of the PHON program?",
    "answer": "The PHON program calculates force constant matrices and phonon frequencies in crystals."
  },
  {
    "question": "What thermodynamic quantities can PHON calculate?",
    "answer": "From phonon frequencies, PHON can calculate the Helmholtz free energy, entropy, specific heat, and internal energy of the harmonic crystal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What method does PHON use for its calculations?",
    "answer": "PHON's procedure is based on the small displacement method and can be used with any program capable of calculating forces on crystal atoms."

  {
    "question": "What is Photospline?",
    "answer": "Photospline is a library that uses the penalized spline technique to efficiently compute, store, and evaluate B-spline representations of multi-dimensional histograms."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Photospline help with data analysis from Monte Carlo simulations?",
    "answer": "Photospline helps in efficiently computing, storing, and evaluating B-spline representations of multi-dimensional histograms, which arise from Monte Carlo simulations and can otherwise be numerically problematic due to size, unfilled bins, or interpolation artifacts."
