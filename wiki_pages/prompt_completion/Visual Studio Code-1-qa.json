  {
    "question": "What is the recommended approach for using VS Code to avoid issues on login nodes?",
    "answer": "Whenever possible, strictly use VS Code locally or configure it as described in the documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should you avoid running or debugging code on remote systems connected to Visual Studio Code?",
    "answer": "Running or debugging code on remote systems will execute code on the login nodes, which can lead to performance issues or system disruptions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What environment should be used for safer debugging tasks when Visual Studio Code is connected to remote systems?",
    "answer": "Instead of running or debugging directly on remote systems, use the `code-server` environment, which provides a safer and more appropriate context for debugging tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended ways to work with VS Code and remote systems?",
    "answer": "You can use VS Code locally and save changes with Git, use `nano` or `vim` to edit files directly on systems, load the `code-server` module for debugging/quick testing, or configure VS Code for remote connections if other options are not possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of using VS Code locally?",
    "answer": "Local usage offers speed and stability due to fewer network interruptions, direct access to files, extensions, and terminals with zero latency, and offline capability, allowing you to code without an internet connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should you test a locally developed project on the systems?",
    "answer": "Once ready, save changes to a Git repository, push them to a remote host (like GitHub or GitLab), connect to the system, and pull your changes to test."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to connect to a system via terminal?",
    "answer": "The command is `ssh <username>@<hostname>.alliancecan.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you get your project files onto the system if the repository doesn't exist?",
    "answer": "You can clone your repository using `git clone git@github.com:username/reponame.git`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you update your project files on the system if the repository already exists?",
    "answer": "Change directory to your repository using `cd myrepo` and then pull the changes using `git pull`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should changes be tested after being pulled onto the system?",
    "answer": "Changes should be tested in a short interactive job with minimal resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What terminal-based editors are recommended for direct file editing on remote systems?",
    "answer": "Terminal-based editors like `nano` or `vim` are recommended for direct file editing from the command line on remote systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a graphical interface alternative for file editing on the systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, the JupyterLab text editor provides a versatile graphical alternative that supports Markdown, Python scripts, and other formats."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you debug or test code on the systems?",
    "answer": "You can start a `code-server` instance from Jupyter Lab."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to launch a `code-server` instance from Jupyter Lab?",
    "answer": "Access one of the options to launch JupyterLab, select minimal resources and start an interactive JupyterLab job, then on the Launcher tab, click on the VS Code launcher button."

  {
    "question": "Does a `code-server` instance running in a compute job have internet access?",
    "answer": "No, the `code-server` instance running in a compute job does not have internet access."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are custom extensions available for the `code-server` module?",
    "answer": "The `code-server` module has several common extensions already available, and more can be added upon request."
  },
  {
    "question": "When would you configure VS Code for remote connection?",
    "answer": "One can configure VS Code to connect to a remote host with the Remote SSH extension if other recommended methods do not work for their case."
  },
  {
    "question": "What SSH-related steps are needed before configuring VS Code for remote connection?",
    "answer": "You need to generate your SSH key and add your public SSH key on the CCDB, if not already done."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step for local configuration in VS Code for remote connections?",
    "answer": "In VS Code, open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you apply local configuration settings in VS Code?",
    "answer": "Open the user settings (`Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`) and paste or merge the provided configuration, then save and restart VS Code."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step for remote system configuration?",
    "answer": "Log in to the system via an external terminal using `ssh <username>@<host>.alliancecan.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What directory needs to be created on the remote system for VS Code server configuration?",
    "answer": "You need to create the directory `~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create the `settings.json` machine configuration file on the remote system?",
    "answer": "Use the command `nano ~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json` and then copy the provided configuration, merging manually if existing settings are present."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to a remote host using VS Code after configuration?",
    "answer": "Open the Command Palette, type `remote`, select `Connect to Host...`, choose the host (remote system), and confirm."
