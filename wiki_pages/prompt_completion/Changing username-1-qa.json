    "question": "Is changing a username a simple process?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What are valid reasons to request a username change?",
    "answer": "A valid reason for a username change is a real name change or when a software license is tied to a specific username."

  {
    "question": "What happens automatically to folder structures on the filesystems when a username is changed?",

  {
    "question": "Can I immediately connect to clusters with my new username after it's changed?",
    "answer": "You will be able to connect to the clusters using your new username and existing password or SSH key, but you should not do so until you receive notification that it is okay, as manual adjustments are required."
  },
  {
    "question": "What needs to be done manually with existing files on the filesystems after a username change?",

  {
    "question": "How should users handle data backed up on tape if they need to recover it after a username change?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What manual steps are required for jobs in the scheduler when a username is changed?",

    "question": "How are helpdesk tickets handled when a username changes?",
    "answer": "Since a new username is seen as a new user, existing helpdesk tickets associated with the old username need to be manually assigned to the new user by a helpdesk administrator."

    "question": "What is the user's responsibility regarding their own scripts after a username change?",
    "answer": "If users have any scripts that hardcode their username, they are responsible for adjusting those themselves."

    "question": "What adjustments are needed for cloud projects when a user's username is changed?",
    "answer": "If the user owns cloud projects, a cloud administrator must manually rename these projects and their resources (like internal networks, virtual routers) to match the new username, and reapply any access permissions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will project names (e.g., 'def-username') be automatically updated if a principal investigator's username changes?",
    "answer": "No, if the user being renamed is a principal investigator, the names of their projects will not be updated automatically; renaming projects is a separate process."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are old log entries mapped to a new username?",

  },
