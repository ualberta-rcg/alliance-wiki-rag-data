  {
    "question": "Do Jupyter kernels running on compute nodes have internet access?",
    "answer": "No, the compute nodes running the Jupyter kernels do not have internet access."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations due to the lack of internet access on Jupyter compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Users can only transfer files from/to their own computer; they cannot download code or data from the internet (e.g., 'git clone', 'pip install' if the wheel is absent) and may have problems with code that performs downloads or uploads."

  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the cloud-based hubs for universities and schools?",
    "answer": "The hubs are hosted on Alliance clouds and are essentially for training purposes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can institutions interested in obtaining their own JupyterHub visit?",
    "answer": "Institutions interested in obtaining their own hub can visit http://syzygy.ca."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after a user logs into JupyterHub, depending on its configuration?",
    "answer": "The user's web browser is redirected to either a previously launched Jupyter server, a new Jupyter server with default options, or a form to set different options before starting."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of job is equivalent to accessing resources through JupyterHub?",
    "answer": "It is equivalent to accessing requested resources via an interactive job on the corresponding cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many interactive jobs receive a priority increase on a cluster at one time?",
    "answer": "Only one interactive job at a time gets a priority increase on each cluster to start in a few seconds or minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of interactive jobs are included in the priority increase?",
    "answer": "This includes `salloc`, `srun`, and JupyterHub jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What might happen if a user has an interactive job running while trying to start a new Jupyter session?",
    "answer": "If a user already has another interactive job running on the same cluster, their new Jupyter session may never start before the time limit of 5 minutes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Name some of the 'Server Options' available on B\u00e9luga's JupyterHub.",
