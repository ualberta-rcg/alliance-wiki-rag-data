    "question": "Where does the software environment expect CUDA driver libraries to be located?",
    "answer": "The software environment relies on CUDA driver libraries being installed in the path `/usr/lib64/nvidia`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the issue when recent NVidia drivers install libraries in `/usr/lib64` instead of `/usr/lib64/nvidia`?",
    "answer": "If NVidia drivers install libraries in `/usr/lib64` instead, it's not possible to add `/usr/lib64` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` without pulling in all system libraries, which could cause incompatibilities."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended solution for CUDA library location conflicts?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to create symbolic links in `/usr/lib64/nvidia` that point to the installed NVidia libraries in `/usr/lib64`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can NVidia drivers and symbolic links be set up on a Red Hat system for CUDA?",
    "answer": "A provided script for Red Hat systems uses `yum` to install NVidia driver packages and then creates symbolic links from `/usr/lib64` to `/usr/lib64/nvidia` for the installed library files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can NVidia drivers and symbolic links be set up on an Ubuntu system for CUDA?",
    "answer": "A provided script for Ubuntu first ensures the `/usr/lib64/nvidia/` directory exists, and then creates symbolic links from `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` to `/usr/lib64/nvidia` for the installed library files."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the software environment recommend using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`?",
    "answer": "No, defining `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not recommended and can lead to the environment not working, as the software environment is designed to use RUNPATH instead."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might binary packages like Anaconda fail to find libraries?",
    "answer": "Binary packages, such as Anaconda, may not find expected libraries because the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not defined and the software environment's libraries are not installed in default Linux locations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more information about installing binary packages?",
    "answer": "More information about installing binary packages can be found in the documentation on 'Installing binary packages' under 'Installing software in your home directory'."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is `dbus` required, and where should it be installed?",
    "answer": "`dbus` needs to be installed locally on the host operating system for some applications."
