  {
    "question": "What is the consequence of using `srun` in a job submission script?",
    "answer": "If `srun` is used in a submission script, an `.0` step is created, which consumes almost all resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `.ext+` step in job records?",
    "answer": "The `.ext+` step is primarily for the prologue and epilogue and typically does not consume a large amount of resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a node fails during a job's execution?",
    "answer": "If a node fails during job execution, the job may be relaunched."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does `sacct` display information for a job that was relaunched due to a node failure?",
    "answer": "`sacct` normally shows only the last record for the last (presumed successful) execution."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view all execution records for a job in `sacct`, including re-runs after a node failure?",
    "answer": "To consult all records relating to a job, add the `--duplicates` option to `sacct`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information does the `MaxRSS` field provide?",
    "answer": "The `MaxRSS` field indicates the amount of memory used by a job, specifically returning the value of the largest resident set size."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which fields should be printed along with `MaxRSS` to identify the specific task and node involved?",
    "answer": "To know the task and node involved, you should also print the `MaxRSSTask` and `MaxRSSNode` fields."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which command is used to get information about the state of a running job?",
    "answer": "The `sstat` command provides information on the state of a running job."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which command is used to obtain information about completed jobs?",
    "answer": "The `sacct` command is used for tasks that have been completed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to connect to a node where a job is running and execute new processes?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to connect to a node where a job is running and execute new processes."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what purposes is connecting to a running job's node useful?",
    "answer": "This is particularly useful for troubleshooting operations or to follow the progress of a job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What utility is used to monitor GPU usage on a node during a job's execution?",
    "answer": "The `nvidia-smi` utility is employed to monitor GPU usage on a node where a task is running."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example command to monitor GPU usage every 30 seconds for a specific running job.",
    "answer": "`srun --jobid 123456 --pty watch -n 30 nvidia-smi`"
  },
  {
    "question": "How can multiple monitoring commands be launched simultaneously for a job?",
    "answer": "Multiple commands can be launched using `tmux`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Give an example command using `tmux` to monitor CPU (`htop`) and GPU (`nvidia-smi`) activity for a running job.",
    "answer": "`srun --jobid 123456 --pty tmux new-session -d 'htop -u $USER' \\; split-window -h 'watch nvidia-smi' \\; attach`"
  },
  {
    "question": "Do processes launched via `srun` for monitoring share resources with the main job?",
    "answer": "Yes, processes launched with `srun` share the resources used by the job in question."
  },
  {
    "question": "What potential issue should be avoided when launching additional processes on a node with a running job?",
    "answer": "One should avoid launching processes that would use resources to the detriment of the main job."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the risks if monitoring processes consume too many resources?",
    "answer": "If processes use too many resources, the job could be stopped, and using too many CPU cycles will slow down a job."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do the `srun` monitoring examples provided work for interactive jobs?",
    "answer": "No, `srun` in these examples works only on jobs submitted with `sbatch`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should an interactive job be monitored?",
    "answer": "To monitor an interactive job, open multiple windows with `tmux` and start the processes in distinct windows."
