  {
    "question": "How can I list only my own jobs on the cluster?",
    "answer": "You can use the `sq` command to list only your own jobs, or `squeue -u $USER`."

    "answer": "You can find more information about `squeue` or `sq` output in the online manual page for `squeue`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to run `sq` or `squeue` frequently from a script?",
    "answer": "No, it is strongly advised not to run `sq` or `squeue` from a script or program at high frequency (e.g., every few seconds), as it adds load to Slurm and can interfere with its performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does the output of a Slurm job go by default?",
    "answer": "By default, the output is placed in a file named \"slurm-\", suffixed with the job ID number and \".out\" (e.g., `slurm-123456.out`), in the directory from which the job was submitted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I specify a different name or location for my job's output file?",
    "answer": "You can use the `--output` directive to specify a different name or location for the output file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can error output be sent to a separate file instead of the standard output file?",
    "answer": "To send the standard error channel (stderr) to a separate file, you can use the `--error` directive."

    "question": "When does the scheduler automatically assign an account to a job?",
    "answer": "If you are a member of only one account, the scheduler will automatically associate your jobs with that account."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I receive a message indicating I am associated with multiple CPU or GPU allocations?",
    "answer": "In this case, you must use the `--account` directive (e.g., `#SBATCH --account=def-user-ab`) to specify one of the accounts listed in the error message."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I find the correct account name to use with the `--account` directive for a Resource Allocation Project?",
    "answer": "You can find the correct account name by logging in to CCDB, clicking on 'My Projects -> My Resources and Allocations', and looking under the 'Group Name' column for your project."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a Resource Allocation Project (RAP) account name be used across all clusters?",
    "answer": "No, a Resource Allocation Project may only apply to a specific cluster or set of clusters and may not be transferable from one cluster to another."
