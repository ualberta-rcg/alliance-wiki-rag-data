    "question": "What is the general command for checking the status of Slurm jobs?",
    "answer": "The general command for checking the status of Slurm jobs is `squeue`, but `sq` is a shorter, locally customized command to list only your own jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I view only my own jobs in the Slurm system?",
    "answer": "You can use the `sq` command to list only your own jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the 'PD' and 'R' statuses mean in the `squeue` output?",
    "answer": "In the `ST` column of the `squeue` output, 'PD' stands for pending, and 'R' stands for running."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it advisable to run `sq` or `squeue` commands frequently from a script?",
    "answer": "No, you should not run `sq` or `squeue` from a script or program at high frequency (e.g., every few seconds) because it adds load to Slurm and may interfere with its performance or correct operation. Email notification is a better alternative."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the output of a Slurm job stored by default?",
    "answer": "By default, the output is placed in a file named `slurm-<job ID>.out` (e.g., `slurm-123456.out`), located in the directory from which the job was submitted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I specify a custom name or location for my job's output file?",
    "answer": "You can specify a different name or location for the output file by using the `--output` directive."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use dynamic values in the output filename, like the job ID?",
    "answer": "Yes, certain replacement symbols like the job ID number, job name, or job array task ID can be used in a filename specified with the `--output` directive."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I redirect standard error (stderr) to a separate file for a Slurm job?",
    "answer": "If you want to send the standard error channel (stderr) to a separate file, you should use the `--error` directive."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required for every job submission regarding accounts?",
    "answer": "Every job must have an associated account name corresponding to a Resource Allocation Project (RAP)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if I have access to multiple accounts and need to specify one for a job?",
    "answer": "If you are associated with multiple allocations, you should use the `--account` directive in your job script (e.g., `#SBATCH --account=def-user-ab`) to specify one of the accounts listed in the error message."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I find the correct account name for a Resource Allocation Project (RAP)?",
    "answer": "To find the account name, log in to CCDB, click on 'My Account -> My Resources and Allocations', and look for the 'Group Name' column associated with your project."
