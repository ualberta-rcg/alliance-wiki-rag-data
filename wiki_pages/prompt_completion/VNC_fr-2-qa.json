    "question": "What is the path to the X509 CA Certificate for TigerVNC Viewer on Debian or Ubuntu?",
    "answer": "For Debian and Ubuntu, the path to the X509 CA Certificate is `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the path to the X509 CA Certificate for TigerVNC Viewer on Fedora, CentOS, or RHEL?",
    "answer": "For Fedora, CentOS, or RHEL, the path to the X509 CA Certificate is `/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure TigerVNC Viewer saves the configured security settings?",
    "answer": "After setting the path to the X509 CA Certificate and clicking 'OK', you must click 'Connect' for the parameters to be saved."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main types of VNC servers you can connect to?",
    "answer": "You can connect to a persistent vncserver on a dedicated VDI node (e.g., Graham) or a vncserver that you start on a compute node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is VNC suitable for heavy computing tasks?",
    "answer": "No, VNC is not designed for heavy tasks; a light session on a login node is often sufficient for less demanding applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the collective name for Graham's two dedicated VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Graham's two dedicated VDI nodes are collectively known as `gra-vdi`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of environment do Graham's VDI nodes provide?",
    "answer": "Graham's VDI nodes provide a remote desktop environment equipped with accelerated OpenGL, intended for demanding and complex interactive graphical tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which file systems do the VDI nodes share with Graham?",
    "answer": "The VDI nodes share the `/home`, `/project`, and `/scratch` file systems of Graham."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can data created on Graham be accessed on `gra-vdi`?",
    "answer": "All data files or directories created on Graham during job execution are immediately accessible on `gra-vdi` for visualization and post-processing without needing to be transferred."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect to `gra-vdi` using TigerVNC?",
    "answer": "Start VNC (tigervnc) on your computer and enter `VNC server: gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you connect directly to a specific VDI machine instead of the general `gra-vdi` address?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can connect directly by specifying `VNC server: gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca` or `VNC server: gra-vdi4.sharcnet.ca`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the reasons to connect directly to `gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca` or `gra-vdi4.sharcnet.ca`?",
    "answer": "Direct connection can be useful if one machine is overloaded and unresponsive, or if you want to systematically use the local `$SCRATCH` directory on a specific server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `$SCRATCH` directory on `gra-vdi` used for, and what is its data retention policy?",
    "answer": "On `gra-vdi`, `$SCRATCH` is defined as `/local/tmp/$USER`. Data left there will eventually be deleted due to limited disk space, and files should not be stored there for more than 60 days."
  },
  {
    "question": "If you need to perform long-duration calculations using a graphical application, where should you connect instead of `gra-vdi`?",
    "answer": "You should disconnect from `gra-vdi` and connect to a compute node on any cluster instead."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to move long-duration GUI calculations off VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Moving long-duration GUI calculations off VDI nodes ensures that memory and processor resources remain fully available for other users to perform their own graphical tasks without performance impact."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can you start a VNC server on a login node?",
    "answer": "You can start a VNC server on a login node for less demanding applications that require little memory, CPU time, or GPU, as login nodes have imposed limits on these resources."
