  {
    "question": "What is SQLite?",
    "answer": "SQLite is software that provides a relational database entirely contained within a single file on disk, without requiring a database server."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can data be accessed in an SQLite database?",
    "answer": "Data in an SQLite file can be accessed using standard SQL (Structured Query Language) commands like `SELECT`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which programming languages support APIs for SQLite?",
    "answer": "APIs for interacting with an SQLite database are available for C/C++, Python, R, Java, and Perl."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it practical to store many small image files in SQLite?",
    "answer": "Yes, storing a collection of 5 or 10 million small image files (like PNG or JPEG) inside a single SQLite file can be much more practical than storing them as individual files, due to modern relational databases handling 'binary blobs'."
  },
  {
    "question": "When does SQLite performance degrade?",
    "answer": "The performance of SQLite can start to degrade for very large database files, typically several gigabytes or more."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the executable name for SQLite and how is it available?",
    "answer": "The SQLite executable is `sqlite3`, and it is available via the `nixpkgs` module, which is loaded by default on the systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can parallel compression be used when creating an archive?",
    "answer": "When creating an archive from many files, `pigz` can be used instead of `gzip` for parallel compression. For example, `tar -vc --use-compress-program=\"pigz -p 4\" -f dir.tar.gz dir_to_tar` compresses the archive using 4 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract only a specific folder from a gzipped tar archive?",
    "answer": "To extract a specific folder (e.g., `dir/subdir`) from a gzipped tar archive to a local disk (e.g., `$SLURM_TMPDIR`), you can use the command: `tar -zxf /path/to/archive.tar.gz dir/subdir --directory $SLURM_TMPDIR`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can Git repository performance be improved and the size of the .git directory be managed?",
    "answer": "Using `git repack` will pack many of the files in the hidden `.git` repository subdirectory into a few large database files, which greatly speeds up Git's operations and manages the directory size."
