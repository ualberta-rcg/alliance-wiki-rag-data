    "question": "What are the limitations for running jobs with the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET Ansys license permits each researcher to run a maximum of 8 simultaneous jobs using up to 512 hpc cores across all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide examples of maximum core combinations for SHARCNET Ansys jobs?",
    "answer": "Yes, allowed maximum even-sized combinations include 1x512, 2x256, 4x128, or 8x64 simultaneous jobs across all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if a job fails due to a SHARCNET license shortage?",
    "answer": "If a job fails on startup due to a shortage of licenses, it needs to be manually resubmitted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What measures might be taken if many SHARCNET Ansys license shortages are reported?",
    "answer": "If many license shortages are reported, the total job limit per researcher may be decreased (to 6 or 4), and/or the total hpc core limit per researcher may be decreased (to 384 or 256 cores)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a researcher do if they need more than 512 hpc cores for their Ansys research?",
    "answer": "Researchers needing more than 512 hpc cores should consider using their institution's local ANSYS License server if available, and potentially contributing to its expansion."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of purchasing an Ansys license subscription from CMC?",
    "answer": "Benefits include not needing a local institutional license server, not needing to obtain and reconfigure a physical license annually, the ability to use the license almost anywhere (home, institutions, or any Alliance cluster), and access to installation instructions for Windows machines to run SpaceClaim."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical core limit per user for CMC Ansys licenses according to their Quick Start Guides?",
    "answer": "According to the CMC Ansys Quick Start Guides, there may be a 64 core limit per user."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I configure my `ansys.lic` file to use the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "You need to configure your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file with the following lines: `setenv(\"ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE\", \"1055@license3.sharcnet.ca\")` and `setenv(\"ANSYSLI_SERVERS\", \"2325@license3.sharcnet.ca\")`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I check the number of SHARCNET Ansys licenses in use by my username and all users?",
    "answer": "To check, run `ssh graham.computecanada.ca`, then `module load ansys`, followed by `lmutil lmstat -c $ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE -a | grep \"Users of|$USER\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if Ansys licenses are unexpectedly tied up by my username on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Connect to the specific gra-vdi node (e.g., `gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca` or `gra-vdi4.sharcnet.ca`) via TigerVNC, open a terminal window, and run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys\"` to terminate rogue processes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to specify the full hostname when connecting to gra-vdi via TigerVNC to kill rogue processes?",
    "answer": "It is necessary because gra-vdi consists of two nodes (gra-vdi3 and gra-vdi4), and researchers are randomly placed on one. Specifying the full hostname ensures you log into the correct node to run `pkill`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the choices for loading Ansys modules when using gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Researchers can choose to load Ansys modules from the global environment (after loading CcEnv) or from modules installed locally on the machine itself (after loading SnEnv)."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are settings from `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` used with local Ansys modules on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Settings from `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` are only used when `-gui` is appended to the Ansys program name (e.g., `fluent-gui` instead of `fluent`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended uses for Ansys on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Suitable usage includes running a single job interactively (in the GUI or from the command line) with up to 8 cores and 128GB RAM, creating or modifying simulation input files, and post-processing or visualizing data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load and use a local Ansys module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "First, connect to `gra-vdi.computecanada.ca` with TigerVNC. Then, open a new terminal window and load a module (e.g., `module load SnEnv ansys/2024R2`). Finally, directly start an Ansys program from the command line (e.g., `runwb2` or `fluent-gui`)."
