    "answer": "On gra-vdi, Ansys module versions 2025R1 or newer are only installed under CcEnv, not SnEnv."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there known issues with Ansys Mechanical GUI in version 2025R1 on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Yes, the GUI interface for some programs like Ansys Mechanical in version 2025R1 does not work properly on gra-vdi and will not be fixed as gra-vdi is to be retired soon."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I load and run Ensight on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To load Ensight on gra-vdi, run `module load SnEnv` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions back to 2021R2), then run `ensight`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I launch Ansys Rocky in GUI mode on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "After loading the appropriate Rocky and Ansys modules (e.g., `module load clumod ansysrocky/2024R2.0 CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys/2024R2.04`), you can launch the GUI by running `Rocky-gui`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Ansys Rocky utilize GPUs when run on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Rocky should only be used with CPUs and not GPUs when run on gra-vdi, as the machine only has one GPU intended for graphics."
