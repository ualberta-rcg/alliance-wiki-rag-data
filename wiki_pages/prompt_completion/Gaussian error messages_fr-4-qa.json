  {
    "question": "What does the error message 'Convergence failure -- run terminated' indicate in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error indicates that the SCF (self-consistent field) procedure did not achieve convergence."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the potential causes for a 'Convergence failure -- run terminated' error in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "Causes include a weak `guess=read` for molecular orbitals, a geometry weakness (e.g., bonds that are too long or too short), or a poorly executed step in the optimization process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a 'Convergence failure -- run terminated' error be resolved if it's due to a weak `guess=read`?",
    "answer": "You can try to obtain a better `guess=read` by running an SCF procedure with the same starting structure but a lower theoretical level (e.g., HF/STO-3G). If that doesn't work, use a different convergence procedure like `SCF=QC` or `SCF=XQC`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the solution for a 'Convergence failure -- run terminated' error caused by geometry issues?",
    "answer": "The problem can often be resolved by modifying the initial geometry, especially if any bonds are either much too long or much too short."
  },
  {
    "question": "If a 'Convergence failure -- run terminated' error results from a flawed optimization step, what should be done?",
    "answer": "Resubmit the job using the penultimate (or an earlier) geometry and request a new evaluation of the Hessian matrix."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is indicated by the Gaussian error 'FOPT requested but NVar= XX while NDOF= YY'?",
    "answer": "This error means that a full optimization (FOpt) was requested, but a check for the correct number of variables detected an error."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'FOPT requested but NVar= XX while NDOF= YY' error if NDOF is smaller than NVar?",
    "answer": "If NDOF is smaller than NVar, the molecule is being run with a lower symmetry than it actually possesses. The solution is to increase the symmetry."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes the 'FOPT requested but NVar= XX while NDOF= YY' error if NVar is smaller than NDOF?",
    "answer": "If NVar is smaller than NDOF, your Z-matrix has too many constraints for the symmetry being considered."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the variable count check be bypassed when the 'FOPT requested but NVar= XX while NDOF= YY' error occurs?",
    "answer": "Yes, the check can be bypassed by using `Opt` instead of `FOpt`, though this is generally not recommended."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the error 'Unable to project read-in occupied orbitals' signify in Gaussian?",
    "answer": "This error indicates that Gaussian attempted to read the molecular orbital guess from a checkpoint file, but the projection from the old basis to the new one failed."
  },
  {
    "question": "When does the 'Unable to project read-in occupied orbitals' error typically occur?",
    "answer": "It can occur when certain pseudopotential bases (like CEP-121G*) are used with polarization functions, but these functions do not actually exist, or when Gaussian uses temporary polarization functions with zero exponents."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended solution for the 'Unable to project read-in occupied orbitals' error if using CEP-121G*?",
    "answer": "A solution is to use CEP-121G instead of CEP-121G*, as they are identical for many elements."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'Unable to project read-in occupied orbitals' problem be circumvented?",
    "answer": "You can bypass this problem by avoiding the use of the 'guess' feature."
