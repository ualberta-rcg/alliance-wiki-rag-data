  {
    "question": "What should I do if the Ansys Workbench GUI or its programs freeze or fail to start, especially after a vncviewer disconnection?",
    "answer": "If Ansys is not functioning correctly, open a new terminal window on gra-vdi and run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|fluent|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE|mono\"` to stop all Ansys processes. If the problem persists and you previously used the GUI on compute nodes, try running `rm -rf .ansys`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What could be causing Ansys issues if I also notice problems with /home, /project, or /scratch directories?",
    "answer": "If the problem involves /home, /project, or /scratch (e.g., the `df` command blocks), it is very likely a storage problem, and Ansys should resume normal operation once the storage issue is resolved."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I launch Ensight on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Load the `SnEnv` module, then `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions back to 2021R2), and then execute the `ensight` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are used to run Rocky on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To run Rocky on gra-vdi, you can load either `clumod ansysrocky/2023R2 CcEnv StdEnv/2020 ansys/2023R2`, `clumod ansysrocky/2024R2.0 CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys/2024R2.04`, or `CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys/2025R1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I launch Rocky on gra-vdi using my custom license file?",
    "answer": "After loading the necessary modules, simply run the `Rocky` command. The Ansys module will automatically read your `~/licenses/ansys.lic` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users select between CMC or SHARCNET license servers when starting the Rocky GUI on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Use the `Rocky-gui` command, which is provided by the local ansysrocky modules and allows for the selection of CMC or SHARCNET license servers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to run the Rocky solver directly from the command line?",
    "answer": "The `RockySolver` command is used to run the Rocky solver directly from the command line, though adding `-h` for help has not been tested."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `RockySchedular` command used for on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "The `RockySchedular` command launches the graphical interface for submitting and executing tasks on the current node, although it is not yet tested."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Rocky version 2024R2 and older available on all clusters?",
    "answer": "Rocky version 2024R2 and older versions are currently available only on gra-vdi and Graham clusters. Installation on all clusters is planned for June."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Rocky 2025R1 supported on all clusters and by the SHARCNET license server?",
    "answer": "Rocky 2025R1 and newer versions are provided on all clusters via the Ansys module, but they are not yet supported by the SHARCNET license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Rocky utilize GPUs on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "No, Rocky can only use CPUs on gra-vdi because there is currently only one GPU dedicated to graphics."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the SHARCNET license free for Rocky usage in research?",
    "answer": "Yes, the SHARCNET license now includes Rocky, and its use is free for research."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Ansys GUI programs be run remotely via SSH X redirection?",
    "answer": "Yes, some Ansys GUI programs can be run remotely on a compute node via SSH X redirection to your local computer. However, this approach is neither tested nor supported, as it relies on a properly configured X display server or an appropriate X client emulator like MobaXterm."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical performance issues when running Ansys GUI programs via SSH?",
    "answer": "Most users will find interactive response times unacceptable even for basic menu tasks, and especially for complex tasks requiring graphical rendering. Startup times can also be very long, depending on your internet connection; for example, a test showed it took 40 minutes via SSH compared to 34 seconds with vncviewer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances might using SSH for Ansys GUI programs still be acceptable, despite its potential slowness?",
    "answer": "Despite the potential slowness, using SSH for Ansys GUI programs can still be useful if your only objective is to open a simulation and perform basic menu operations or execute calculations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the basic steps to attempt running an Ansys GUI program via SSH X redirection?",
    "answer": "The basic steps are: 1) `ssh -Y username@graham.computecanada.ca`; 2) `salloc --x11 --time=1:00:00 --mem=16G --cpus-per-task =4 [--gpus-per-node=1] --account=def-mygroup`; 3) once connected to a compute node, try running `xclock`. If the clock appears, load the desired Ansys module and then run the program."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I verify if SSH X redirection is working after connecting to a compute node?",
    "answer": "After connecting to a compute node via `salloc --x11`, try executing the `xclock` command. If the clock appears on your desktop, X redirection is working."

  {
    "question": "Where can I find more information about Rocky Innovation Space?",
    "answer": "You can find more information at the Rocky Innovation Space page: [https://innovationspace.ansys.com/ais-rocky/](https://innovationspace.ansys.com/ais-rocky/)."
