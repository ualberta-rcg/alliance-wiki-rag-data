    "question": "What is the primary function of NetCDF, and which programming languages are supported by its various MPI-enabled libraries?",
    "answer": "NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. The `netcdf-c++4-mpi` module supports C++, `netcdf-fortran-mpi` supports Fortran, and `netcdf-mpi` offers compatibility with Python versions 3.10 and 3.11."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions are available for the `netcdf-fortran` module?",
    "answer": "The available versions for the `netcdf-fortran` module are 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.6.0, and 4.6.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which programming language is the `newmat` C++ library designed for, and what are its key applications?",
    "answer": "The `newmat` C++ library is designed for C++ and is intended for scientists and engineers who need to manipulate a variety of matrices using standard matrix operations. It emphasizes operations needed in statistical calculations like least squares, linear equation solve, and eigenvalues."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is `NextDenovo` and what kind of sequencing reads does it assemble?",
    "answer": "NextDenovo is a string graph-based de novo assembler that handles long reads, specifically CLR, HiFi, and ONT sequencing data. It uses a \"correct-then-assemble\" strategy, requiring fewer computing resources than tools like `canu`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Python versions are compatible with the `neuron` software?",
    "answer": "The `neuron` software is compatible with Python versions 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can `netcdf-mpi` be used with Python, and if so, what extensions are available?",
    "answer": "Yes, `netcdf-mpi` is compatible with Python versions 3.10 and 3.11. It includes extensions such as `certifi-2023.7.22`, `cftime-1.6.2`, and `netCDF4-1.6.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage for the `netcdf-c++4-mpi` module?",
    "answer": "The homepage for the `netcdf-c++4-mpi` module is https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the description of the `neuron` module?",
    "answer": "The `neuron` module provides empirically-based simulations of neurons and networks of neurons."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which versions of `netcdf-mpi` are currently available?",
    "answer": "The currently available versions for `netcdf-mpi` are 4.7.4, 4.8.0, 4.8.1, 4.9.0, and 4.9.2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary goal of `NextDenovo`'s assembly strategy?",
    "answer": "The primary goal of `NextDenovo`'s assembly strategy is to rapidly assemble raw long reads (CLR, HiFi, and ONT) using a \"correct-then-assemble\" approach, which requires significantly less computing resources and storage compared to other assemblers like `canu`, while still providing high per-base accuracy (98-99.8%)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the homepage for the `newmat` library?",
    "answer": "The homepage for the `newmat` library is http://www.robertnz.net/index.html."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of software is the `netcdf-fortran-mpi` module?",
    "answer": "The `netcdf-fortran-mpi` module is classified as an 'io' (input/output) type software."
