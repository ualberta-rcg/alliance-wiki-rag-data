  {
    "question": "What Egress rules are included in the default security group?",
    "answer": "The default security group includes two Egress rules, one for IPV4 and one for IPV6, allowing your instance to access an outside network without any limitation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Ingress rules are included in the default security group?",
    "answer": "The default security group includes two Ingress rules, one for IPV4 and one for IPV6, to allow communication for all VMs that belong to that security group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it safe to remove rules from the default security group?",
    "answer": "It is not recommended to remove rules from the default security group as this may cause problems when creating new VMs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can new rules be added to the default security group?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is safe to add rules to the default security group, such as security rules for SSH or RDP."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a VM be a member of more than one security group?",
    "answer": "Yes, a VM can belong to more than one security group."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a best practice when managing Ingress rules for security groups?",
    "answer": "Strive to minimize the IP addresses and ports in your Ingress rules, only allowing what needs to be accessed and who needs to access it."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can SSH access to a VM be limited to a specific computer with a static IP?",
    "answer": "You can allow SSH access only from that specific static IP by using the CIDR box to specify the allowed IP or IP range."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can you choose the security groups a VM belongs to?",
    "answer": "Security groups for a VM can be chosen when it is created using the 'Security Groups' option during 'Launch Instance', or after the VM has been launched by selecting 'Edit Security Groups' from the drop-down menu on the 'Project->Compute->Instances' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does CIDR stand for?",
    "answer": "CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of a CIDR rule?",
    "answer": "A CIDR rule is a standardized way of defining IP ranges."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the '/24' component of a CIDR rule like '192.168.1.1/24' work?",
    "answer": "The '/24' in a CIDR rule like '192.168.1.1/24' means that the rule will match the first 24 bits (3 bytes) of an IP address. For example, any IP address starting with 192.168.1 will match this rule."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does appending '/32' to an IP address in a CIDR rule signify?",
    "answer": "If '/32' is appended to an IP address in a CIDR rule, the full 32 bits of the IP address must match exactly, meaning it matches only that specific IP address."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does appending '/0' to an IP address in a CIDR rule mean?",
    "answer": "If '/0' is appended to an IP address in a CIDR rule, no bits must match, and therefore any IP address will match it."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can you use cloudInit to customize a VM instance?",
    "answer": "You can customize an instance using cloudInit the first time your instance is launched."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two ways to customize an instance using cloudInit?",
    "answer": "Customization with cloudInit can be done either via the OpenStack command-line interface or by pasting your cloudInit script into the 'Customization Script' field of the OpenStack dashboard."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you add multiple users to a VM during creation using cloudInit?",
    "answer": "You can add multiple users by including a 'users' section in your cloudInit script, specifying 'name', 'shell', 'sudo' permissions, and 'ssh_authorized_keys' for each user."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is important to remember about whitespace when writing cloudInit scripts in YAML format?",
    "answer": "YAML is very picky about whitespace formatting, for example, there must be a space after the '-' before your public key string."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the default user if a cloudInit script is used to define new users without including 'users: - default'?",
    "answer": "The cloudInit configuration overwrites the default user that is added when no cloudInit script is specified, making the users listed in the script the *only* users on the newly created VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it vital to have at least one user with sudo permission when defining users via cloudInit?",
    "answer": "It is vital to have at least one user with sudo permission because the cloudInit configuration, if not preserving the default user, will make the specified users the only ones on the VM, and administrative tasks would require sudo access."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you preserve the default user created by the distribution while adding new users with cloudInit?",
    "answer": "To preserve the default user, include `users: - default` at the beginning of the `users` section in your cloudInit script, before listing the additional users."
