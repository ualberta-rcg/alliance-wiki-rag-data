    "answer": "A project is unique to a particular cloud."
  },
  {
    "question": "What level of permissions do members of an OpenStack project have?",
    "answer": "All accounts which are members of a project have the same level of permissions, meaning anyone can create or delete a VM within a project if they are a member."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user view the projects they are a member of?",
    "answer": "Users can view the projects they are a member of by logging into an OpenStack dashboard for the clouds they have access to."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the active project name displayed on the OpenStack dashboard?",
    "answer": "The active project name will be displayed in the top left of the dashboard, to the right of the cloud logo."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user switch between active projects in the dashboard?",
    "answer": "If a user is a member of more than one project, they can switch between active projects by clicking on the drop-down menu and selecting the project's name."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do allocation types affect VM flavors within an OpenStack project?",
    "answer": "Depending on the allocation, a project may be limited to certain types of VM flavors; for example, compute allocations generally only allow 'c' flavors, while persistent allocations generally only allow 'p' flavors."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is considered the owner of OpenStack projects?",
    "answer": "Projects can be thought of as owned by primary investigators (PIs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can request new OpenStack projects and quota adjustments?",
    "answer": "New projects and quota adjustments can only be requested by Primary Investigators (PIs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required for a user to gain access to an existing OpenStack project?",
    "answer": "A request for access to an existing project must be confirmed by the PI owning the project."

    "answer": "More information about creating and managing disk image files can be found on the 'Working with images' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find information about managing VM characteristics in the dashboard?",
    "answer": "More information about managing certain characteristics of your VMs in the dashboard can be found on the 'Working with VMs' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of availability zones in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "Availability zones allow you to indicate what group of physical hardware you would like your VM to run on."
  },
  {
