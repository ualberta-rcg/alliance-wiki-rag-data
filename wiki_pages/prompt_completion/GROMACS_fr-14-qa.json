    "question": "What is the status of the Colvars library in GROMACS v2024 and later versions?",
    "answer": "Starting from GROMACS v2024, the Colvars library is added to the official versions without having to rely on a patched version."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find documentation for Collective Variable simulations using the Colvars module?",
    "answer": "Documentation is available in the GROMACS manual under 'Collective Variable simulations with the Colvars module' and 'Molecular dynamics parameters (.mdp options) for the Colvars module', as well as in the 'Reference manual for GROMACS'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are required to use GROMACS v2020.6 with Colvars for CPU-based calculations?",
    "answer": "The modules required are `StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 openmpi/4.0.3 gromacs-colvars/2020.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I enable GPU (CUDA) support for GROMACS v2020.6 with Colvars?",
    "answer": "To enable GPU support, load the modules `StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 cuda/11.4 openmpi/4.0.3 gromacs-colvars/2020.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is CP2K?",
    "answer": "CP2K is a quantum chemistry and solid-state physics software package."
  },
  {
    "question": "Since when can GROMACS support hybrid quantum-classical (QM/MM) simulations with CP2K?",
    "answer": "Since 2022, GROMACS can be compiled to support hybrid quantum-classical (QM/MM) simulations with CP2K."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do `gromacs-cp2k` modules support GPU (CUDA) calculations?",
    "answer": "No, `gromacs-cp2k` modules can be used only for CPU calculations and not with GPU (CUDA)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which MPI-compatible executables are included in `gromacs-cp2k` modules?",
    "answer": "The `gromacs-cp2k` modules include `gmx_mpi` for mixed precision with OpenMP and MPI, and `gmx_mpi_d` for double precision with OpenMP and MPI."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are needed to run GROMACS v2022.2 with CP2K?",
    "answer": "The modules needed are `StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 openmpi/4.0.3 gromacs-cp2k/2022.2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find documentation on Hybrid Quantum-Classical (QM/MM) simulations with the CP2K interface in GROMACS?",
    "answer": "Documentation can be found in the GROMACS Reference manual, under the section 'Hybrid Quantum-Classical simulations (QM/MM) with CP2K interface'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an important modification to make when following BioExcel QM/MM tutorials for GROMACS+CP2K on our systems?",
    "answer": "When following BioExcel QM/MM tutorials, you must replace `gmx_cp2k` with `gmx_mpi` (mixed precision) or `gmx_mpi_d` (double precision) and modify job scripts to be supported by Slurm."
