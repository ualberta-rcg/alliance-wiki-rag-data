    "question": "Who signed the license agreement for the MRCC Software?",
    "answer": "The Alliance signed a license agreement with Prof. Dr. Mihaly Kallay, who acts for the developers of the MRCC Software."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first condition for using MRCC on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "The first condition is to use MRCC only for academic research."
  },
  {
    "question": "Am I allowed to copy the MRCC software according to the license agreement?",
    "answer": "No, users agree not to copy the MRCC software, nor make it available to anyone else."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should users do regarding publications when using MRCC?",
    "answer": "Users must properly acknowledge original papers related to MRCC and to the Alliance in their publications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the agreement for using MRCC be terminated?",
    "answer": "Yes, the agreement can be terminated by one of the parties: MRCC developers or the Alliance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the latest MRCC version available?",
    "answer": "The MRCC version from \"2023-08-28\" is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the MRCC module on the clusters?",
    "answer": "You can load the module by running: `module load intel/2023.2.1  openmpi/4.1.5 mrcc/20230828`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of support does the MRCC module include?",
    "answer": "The module was installed with OpenMP and MPI support."
  },
  {
    "question": "What becomes accessible once the MRCC module is loaded?",
    "answer": "Once the module is loaded, users can access all the binaries and the basis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find detailed documentation for MRCC?",
    "answer": "Detailed documentation about the usage of the program is available on the MRCC website at https://www.mrcc.hu/index.php/documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a forum available for MRCC users?",
    "answer": "Yes, the MRCC forum at https://www.mrcc.hu/index.php/forum is another useful source of information about the program."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the process to agree to the MRCC usage conditions on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "Users must contact support with a copy of the required statement to agree to the conditions."
