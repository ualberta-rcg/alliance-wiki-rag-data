  {
    "question": "What needs to be done before a local institutional Ansys license server can be used on the Alliance?",
    "answer": "Firewall changes will need to be done on both the server and cluster side."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information should be collected from a local Ansys license server administrator for a server that is already set up for use?",
    "answer": "You need the fully qualified hostname (LICSERVER), the Ansys flex port (FLEXPORT, commonly 1055), and the Ansys licensing interconnect port (INTEPORT, commonly 2325)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure your Ansys license file for a 'ready-to-use' local server?",
    "answer": "Configure your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file by plugging the collected values for LICSERVER, FLEXPORT, and INTEPORT into the `FILE: ansys.lic` template."
  },
  {
    "question": "What additional information is required from the administrator if a local Ansys license server has never been set up for use on the Alliance?",
    "answer": "In addition to the hostname and port numbers, you will need the static vendor port (VENDPORT) number and confirmation that the `<servername>` will resolve to the same IP as LICSERVER on Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important for the `<servername>` in the license file to resolve to the same IP as LICSERVER on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "It is required because Ansys license checkouts will not work on any remote cluster at the Alliance if the `<servername>` does not resolve to the same IP as LICSERVER."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if the `<servername>` does not meet the IP resolution requirement?",
    "answer": "You should request your license administrator to change `<servername>` to either the same fully qualified hostname as LICSERVER or at least to a hostname that will resolve to the same IP address as LICSERVER remotely."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted to initiate the setup of a new local Ansys license server for use on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "You should send the collected information (hostname, FLEXPORT, INTEPORT, VENDPORT) by email to technical support, specifying which Alliance cluster(s) you want to run Ansys jobs on."
  },
  {
    "question": "What will Alliance system administrators do after receiving the license server setup request?",
    "answer": "Alliance system administrators will proceed to open the firewall so license checkout requests can reach your license server from the specified cluster(s) compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information will the user receive to configure the local firewall for Ansys license connections?",
    "answer": "You will receive a range of IP addresses to forward to your server administrator, who can then open the local firewall to permit inbound Ansys license connections from the cluster(s) on EACH of the ports defined by FLEXPORT, INTEPORT, and VENDPORT."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you test if your `ansys.lic` file is configured and working properly on a cluster?",
    "answer": "You can test it by copying/pasting a sequence of commands on the cluster you are submitting jobs to, including `salloc`, `module load`, and `lmutil lmstat -c $ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific change is needed in the license testing command sequence?",
    "answer": "The only required change is to specify your YOURUSERID."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to use the correct Ansys module version when testing the license configuration?",
    "answer": "To be certain that license checkouts will work when jobs are run in the queue, the same Ansys module version that you load in your Slurm scripts should be specified during the test."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a 'Success' output indicate after running the license check command?",
    "answer": "If `Success` is output, license checkouts should work when jobs are submitted to the queue."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if the license check command outputs 'Fail'?",
    "answer": "If `Fail` is output, jobs will likely fail, requiring a problem ticket to be submitted to resolve the issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are Ansys simulations typically backwards compatible?",
    "answer": "No, Ansys simulations are typically NOT backwards compatible, meaning a simulation created with a newer version will likely not run smoothly with an older version."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are Ansys simulations typically forward compatible?",
    "answer": "Yes, Ansys simulations are typically forward compatible, meaning simulations created using an older version of Ansys can be expected to load and run fine with any newer version."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you find out which version of Ansys was used to create a Fluent `.cas` file?",
    "answer": "You can try grepping the `.cas` file for the string 'fluent' to look for clues about the version."
