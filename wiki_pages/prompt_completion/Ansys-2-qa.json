    "question": "What information is needed to configure a local institutional Ansys license server that is already set up on an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "You need to contact your local Ansys license server administrator to obtain the configured Ansys flex port (FLEXPORT) number and the fully qualified hostname (LICSERVER) of the license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I configure my `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file for a 'ready to use' local institutional Ansys license server?",
    "answer": "You simply plug the FLEXPORT and LICSERVER values into the `FILE: ansys.lic` template after obtaining them from your local Ansys license server administrator."
  },
  {
    "question": "What additional information is required if a local Ansys license server has never been set up for use with an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "You will need the statically configured vendor port (VENDPORT) of the license server and confirmation that `<servername>` (found in the first line of the license file) resolves to the same IP address as LICSERVER on the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to set up a local Ansys license server that has never been used with an Alliance cluster?",
    "answer": "You need to send the FLEXPORT, LICSERVER, and VENDPORT (items 1-3) by email to technical support, mention the Alliance cluster you want to use, and then work with your local network administrator to open firewalls for the specified IP range so license checkout requests can reach your server."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I test if my `ansys.lic` file is configured and working properly on a cluster?",
    "answer": "You can test it by running a sequence of commands on the cluster: `cd /tmp`, `salloc --time=1:0:0 --mem=1000M --account=def-YOURUSERID`, `module load StdEnv/2023; module load ansys/2023R2`, and then `$EBROOTANSYS/v$(echo ${EBVERSIONANSYS:2:2}${EBVERSIONANSYS:5:1})/licensingclient/linx64/lmutil lmstat -c $ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE 1> /dev/null && echo Success || echo Fail`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the indication of a successful license checkout test?",
    "answer": "If `Success` is output, it indicates that license checkouts should work when jobs are submitted to the queue."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if the license checkout test outputs `Fail`?",
    "answer": "If `Fail` is output, jobs will likely fail, and you should submit a problem ticket to resolve the issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to use the same Ansys module version for license testing as for Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "To be certain the license checkouts will work when jobs are run in the queue, you should specify the same Ansys module version that you load in your Slurm scripts because a failure can occur if the remote license server software has not been updated for the latest module version."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are Ansys simulations forward or backward compatible?",
    "answer": "Ansys simulations are typically forward compatible but NOT backwards compatible."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'forward compatible' mean for Ansys simulations?",
    "answer": "It means that simulations created using an older version of Ansys can be expected to load and run fine with any newer version."
  },
  {
    "question": "What could happen if I try to run an Ansys simulation created with a newer version using an older Ansys version?",
    "answer": "While it may be possible to start the simulation, random error messages or crashing will likely occur."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I find out which version of Ansys Fluent was used to create a `.cas` or `.cas.h5` file?",
    "answer": "You can try grepping the file, for example, `$ grep -ia fluent combustor.cas` or `$ grep -ia fluent cavity.cas.h5`, to look for clues about the Fluent version."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find detailed platform support information for Ansys software and hardware compatibility?",
    "answer": "Ansys provides detailed platform support information for the Current Release and Previous Releases on its website."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the 'Platform Support by Application / Product' PDF useful for?",
    "answer": "It is of special interest because it shows which Ansys packages are supported under Windows but not under Linux, and therefore not on the Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Ansys Spaceclaim supported on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "No, Spaceclaim is not supported on Alliance clusters as it runs under Windows, and Alliance systems are Linux-based."
