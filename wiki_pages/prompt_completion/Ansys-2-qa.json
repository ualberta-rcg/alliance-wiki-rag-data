  {
    "question": "What initial steps are required before a local institutional Ansys license server can be used on the Alliance?",
    "answer": "Firewall changes need to be made on both the license server side and the cluster side."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is needed from an Ansys license server administrator if the server is already set up for use on the Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "You will need the fully qualified hostname (LICSERVER), the Ansys flex port (FLEXPORT), and the Ansys licensing interconnect port (INTEPORT)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure the `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file for an Ansys license server that is ready to use?",
    "answer": "You need to plug the LICSERVER, FLEXPORT, and INTEPORT values obtained from your administrator into the `FILE: ansys.lic` template."
  },
  {
    "question": "What additional information is required from an administrator if a local Ansys license server has never been set up for use on the Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "In addition to the hostname, flex port, and interconnect port, you will also need the static vendor port (VENDPORT) number and confirmation that the `<servername>` in the license file resolves to the same IP as LICSERVER on Alliance clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important for the `<servername>` in the license file to resolve to the same IP as LICSERVER on Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "It is required; otherwise, Ansys license checkouts will not work on any remote cluster at the Alliance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if the `<servername>` does not resolve to the same IP as LICSERVER?",
    "answer": "You should request your license administrator to change `<servername>` to either the same fully qualified hostname as LICSERVER or a hostname that resolves to the same IP address as LICSERVER remotely."
  },
  {
    "question": "After collecting the necessary license server information for a new setup, who should be contacted and with what details?",
    "answer": "You should send the hostname, flex port, interconnect port, and static vendor port by email to [[technical support]], mentioning which Alliance cluster(s) you want to run Ansys jobs on."
  },
  {
    "question": "What actions will Alliance system administrators take after receiving a request to set up a new Ansys license server?",
    "answer": "Alliance system administrators will open the firewall to allow license checkout requests to reach your license server from the specified cluster(s) compute nodes. They will then provide you with a range of IP addresses to forward to your server administrator."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should the local server administrator do with the IP addresses provided by the Alliance technical team?",
    "answer": "The server administrator should open the local firewall to permit inbound Ansys license connections from the specified cluster(s) on each of the ports defined by FLEXPORT, INTEPORT, and VENDPORT."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you test if your `ansys.lic` file is configured and working correctly?",
    "answer": "You can copy and paste a sequence of commands on the cluster, starting with `cd /tmp`, allocating a salloc job, loading the appropriate Ansys module, and then running `lmutil lmstat -c $ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE 1> /dev/null && echo Success || echo Fail`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a 'Success' output indicate when checking the Ansys license?",
    "answer": "If 'Success' is output, license checkouts should work when jobs are submitted to the queue."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a 'Fail' output indicate when checking the Ansys license, and what action should be taken?",
    "answer": "If 'Fail' is output, jobs will likely fail, requiring a problem ticket to be submitted to resolve the issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is important to consider regarding the Ansys module version when testing license checkouts on a remote server?",
    "answer": "To ensure license checkouts work when jobs are run in the queue, the same Ansys module version that you load in your Slurm scripts should be specified during the license test."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are Ansys simulations typically forward or backward compatible?",
    "answer": "Ansys simulations are typically forward compatible but NOT backwards compatible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a simulation created with an older version of Ansys be run with a newer version?",
    "answer": "Yes, simulations created using an older version of Ansys can be expected to load and run fine with any newer version."
  },
  {
    "question": "What might happen if you try to run a simulation created with a newer Ansys version using an older Ansys version?",
    "answer": "It may be possible to start, but random error messages or crashing will likely occur."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you determine which Ansys version was used to create a Fluent .cas file?",
    "answer": "You can try grepping the .cas file for clues, for example, using `$ grep -ia fluent combustor.cas`."
