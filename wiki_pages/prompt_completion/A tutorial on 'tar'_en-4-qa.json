  },
  {
    "question": "What file extension is typically used for files compressed with `gzip`?",
    "answer": "Files compressed with `gzip` typically have `.gz` as the file name extension, or `.tar.gz` and `.tgz` for archived files."

    "question": "How do you compress a single file using the `bzip2` command?",
    "answer": "To compress a single file like `new.log.dat` using `bzip2`, you would use the command `bzip2 new.log.dat`."

  {
    "question": "What file extension is typically used for files compressed with `bzip2`?",
    "answer": "Files compressed with `bzip2` typically have `.bz2` as the file name extension, or `.tar.bz2` and `.tbz` for archived files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you create a `tar` archive and compress it with `gzip` in a single step?",
    "answer": "To create a `tar` archive and compress it with `gzip` simultaneously, use the `tar` command with the `-z` option, for example: `tar -cvzf results.tar.gz results/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you create a `tar` archive and compress it with `bzip2` in a single step?",
    "answer": "To create a `tar` archive and compress it with `bzip2` simultaneously, use the `tar` command with the `-j` option, for example: `tar -cvjf results.tar.bz2 results/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to add files directly to an already compressed archive like `.tar.gz` or `.tar.bz2`?",
    "answer": "No, files cannot be added directly to compressed archives (`*.gz` or `*.bz2`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the procedure for adding files to a compressed archive?",
    "answer": "To add files to a compressed archive, you must first decompress it (using `gunzip` or `bunzip2`), then add the files to the resulting plain `.tar` archive using the `-r` option, and finally compress it again (using `gzip` or `bzip2`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract the entire contents of an uncompressed `.tar` archive?",
    "answer": "To unpack or extract an entire uncompressed `.tar` archive, use the `tar -xvf` command, for example: `tar -xvf results.tar`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a `.tar` archive to a specific destination directory?",
    "answer": "To extract a `.tar` archive to a specific destination directory, use the `-C` option, for example: `tar -xvf results.tar -C new_results/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to decompress files with a `.gz` extension?",
    "answer": "For files with a `.gz` extension, use the `gunzip` command, such as `gunzip new.log.dat.gz` or `gunzip results.tar.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to decompress files with a `.bz2` extension?",
    "answer": "For files with a `.bz2` extension, use the `bunzip2` command, such as `bunzip2 new.log.dat.bz2` or `bunzip2 results.tar.bz2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a compressed `tar.gz` archive directly into a specified directory in one step?",
    "answer": "To extract a compressed `tar.gz` archive directly into a specified directory in one step, use commands like `tar -xvzf results.tar.gz -C new_results/` or `tar -C new_results/ -xzf results.tar.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a compressed `tar.bz2` archive directly into a specified directory in one step?",
    "answer": "To extract a compressed `tar.bz2` archive directly into a specified directory in one step, use commands like `tar -xvjf results.tar.bz2 -C new_results/` or `tar -C new_results/ -xvjf results.tar.bz2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the destination directory specified with the `-C` option does not exist when attempting to extract an archive?",
    "answer": "If the destination directory specified with the `-C` option does not exist, the `tar` command will fail because `tar` does not create the directory for you."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a `tar.gz` archive be extracted in two separate steps?",
    "answer": "A `tar.gz` archive can be extracted in two steps by first using `gunzip your_archive.tar.gz` to decompress it, and then using `tar -C destination_dir -xvf your_archive.tar` to un-tar the archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a `tar.bz2` archive be extracted in two separate steps?",
    "answer": "A `tar.bz2` archive can be extracted in two steps by first using `bunzip2 your_archive.tar.bz2` to decompress it, and then using `tar -C destination_dir -xvf your_archive.tar` to un-tar the archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `v` option mean when extracting files from an archive?",
    "answer": "The `v` option, standing for verbosity, displays the file names as they are extracted from the archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you get more detailed information, such as permissions and dates, when extracting an archive?",
    "answer": "To display more details like date and permissions during extraction, the `v` option should be invoked twice, such as using `tar -xvvf` or `tar -C new_results/ -xvvzf results.tar.gz`."
