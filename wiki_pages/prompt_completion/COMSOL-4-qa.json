    "question": "How do you connect to gra-vdi for interactive COMSOL use?",
    "answer": "Connect to gra-vdi with TigerVNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a time limit for interactive COMSOL sessions on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "There is no time limit when connecting to gra-vdi with TigerVNC."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step after connecting to gra-vdi when starting COMSOL?",
    "answer": "Open a terminal window in vncviewer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to start COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 (or newer) on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "First, load `CcEnv StdEnv/2023`, then `comsol/6.3`, and finally run `comsol -np 12 -Dosgi.locking=none`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6 (or older) on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Load `CcEnv StdEnv/2020`, then `comsol/5.6`, and then run `comsol -np 12 -Dosgi.locking=none`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which commands should be used to launch COMSOL Multiphysics 5.5 (or older) on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Load `CcEnv StdEnv/2016`, then `comsol/5.5`, and then run `comsol -np 12 -Dosgi.locking=none`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if COMSOL's upper menu items are greyed out in GUI mode?",
    "answer": "If COMSOL's upper menu items are greyed out, your `~/.comsol` may be corrupted. To fix it, rename or remove it by running `rm -rf ~/.comsol` and then restart COMSOL."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can cause COMSOL's GUI menu items to be greyed out on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "This may occur if you previously loaded a COMSOL module from the SnEnv on gra-vdi."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are parametric problems solved interactively in the COMSOL GUI?",
    "answer": "Parametric problems may be solved using the Batch Sweep approach when working interactively in the COMSOL GUI."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can multiple parameter sweeps be performed using the Batch Sweep approach?",
    "answer": "Yes, multiple parameter sweeps can be carried out using the Batch Sweep approach."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run a parameter sweep on a cluster?",
    "answer": "To run a parameter sweep on a cluster, a job must be submitted to the scheduler from the command line using `sbatch slurmscript`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the Cluster Sweep node in the graphical interface supported for submitting parametric simulations to the cluster queue?",
    "answer": "No, support for submitting parametric simulations to the cluster queue from the graphical interface using a Cluster Sweep node is not available at this time."
