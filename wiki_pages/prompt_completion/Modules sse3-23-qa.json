    "question": "What is Salmon (salmonbeta)?",
    "answer": "Salmon is a wicked-fast program designed to produce highly-accurate, transcript-level quantification estimates from RNA-seq data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the version of salmonbeta available?",
    "answer": "The available version for salmonbeta is 0.6.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Salmon achieve its speed and accuracy?",
    "answer": "Salmon achieves its speed and accuracy through innovations like quasi-mapping (fast-to-compute proxies for traditional read alignments) and massively-parallel stochastic collapsed variational inference."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Salmon process both raw sequencing reads and regular alignments?",
    "answer": "Yes, Salmon can make use of its quasi-mapping algorithm with raw sequencing reads, or it can be provided with regular alignments (e.g., an unsorted BAM file) to estimate transcript-level abundances."
