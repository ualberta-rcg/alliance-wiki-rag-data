    "question": "What is minia?",
    "answer": "minia is software that uses GATB, The Genome Analysis Toolbox with de-Bruijn graph."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the version of minia available?",
    "answer": "The available version for minia is 3.2.6."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of software is minia?",
    "answer": "minia is a 'bio' type software."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the homepage for minia?",
    "answer": "The homepage for minia is located at https://github.com/GATB/gatb-core."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is miniasm used for?",
    "answer": "Miniasm is a very fast OLC-based de novo assembler for noisy long reads. It takes all-vs-all read self-mappings (typically by minimap) as input and outputs an assembly graph in the GFA format."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary characteristic of miniasm's assembly process regarding error rates?",
    "answer": "Miniasm does not include a consensus step, so its per-base error rate is similar to the raw input reads."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the available versions of miniasm?",
    "answer": "The available version for miniasm is 0.3-20191007."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of software is miniasm classified as?",
    "answer": "Miniasm is classified as 'bio' software."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Minimac3?",
    "answer": "Minimac3 is an implementation of genotype imputation algorithms, designed to be lower memory and more computationally efficient than its predecessors, minimac and minimac2."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of Minimac3 is listed?",
    "answer": "The listed version of Minimac3 is 2.0.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the goal of Minimac3's design?",
    "answer": "Minimac3 is designed to handle very large reference panels in a more computationally efficient way without losing accuracy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Minimac3 a bioinformatics tool?",
    "answer": "Yes, Minimac3 is a 'bio' type software."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Minimac4?",
    "answer": "Minimac4 is the latest version in the series of genotype imputation software, succeeding Minimac3, Minimac2, minimac, and MaCH. It offers lower memory usage and improved computational efficiency with comparable imputation quality."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the version of Minimac4?",
    "answer": "The version available for Minimac4 is 1.0.2."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more information about Minimac4?",
    "answer": "You can find more information about Minimac4 on its homepage: https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac4."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of minimap2?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 is a fast sequence mapping and alignment program used to find overlaps between long noisy reads, or to map long reads or their assemblies to a reference genome, with optional detailed alignment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key performance characteristics of minimap2?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 works efficiently with query sequences from a few kilobases to ~100 megabases at an error rate of ~15% and is over 20 times faster than most other long-read aligners."
  },
  {
    "question": "What output formats does minimap2 support?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 outputs in the PAF or the SAM format."
  },
  {
    "question": "List the available versions for minimap2.",
    "answer": "Available versions for minimap2 include 2.17, 2.18, 2.24, 2.26, and 2.28."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is MinPath?",
    "answer": "MinPath (Minimal set of Pathways) is a parsimony approach designed for biological pathway reconstructions using protein family predictions, providing a more conservative and faithful estimation of pathways for a given query dataset."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of MinPath is available?",
    "answer": "The available version for MinPath is 1.6."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the homepage for MinPath?",
    "answer": "The homepage for MinPath is https://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/MinPath."
