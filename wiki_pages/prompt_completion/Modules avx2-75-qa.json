    "question": "What is Miniasm used for?",
    "answer": "Miniasm is a very fast OLC-based de novo assembler for noisy long reads."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of Miniasm is mentioned in the document?",
    "answer": "Miniasm is available in version 0.3-20191007."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Miniasm handle consensus sequences?",
    "answer": "Miniasm does not have a consensus step; it concatenates pieces of read sequences to generate the final unitig sequences, resulting in a per-base error rate similar to the raw input reads."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the input and output format for Miniasm?",
    "answer": "Miniasm takes all-vs-all read self-mappings (typically by minimap) as input and outputs an assembly graph in the GFA format."

    "answer": "More information about Miniasm can be found on its homepage at https://github.com/lh3/minimap2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What category does Miniasm fall under?",
    "answer": "Miniasm is a bio module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Minimac3?",
    "answer": "Minimac3 is a lower memory and more computationally efficient implementation of the genotype imputation algorithms in minimac and minimac2, designed to handle very large reference panels with no loss of accuracy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of Minimac3 is listed?",
    "answer": "Minimac3 is listed in version 2.0.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage for Minimac3?",
    "answer": "The homepage for Minimac3 is http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac3."

    "answer": "Minimac3 is a bio module."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Minimac4 and how does it compare to its predecessors?",
    "answer": "Minimac4 is the latest version in the genotype imputation software series (preceded by Minimac3, Minimac2, minimac, and MaCH), offering lower memory usage and more computational efficiency with comparable imputation quality."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the version of Minimac4?",
    "answer": "Minimac4 is available in version 1.0.2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the URL for the Minimac4 project?",
    "answer": "The URL for the Minimac4 project is https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac4."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Minimap2?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 is a fast sequence mapping and alignment program that can find overlaps between long noisy reads, or map long reads or their assemblies to a reference genome optionally with detailed alignment (i.e. CIGAR)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the available versions for Minimap2?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 is available in versions 2.17, 2.18, 2.24, 2.26, and 2.28."
  },
  {
    "question": "What formats does Minimap2 output?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 outputs in the PAF or the SAM format."
  },
  {
    "question": "How efficient is Minimap2 compared to other long-read aligners?",
    "answer": "On limited test data sets, Minimap2 is over 20 times faster than most other long-read aligners."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main purpose of Minimap2?",
    "answer": "Minimap2 is designed for fast sequence mapping and alignment, particularly for long noisy reads and will replace BWA-MEM for long reads and contig alignment."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the homepage for Minimap2?",
    "answer": "The homepage for Minimap2 is https://github.com/lh3/minimap2."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is MinPath?",
    "answer": "MinPath (Minimal set of Pathways) is a parsimony approach for biological pathway reconstructions using protein family predictions, aiming for a more conservative and faithful estimation of biological pathways for a query dataset."
