    "question": "What is MAFFT?",
    "answer": "MAFFT is a multiple sequence alignment program for unix-like operating systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What alignment methods does MAFFT offer?",
    "answer": "It offers a range of multiple alignment methods, L-INS-i (accurate; for alignment of <\u223c200 sequences), FFT-NS-2 (fast; for alignment of <\u223c30,000 sequences), etc."
  },
