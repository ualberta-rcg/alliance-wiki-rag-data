    "question": "What is RUNPATH in the context of binaries under `/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca`?",
    "answer": "RUNPATH refers to the directories for the runtime libraries that these binaries depend on, which are embedded directly inside the binary."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it necessary to use the `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable for binaries under `/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca`?",
    "answer": "No, it is generally not necessary to use `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` because the binaries under `/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca` use RUNPATH."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the potential consequences of setting `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for binaries that use RUNPATH?",
    "answer": "Setting `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` overrides the RUNPATH, and if set to locations such as `/usr/lib64` or `$EBROOTGENTOO/lib64`, many binaries may no longer work."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you remove the CVMFS environment if other methods fail?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `module --force purge` to remove the CVMFS environment, leaving a bare-bones CentOS-7 installation without modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what special situations might `module --force purge` be useful?",
    "answer": "It may be helpful for special situations such as compiling GCC yourself or using custom toolchains like the MESA SDK."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is `module --force purge` typically necessary?",
    "answer": "`module --force purge` is only necessary when compiling such specific software; the modules can be reloaded when running it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is code typically compiled?",
    "answer": "In most situations, you can compile code on the login nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should code be compiled on a compute node instead of a login node?",
    "answer": "If the code needs to be built on a node with specific hardware, such as a GPU or a Skylake CPU, you should start an interactive job on a host with the required hardware and compile from there."
