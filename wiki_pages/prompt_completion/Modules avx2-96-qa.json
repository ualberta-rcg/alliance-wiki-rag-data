    "answer": "Platanus is a PLATform for Assembling NUcleotide Sequences."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Platanus-allee differ from Platanus?",
    "answer": "Platanus-allee constructs each haplotype sequence from the beginning and pairs them as homologous chromosomes, while Platanus constructs a consensus sequence first and then splits it into haplotypes. Platanus-allee shows better performance for highly heterozygous species genomes or highly diverged genomic regions."
