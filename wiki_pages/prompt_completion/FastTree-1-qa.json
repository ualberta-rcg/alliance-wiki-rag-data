  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of FastTree?",
    "answer": "FastTree infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum number of sequences FastTree can handle in an alignment?",
    "answer": "FastTree can handle alignments with up to a million sequences."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of software modules are available for FastTree calculations?",
    "answer": "Software modules are offered for single precision and double precision calculations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference in performance and precision between single and double precision FastTree modules?",
    "answer": "Single precision is faster, while double precision is more precise."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances is it recommended to use a double precision FastTree module?",
    "answer": "Double precision is recommended when using a highly biased transition matrix or if you want to resolve very short branches accurately."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you view the available FastTree modules?",
    "answer": "You can see the available FastTree modules by executing the command `module spider fasttree`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to load a single precision FastTree module (version 2.1.11)?",
    "answer": "To load a single precision module, use the command `module load fasttree/2.1.11`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to load a double precision FastTree module (version 2.1.11)?",
    "answer": "To load a double precision module, use the command `module load fasttree-double/2.1.11`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the solution if FastTree displays the warning 'WARNING! This alignment consists of closely-related and very long sequences'?",
    "answer": "If you encounter this warning, which likely indicates very short or negative branch lengths, you should use a `fasttree-double` module for double precision."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find the FastTree Web page?",
    "answer": "The FastTree Web page is available at https://morgannprice.github.io/fasttree/."
