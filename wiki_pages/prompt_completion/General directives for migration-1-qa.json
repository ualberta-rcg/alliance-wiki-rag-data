  {
    "question": "What should I confirm before migrating my data?",
    "answer": "Confirm whether you or the staff are responsible for data migration."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should I contact if I am unsure about who is responsible for data migration?",
    "answer": "Contact technical support if you are in any doubt."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps should I take if I am new to using Globus for data migration?",
    "answer": "Read about Globus and verify that it works on the system you are migrating from."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to test tools like tar, gzip, or zip before using them for migration?",
    "answer": "Testing ensures you know how they work before using them on important data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What general advice is given about when to start a data migration?",
    "answer": "Do not wait until the last minute to start your migration."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long should I expect large data transfers to take?",
    "answer": "Expect hundreds of gigabytes to take hours and terabytes to take days, allowing extra time for potential problems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is cleaning up files and directories beneficial before a major data migration?",
    "answer": "Cleaning up saves transfer time, and storage space even on new systems is in great demand and should not be wasted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can intermediate files from compiled programs be deleted during cleanup?",
    "answer": "Use commands like `make clean`, `make realclean`, or `rm *.o`, depending on your makefile."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are large files named like `core.12345`, and can they be removed?",
    "answer": "They are probably core dumps and can be deleted if you don't know what they are."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it more efficient to archive directories with many small files before transfer?",
    "answer": "File transfer programs move one reasonable-sized file more efficiently than thousands of small files of equal total size."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which tool is recommended for archiving many small files into one?",
    "answer": "Use `tar` to combine (archive) them."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what cases can large files benefit from compression for transfer?",
    "answer": "Large files, especially text files, can benefit from compression in some cases."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors determine if compressing a file saves overall transfer time?",
    "answer": "It depends on how much the file can be compressed, how long it takes to compress, and the transfer bandwidth."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tools can be used for compression if it's considered worthwhile?",
    "answer": "`tar` or `gzip` can be used for compression."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should one handle data that is duplicated across multiple source systems during migration?",
    "answer": "Choose one source and move the duplicate data only from that one to avoid moving the same data twice."
  },
  {
    "question": "What precaution should be taken regarding files with duplicate names that may contain different information?",
    "answer": "Ensure that you will not accidentally overwrite one file with another of the same name."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the most user-friendly and efficient tool recommended for file transfer if supported at the source site?",
    "answer": "Globus is recommended because it is user-friendly, efficient, and designed to recover from network interruptions automatically."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific setting is recommended to enable in Globus's Transfer & Timer Options?",
    "answer": "Enable the setting to \"preserve source file modification times\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "What practices become even more important if Globus is not supported at the source site?",
    "answer": "Compressing data and avoiding duplication become even more important."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which tools are mentioned as alternatives if Globus is not supported for file transfer?",
    "answer": "`scp`, `sftp`, or `rsync` are mentioned as alternatives."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a recommended migration strategy when using tools like scp, sftp, or rsync?",
    "answer": "Make a schedule to migrate your data in blocks of a few hundreds of GBs at a time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the advantage of migrating data in blocks when using tools like scp, sftp, or rsync?",
    "answer": "If the transfer stops, you can try again starting from the incomplete file without re-transferring already complete files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one monitor the progress of transfers done with tools like scp, sftp, or rsync?",
    "answer": "Check regularly to see that the transfer process has not stopped, using file size as a good indicator of progress."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do if a transfer using scp, sftp, or rsync seems to have stopped?",
    "answer": "If no files have changed size for several minutes and restarting the transfer does not work, contact technical support."
