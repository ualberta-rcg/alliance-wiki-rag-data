    "question": "What is GenMap?",
    "answer": "GenMap is a tool for fast and exact computation of genome mappability."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does GenMap compute genome mappability?",
    "answer": "GenMap computes genome mappability by determining the uniqueness of k-mers for each position in the genome, allowing for up to 'e' mismatches, and describes this as the reciprocal value of how often each k-mer occurs approximately in the genome."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a mappability value of 1 indicate in GenMap?",
    "answer": "A mappability value of 1 at a specific position in GenMap indicates that the k-mer in the sequence at that position occurs only once in the genome with up to 'e' errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the applications of GenMap?",
    "answer": "GenMap can be applied to single or multiple genomes to identify regions that are unique or shared by many or all genomes."
