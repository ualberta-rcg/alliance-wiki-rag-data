  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of genewise?",
    "answer": "genewise is a package focused on comparisons of biopolymers, particularly DNA and protein sequences. Its most used algorithm, 'genewise', compares DNA sequence at the level of its protein translation to simultaneously predict gene structure with homology-based alignment."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which version of genewise is mentioned?",
    "answer": "Version 2.4.1 of genewise is mentioned."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Gengetopt and its main function?",
    "answer": "Gengetopt is a tool designed to write command-line option parsing code for C programs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the version of Gengetopt available?",
    "answer": "Gengetopt version 2.23 is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does GenMap compute?",
    "answer": "GenMap computes the uniqueness of k-mers for each position in the genome, also known as (k,e)-mappability. This indicates how often each k-mer occurs approximately in the genome with up to 'e' mismatches."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can GenMap be used for multiple genomes?",
    "answer": "Yes, GenMap can be applied to single or multiple genomes to find regions that are unique or shared."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage URL for the Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM)?",
    "answer": "The homepage URL for the Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM) is https://github.com/ECCC-ASTD-MRD/gem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the type of the GEMMA software?",
    "answer": "The GEMMA software is of type 'bio'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the homepage for the Gengetopt tool?",
    "answer": "The homepage for the Gengetopt tool is https://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html."
