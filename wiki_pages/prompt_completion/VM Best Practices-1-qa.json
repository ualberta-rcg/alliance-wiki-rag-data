    "question": "What is the purpose of this page regarding Compute Canada's cloud instances?",
    "answer": "This page provides guidance based on user experiences with Compute Canada's cloud instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is updating packages a recommended operation for cloud instances?",
    "answer": "Updating packages is often a safe operation and is recommended for security reasons."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is upgrading to a major new operating system version a good security measure?",
    "answer": "Upgrading from one major version of an operating system to the next is a good security measure, however, it can often cause problems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What precautionary step should be taken before performing a major operating system upgrade on a VM?",
    "answer": "Before performing any major operating system upgrades, create a backup of your VM so you can recover if the process fails."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should a second volume for data be considered for VMs with unbounded storage requirements?",
    "answer": "It is very difficult to expand a root volume, so for VMs with unbounded storage requirements, consider creating a second volume for data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a data volume be expanded if more space is needed?",
    "answer": "If more space is needed, you can expand the data volume using OpenStack and then expand the logical volume and filesystem within your VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many volumes should you avoid attaching to a VM?",
    "answer": "Avoid attaching more than three volumes to a VM."
  },
  {
    "question": "What problems can arise from attaching more than three volumes to a VM?",
    "answer": "Attaching more than three volumes to a VM has been observed to lead to kernel timeouts, affect disk operations, cause cascading effects, and can render the VM effectively inoperative."
  },
  {
    "question": "If using a data volume, how many should be attached to a VM?",
    "answer": "If using a data volume, use only one, and you can carve it up into multiple filesystems inside your VM and expand it as necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where has the issue of multiple volumes causing kernel timeouts been observed?",
    "answer": "This issue has been observed on Arbutus (arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca) by multiple users."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example of the issue with multiple volumes on Arbutus?",
    "answer": "In one case on Arbutus, 3 x 100GB volumes attached to a p4-6gb VM caused kernel timeouts whenever disk operations of any magnitude were attempted, making it very difficult to copy more than 500MB of data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Was the multiple volume issue observed on the East cloud?",
    "answer": "No, a test of a similar situation on East cloud with 4 x 100GB data volumes (along with the root volume) did not show the issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was a difference in the East cloud VM where the multiple volume issue did not occur?",
    "answer": "The East cloud VM had more memory (15 GB instead of 6 GB) than the Arbutus VM where the issue was observed, though high memory usage was not believed to be a factor."
