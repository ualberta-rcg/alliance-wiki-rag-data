  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the Fluent requeue Slurm scripts?",
    "answer": "The Fluent requeue Slurm scripts are designed to automate the resubmission of jobs that frequently fail to start due to license shortages, allowing for multiple attempts to checkout licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are the Fluent requeue scripts recommended?",
    "answer": "They are recommended for Fluent jobs that are known to complete normally without errors but typically require multiple requeue attempts to checkout licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should the Fluent requeue scripts be avoided?",
    "answer": "These scripts are not recommended for Fluent jobs that might run for a long time before crashing or run to completion but contain unresolved journal file warnings, as such simulations will be repeated from the beginning for each requeue attempt."
  },
  {
    "question": "What action should be taken if a job using a requeue script is determined to be failing due to a simulation issue rather than a license issue?",
    "answer": "If a job is requeued due to a simulation issue, it is strongly recommended to immediately manually kill the job progression using `scancel jobid` and then correct the underlying problem."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify the number of requeue attempts in a Fluent Slurm script?",
    "answer": "The number of requeue attempts is specified using the `#SBATCH --array=1-5%1` directive, where '5' indicates the number of attempts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the solution restart scripts for Fluent jobs?",
    "answer": "Solution restart scripts are provided to automate restarting very large Fluent jobs that require more than the typical seven-day maximum runtime window available on most clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a fundamental requirement for using solution restart scripts?",
    "answer": "A fundamental requirement is that the first time step must be able to complete within the requested job array time limit when starting a simulation from an initialized solution field."
  },
  {
    "question": "What files must be present to begin using solution restart scripts?",
    "answer": "To begin, a working set of `sample.cas`, `sample.dat`, and `sample.jou` files must be present."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the `sample.jou` file be modified for solution restarts?",
    "answer": "The `sample.jou` file should be edited to include `/solve/dual-time-iterate 1` and `/file/auto-save/data-frequency 1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should a restart journal file (`sample-restart.jou`) be created and modified?",
    "answer": "A restart journal file is created by copying `sample.jou` to `sample-restart.jou`. Then, `sample-restart.jou` should be edited to contain `/file/read-cas-data sample-restart` instead of `/file/read-cas-data sample`, and the initialization line (e.g., `;/solve/initialize/initialize-flow`) should be commented out with a semicolon."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can `sample-restart.jou` be configured to run faster for subsequent time steps if they are known to run twice as fast as the initial step?",
    "answer": "Edit `sample-restart.jou` to specify `/solve/dual-time-iterate 2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the total simulation time calculated when using solution restart scripts?",
    "answer": "The total simulation time will be `1*Dt + 2*Nrestart*Dt`, where `Dt` is the time step size and `Nrestart` is the number of solution restarts specified in the script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many output files will be generated with solution restart scripts if `/solve/dual-time-iterate 2` is chosen for subsequent steps?",
    "answer": "The total number of time steps (and hence output files) generated will be `1 + 2*Nrestart`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum Slurm time window that can be requested for solution restart jobs?",
    "answer": "The maximum Slurm time window is \"#SBATCH --time=07-00:00\" days."
