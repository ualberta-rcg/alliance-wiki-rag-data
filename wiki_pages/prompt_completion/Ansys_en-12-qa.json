    "question": "How do you enable DPM coupled calculations in an Ansys Fluent journal file?",
    "answer": "To enable DPM coupled calculations, add the command `/define/models/dpm/interaction/coupled-calculations yes` to your journal file after solution initialization."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you delete and create DPM injections using an Ansys Fluent journal file?",
    "answer": "You can delete an injection with `/define/models/dpm/injections/delete-injection injection-0:1` and create a new one from a file using `/define/models/dpm/injections/create injection-0:1 no yes file no zinjection01.inj no no no no`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the format for a basic steady DPM injection text file in Ansys Fluent?",
    "answer": "A basic steady DPM injection file like `zinjection01.inj` would contain lines such as `(z=4 12)` and `( x y z u v w diameter t mass-flow mass frequency time name )` followed by the particle properties, e.g., `(( 2.90e-02 5.00e-03 0.0 -1.00e-03 0.0 0.0 1.00e-04 2.93e+02 1.00e-06 0.0 0.0 0.0 ) injection-0:1 )`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find detailed documentation on DPM injection file formats for Ansys Fluent?",
    "answer": "The format for steady DPM injection files is described in subsection `Part III: Solution Mode | Chapter 24: Modeling Discrete Phase | 24.3. Setting Initial Conditions for the Discrete Phase | 24.3.13 Point Properties for File Injections | 24.3.13.1 Steady File Format` of the `2024R2 Fluent Customization Manual`."

  {
    "question": "How do I view the command-line options for Ansys CFX's `cfx5solve`?",
    "answer": "You can view the command-line options by first loading the correct Ansys module and then running `cfx5solve -help`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I run Ansys CFX's `cfx5solve` in double precision?",
    "answer": "To run `cfx5solve` in double precision, add the `-double` option to your command. Note that this will also double memory requirements."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default mesh element limits for `cfx5solve`?",
    "answer": "`cfx5solve` can support meshes with up to 80 million structured elements or 200 million unstructured elements by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I configure `cfx5solve` to handle meshes larger than the default limits?",
    "answer": "For larger meshes, specifically up to 2 billion elements, you should add the `-large` option to the `cfx5solve` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a typical Slurm script configuration for a single-node Ansys CFX job?",
    "answer": "A typical script uses `#SBATCH --account=def-group`, `#SBATCH --time=00-03:00`, `#SBATCH --nodes=1`, `#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4` (or other core count), `#SBATCH --mem=16G`, and `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1`, along with loading `StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2023R2` modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start a single-node Ansys CFX job using `cfx5solve` on a Narval cluster compared to other clusters?",
    "answer": "On Narval, use `cfx5solve -def YOURFILE.def -start-method \"Open MPI Local Parallel\" -part $SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE`. On other clusters, use `cfx5solve -def YOURFILE.def -start-method \"Intel MPI Local Parallel\" -part $SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key Slurm parameters for a multinode Ansys CFX job?",
    "answer": "Key Slurm parameters include `#SBATCH --account=def-group`, `#SBATCH --time=00-03:00`, `#SBATCH --nodes=2` (or more), `#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=64` (or other core count), `#SBATCH --mem=0`, and `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1`, combined with loading the `StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2023R2` modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the `cfx5solve` command for a multinode Ansys CFX job on Narval versus other clusters?",
    "answer": "On Narval, use `cfx5solve -def YOURFILE.def -start-method \"Open MPI Distributed Parallel\" -par-dist $NNODES`. On other clusters, set `export I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP=ssh` and `unset I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP_EXEC_EXTRA_ARGS`, then use `cfx5solve -def YOURFILE.def -start-method \"Intel MPI Distributed Parallel\" -par-dist $NNODES`."
