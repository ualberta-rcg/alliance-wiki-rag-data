    "question": "What journal commands can be used to manage DPM injections and interaction with the continuous phase in Ansys Fluent?",
    "answer": "You can use `/define/models/dpm/interaction/coupled-calculations yes` to enable interaction with the continuous phase, and for managing injections, use `/define/models/dpm/injections/delete-injection injection-0:1` to delete, and `/define/models/dpm/injections/create injection-0:1 no yes file no zinjection01.inj no no no no` to create."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I list the particles and properties of a DPM injection in Ansys Fluent using journal commands?",
    "answer": "To list the particles of an injection, use `/define/models/dpm/injections/list-particles injection-0:1`, and to list its properties, use `/define/models/dpm/injections/list-injection-properties injection-0:1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find details on the steady file format for DPM injection files?",
    "answer": "The steady file format for DPM injection files is described in `Part III: Solution Mode | Chapter 24: Modeling Discrete Phase | 24.3. Setting Initial Conditions for the Discrete Phase | 24.3.13 Point Properties for File Injections | 24.3.13.1 Steady File Format` of the `2024R2 Fluent Customization Manual`."

  {
    "question": "How do I get a summary of command-line options for cfx5solve?",
    "answer": "You can print a summary of command-line options by running `cfx5solve -help` after manually loading the appropriate module version in your Slurm script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default precision setting for cfx5solve, and how can I change it to double precision?",
    "answer": "By default, `cfx5solve` runs in single precision (`-single`). To run it in double precision, add the `-double` option to the command line."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the memory implications of running cfx5solve in double precision?",
    "answer": "Running `cfx5solve` in double precision will double the memory requirements."
  },
  {
    "question": "What mesh sizes can cfx5solve typically handle, and how can it support larger meshes?",
    "answer": "By default, `cfx5solve` can support meshes with up to 80 million structured elements or 200 million unstructured elements. For larger meshes, up to 2 billion elements, you need to add the `-large` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more detailed information about specifying options for the Partitioner, Interpolator, or Solver in Ansys CFX?",
    "answer": "You should consult the `ANSYS CFX-Solver Manager User's Guide` for further details on specifying various combinations of options for the Partitioner, Interpolator, or Solver."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Slurm script settings are required for a single-node Ansys CFX job on Narval?",
    "answer": "For a single-node Ansys CFX job on Narval, the Slurm script should specify `--nodes=1`, and `cfx5solve` should be run with `-start-method \"Open MPI Local Parallel\" -part $SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run a multinode Ansys CFX job using Intel MPI?",
    "answer": "For multinode jobs using Intel MPI, you need to include `export I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP=ssh` and `unset I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP_EXEC_EXTRA_ARGS` in your script, and then run `cfx5solve -def YOURFILE.def -start-method \"Intel MPI Distributed Parallel\" -par-dist $NNODES`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which module versions are recommended for Ansys CFX Slurm scripts using StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "For Slurm scripts using `StdEnv/2023`, it is recommended to load `ansys/2023R2` or newer module versions for Ansys CFX."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the maximum cores per node recommended for Ansys CFX single-node jobs on Graham, Cedar, Beluga, and Narval?",
    "answer": "For single-node Ansys CFX jobs, the maximum recommended cores per node are 44 for Graham, 32 or 48 for Cedar, 40 for Beluga, and 64 for Narval."
