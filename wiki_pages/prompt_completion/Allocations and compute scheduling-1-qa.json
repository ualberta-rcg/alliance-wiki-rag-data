    "question": "What is an allocation in high-performance computing?",
    "answer": "An allocation is an amount of resources that a research group can target for use for a period of time, usually a year."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical duration for an allocation?",
    "answer": "Allocations are usually granted for a period of time, typically a year."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are resources allocated for storage versus shared resources like computation cores?",
    "answer": "For storage, an allocation is a maximum amount, while for shared resources like computation cores, it's an average amount of usage over the period."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what terms are allocations usually made?",
    "answer": "Allocations are usually made in terms of core years, GPU years, or storage space."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference in understanding between storage allocations and core/GPU year allocations?",
    "answer": "Storage allocations are straightforward, providing a maximum amount for exclusive use. Core year and GPU year allocations are more complex as they represent an average use over time on shared resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does a research group get extra resource usage if clusters are down for maintenance during their allocation period?",
    "answer": "No, the allocation period is a reference value; if clusters are down for maintenance, a research group is not entitled to additional resource usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to a research group's resource access if the allocation period is extended?",
    "answer": "If the allocation period is extended, research groups affected would not see their resource access diminish during this additional time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a research group best achieve its core year and GPU year allocation targets?",
    "answer": "A research group is more likely to hit or exceed its core year and GPU year targets if resources are used evenly over the allocation period, rather than in bursts or delayed until later."
  },
  {
    "question": "What must research groups do to use compute-related resources from their core-year and GPU-year allocations?",
    "answer": "Research groups must submit what are referred to as jobs to a scheduler to use compute-related resources granted by core-year and GPU-year allocations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a 'job' in the context of compute allocations?",
    "answer": "A job is a combination of a computer program (an application) and a list of resources that the application is expected to use."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of a scheduler in high-performance computing?",
    "answer": "A scheduler is a program that calculates the priority of each job submitted and provides the needed resources based on the priority of each job and the available resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the scheduler determine job priority to meet allocation targets?",
    "answer": "The scheduler uses prioritization algorithms based on a research group\u2019s recent usage of the system as compared to their allocated usage, with the most weight put on recent usage (or non-usage)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the goal of the scheduler's prioritization approach?",
    "answer": "The goal is to allow a research group that matches their actual usage with their allocated amounts to operate roughly continuously at that level, smoothing resource usage over time across all groups and resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a research group runs more jobs than its target level when competing demand is low?",
    "answer": "If competing demand is low, the scheduler may allow more of your jobs to run than your target level, but succeeding jobs of yours may have lower priority for a time while other groups are prioritized."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are users prevented from submitting new jobs if they overuse their CPU or GPU allocation?",
    "answer": "No, users are not prevented from submitting or running new jobs, and the average usage over time should still be close to the allocation target."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible for a research group to exceed its allocation at the end of a period?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible that a research group could end a month or even a year having run more work than their allocation would seem to allow, though this is unlikely given resource demand."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an RGU and why was it introduced?",
    "answer": "An RGU, or Reference GPU Unit, was introduced in the 2024 RAC year to rank all GPU models in production and alleviate problems caused by treating all GPUs as equivalent for allocation purposes."
  },
  {
    "question": "When was the Reference GPU Unit (RGU) introduced?",
    "answer": "The Reference GPU Unit (RGU) was introduced in the 2024 RAC year."
  },
  {
    "question": "What new complexity did the 2025 RAC year introduce regarding GPUs?",
    "answer": "Since the 2025 RAC year, new complexity involving Multi-Instance GPU technology has to be dealt with."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the primary factors considered for evaluating and ranking different GPU models using RGUs?",
    "answer": "The primary factors are single-precision floating-point operations (FP32), half-precision floating-point operations (FP16), and the amount of memory on the GPU."
