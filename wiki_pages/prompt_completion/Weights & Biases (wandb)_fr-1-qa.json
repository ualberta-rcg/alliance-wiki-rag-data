    "question": "What is Weights & Biases (wandb)?",
    "answer": "Weights & Biases (wandb) is a machine meta-learning platform used for building models for concrete applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What functionalities does the Weights & Biases platform offer?",
    "answer": "The platform allows users to track, compare, describe, and reproduce machine learning experiments."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does wandb's availability vary across Alliance clusters?",
    "answer": "Wandb requires an internet connection, so its availability on compute nodes depends on the specific cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which clusters is wandb availability limited and requires `httpproxy`?",
    "answer": "Wandb availability is limited on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA, and is available only for members of MILA and other eligible groups via `httpproxy`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Alliance clusters provide full wandb availability without needing `httpproxy`?",
    "answer": "Cedar and Vulcan offer full wandb availability, and `httpproxy` is not required on these clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is wandb available on the Graham cluster, and if not, why?",
    "answer": "No, wandb is not available on the Graham cluster because internet access is deactivated on its compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can use `wandb` on Alliance clusters with internet access?",
    "answer": "Members of the MILA Qu\u00e9bec AI Institute and other groups with specific arrangements may use `wandb` on clusters with internet access."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of account do MILA members need to use `wandb`?",
    "answer": "MILA members must use a valid 'Mila-org' Weights & Biases account to log into `wandb`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary issue encountered when using wandb on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA?",
    "answer": "The `wandb` package automatically uploads environment information to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, which causes a crash during or at the end of training, and this behavior cannot currently be disabled."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to upload artifacts using `wandb.save()` on B\u00e9luga compute nodes?",
    "answer": "No, uploading artifacts with `wandb.save()` requires access to Google Cloud Storage, which is not available on B\u00e9luga compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users still use wandb on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA despite Google Cloud Storage limitations?",
    "answer": "Users can activate `wandb` in `offline` or `dryrun` modes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when wandb is used in `offline` or `dryrun` modes?",
    "answer": "In `offline` or `dryrun` modes, wandb writes all metrics, logs, and artifacts to the local disk without synchronizing with the Weights & Biases internet service."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can data collected in offline wandb modes be synchronized with the Weights & Biases server?",
    "answer": "Once tasks are completed, the data can be synchronized using the `wandb sync` command on the login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there an alternative to Weights & Biases that works on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA?",
    "answer": "Yes, Comet.ml is very similar to Weights & Biases and functions on B\u00e9luga, Narval, and TamIA."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step in preparing the environment for wandb in the example script `wandb-test.sh`?",
    "answer": "The first step is to load the `python` module."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a virtual environment created and activated for wandb in the provided example?",
    "answer": "A virtual environment is created with `virtualenv --no-download $SLURM_TMPDIR/env` and then activated with `source $SLURM_TMPDIR/env/bin/activate`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the `wandb` package installed within the virtual environment in the example script?",
    "answer": "The `wandb` package is installed using `pip install --no-index wandb`."
