    "question": "What is HMMER used for?",
    "answer": "HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for homologs of protein sequences and for making protein sequence alignments. It employs probabilistic models called profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What version of HMMER is available?",
    "answer": "HMMER version 3.3.2 is available."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does HMMER compare to BLAST and FASTA in terms of accuracy and speed?",
    "answer": "HMMER aims to be significantly more accurate and better at detecting remote homologs compared to BLAST and FASTA, due to its mathematical models. With the HMMER3 project, it is now essentially as fast as BLAST."
