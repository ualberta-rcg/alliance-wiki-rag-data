  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of HMMER?",
    "answer": "HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for homologs of protein sequences and for making protein sequence alignments. It employs probabilistic models called profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of HMMER are available?",
    "answer": "HMMER is available in version 3.3.2."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does HMMER compare to BLAST and FASTA in terms of accuracy and speed?",
    "answer": "HMMER aims to be significantly more accurate and more able to detect remote homologs than BLAST and FASTA due to its mathematical models. In its HMMER3 project, it is now essentially as fast as BLAST."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is HOOMD-blue?",
    "answer": "HOOMD-blue is a general-purpose particle simulation toolkit that can be used on both GPUs and CPUs, featuring a Python interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Python versions are compatible with HOOMD-blue?",
    "answer": "HOOMD-blue is compatible with Python versions 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of htslib?",
    "answer": "htslib is a C library designed for reading and writing high-throughput sequencing data. It also includes utilities such as bgzip and tabix."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of htslib are listed?",
    "answer": "The listed versions for htslib are 1.10.2, 1.13, and 1.14."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package used for?",
    "answer": "hwloc provides a portable abstraction of the hierarchical topology of modern computer architectures, including NUMA memory nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores, and simultaneous multithreading. It helps applications gather system attributes to exploit hardware efficiently."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of hwloc are available?",
    "answer": "hwloc is available in versions 2.4.0 and 2.7.1."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is IgBLAST and what does it analyze?",
    "answer": "IgBLAST is a software tool developed at NCBI that facilitates the analysis of immunoglobulin variable domain sequences and has been extended to perform analysis for T cell receptor (TR) sequences. It utilizes the BLAST search algorithm."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of IgBLAST are listed?",
    "answer": "IgBLAST is available in versions 1.17.0 and 1.18.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find more information about HMMER?",
    "answer": "More information about HMMER can be found on its homepage: http://hmmer.org/."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary goal of the HMMER3 project?",
    "answer": "The primary goal of the HMMER3 project was to achieve computational speed comparable to BLAST, while retaining HMMER's superior accuracy for detecting remote homologs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does HOOMD-blue support MPI?",
    "answer": "Yes, there is a `hoomd-blue-mpi` module listed, indicating MPI support for the general-purpose particle simulation toolkit."
