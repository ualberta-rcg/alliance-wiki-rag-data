    "question": "What is the primary function of `mpirun`?",
    "answer": "`mpirun` is a wrapper that enables communication between processes running on different machines."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it often unnecessary to specify node lists or process counts to `mpirun` with modern schedulers?",
    "answer": "Modern schedulers, like Torque/Moab and Slurm, automatically provide many things `mpirun` needs, such as the list of nodes on which to run, the number of processes to launch, and task affinity."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does `srun` handle process distribution for an application?",
    "answer": "`srun application.exe` automatically distributes the processes to precisely the resources allocated to the job."
  },
  {
    "question": "In programming terms, how does `srun` compare to `mpirun`?",
    "answer": "`srun` is at a higher level of abstraction than `mpirun`, capable of everything `mpirun` can do and more."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is `srun` described within the Slurm ecosystem?",
    "answer": "`srun` is the SLURM all-around parallel-tasks distributor, used to distribute any kind of computation (MPI, OpenMP, hybrid, serial farming, etc.) once resources are allocated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when an application is executed using `srun` in Slurm?",
    "answer": "When `srun` an application, a job step is started, the environment variables `SLURM_STEP_ID` and `SLURM_PROCID` are initialized, and correct accounting information is recorded."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can `mpiexec` offer better performance than `srun`?",
    "answer": "Better performance might be achievable with `mpiexec` than with `srun` under certain circumstances."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an advantage of using `srun` over `mpiexec` in terms of resource management?",
    "answer": "Using `srun` minimizes the risk of a mismatch between the resources allocated by Slurm and those used by Open MPI."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find documentation for `sbatch` and `srun`?",
    "answer": "Documentation for `sbatch` and `srun` is available on the slurm.schedmd.com website."
