    "question": "According to the compiler output for `allocate_3d_poisson_matrix` inlined in `main` at line 43, why was a loop not fused?",
    "answer": "The loop was not fused due to a 'different loop trip count'."

  {
    "question": "What idiom caused the loop in `initialize_vector` to be replaced when inlined in `main` at line 36?",

  {
    "question": "What was the compiler's observation about loop fusion in `allocate_3d_poisson_matrix` at line 57 when inlined in `main`?",
