    "question": "What is OpenCV?",
    "answer": "OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is OpenCV available with CUDA support?",
    "answer": "Yes, OpenCV is also available with CUDA."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the OpenCV module with CUDA?",
    "answer": "You can load the OpenCV module with CUDA by using the command `module load gcc cuda opencv/X.Y.Z`, where X.Y.Z represents the desired version."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the OpenCV module include extra modules?",
    "answer": "Yes, the module also contains the extra modules, known as `contrib` modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you discover compatible Python versions for OpenCV bindings?",
    "answer": "To discover compatible Python versions, you can run `module spider opencv/X.Y.Z` or `module spider opencv_python/X.Y.Z`, replacing X.Y.Z with the desired version."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules need to be loaded to use OpenCV with Python?",
    "answer": "You need to load `gcc`, `opencv/X.Y.Z` (with the desired version), `python`, and `scipy-stack`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you verify if the OpenCV import was successful in Python?",
    "answer": "After running `python -c \"import cv2\"`, if the command displays nothing, the import was successful."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the four different Python packages provided by OpenCV?",
    "answer": "OpenCV provides four different packages: `opencv_python`, `opencv_contrib_python`, `opencv_python_headless`, and `opencv_contrib_python_headless`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does loading the `opencv` module help with Python package dependencies?",
    "answer": "With the `opencv` module loaded, the package dependency for one of the named OpenCV Python packages will be satisfied."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you enable OpenCV to read EXR files?",
    "answer": "To read EXR files with OpenCV, the module must be activated through an environment variable using the command `OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR=1 python <file>`."
