    "question": "What must be created from your laptop to the compute node after starting a VNC server?",
    "answer": "A secure \"bridge\" or \"tunnel\" from your laptop to the compute node where your vncserver is running."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many types of SSH tunnel commands are available for connecting to a VNC server?",
    "answer": "There are two types of tunnel commands that may be used, depending on the cluster."

  {
    "question": "What is the recommended SSH tunnel command format for clusters other than nibi?",
    "answer": "The command format is `ssh username@clustername -L localforwardedport:computnode:remotelisteningport`."

  {
    "question": "What is the specific SSH tunnel command format for the `nibi` cluster?",

  {
    "question": "What additional setup is required on your laptop to use the `nibi` cluster's SSH tunnel approach?",
    "answer": "An SSH key pair must be created on your laptop, with the contents of the public key entered into your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on `nibi`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the SSH tunnel command approach used for `nibi` also be applied to other clusters?",
    "answer": "Yes, this approach will also work on any other cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Give an example SSH tunnel command for the `nibi` cluster if the compute node is `c48`, the local port is 5905, and the remote port is 5901.",
    "answer": "`ssh -J username@nibi.alliancecan.ca -L 5905:localhost:5901 c48`"
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if you exit the node your SSH tunnel is connected to?",
    "answer": "If you exit the node that your tunnel is connected to, you will no longer be able to connect to the VNC server with `vncviewer`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you regain access to a running VNC server if you've exited the node and lost the tunnel connection?",
    "answer": "You may regain access by simply starting a new tunnel."

  {
    "question": "How do users with a Linux desktop connect to the VNC server after setting up an SSH tunnel?",
    "answer": "Open a new local terminal window and tell your VNC client to connect to `localhost:port` using the `vncviewer` command, for example, `vncviewer localhost:5905`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to connect to the VNC server using `vncviewer`?",
    "answer": "You will be prompted for the VNC password that you set up earlier."
  },
  {

    "answer": "They may click the `TigerVNC Viewer` application icon and enter their `localhost:port` information."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default VNC port assumed by TigerVNC Viewer?",
    "answer": "The default VNC port assumed by TigerVNC Viewer is 5900."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can you simply specify 'localhost' in TigerVNC Viewer instead of 'localhost:port'?",
    "answer": "If you specified 5900 as the local port to be forwarded when you started your SSH tunnel, then you could simply specify 'localhost'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any limitations for Windows users when setting up SSH tunnels on local port 5900?",
    "answer": "Windows users may find they cannot set up an SSH tunnel on local port 5900 in the first place."
