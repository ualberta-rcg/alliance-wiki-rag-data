    "question": "What should I do if I experience repeated failures to establish a new VNC connection?",
    "answer": "Repeated failing attempts to establish a new vncserver/vncviewer connection may be due to an old SSH tunnel still running on your desktop tying up ports. To identify and kill any such tunnels, open a terminal window on your desktop and run `ps ux | grep ssh` followed by `kill PID`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which password should I use if my VNC screensaver times out and requests a password?",
    "answer": "If your VNC screensaver times out and requests a password, enter your cluster account password to unlock it (not your vncserver password)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can I use if the MATE desktop screensaver will not unlock?",
    "answer": "If you are running the MATE desktop and the screensaver will not unlock, try running `killall -9 .mate-screensaver`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Has the VNC screensaver issue been resolved on clusters?",
    "answer": "This should no longer be a problem on our clusters as the VNC screensaver has been disabled."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the two-step login procedure for gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca.",
    "answer": "The procedure to login to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca is a two-step process: 1) enter your username and ccdb password, and 2) enter your username and Duo two-factor MFA passcode."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if I enter the wrong username/password in the first step of logging into gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca?",
    "answer": "If you enter the wrong username/password for the first step, you will still be prompted by the second step. If you then send your username/passcode, you will receive a message that says 'Success, Logging you in...' and be returned to the login screen of the first step."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I reset my Alliance ccdb password?",
    "answer": "If you cannot recall your Alliance ccdb password, visit `https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/security/forgot` to reset it, assuming your account is not pending renewal by your PI."

  {
    "question": "What changes are required to run a graphics program that utilizes hardware-based accelerated OpenGL?",
    "answer": "To run a graphics based program that utilizes hardware-based accelerated OpenGL, the `salloc` command must be modified to request a GPU node, and `vglrun` will probably need to be added just before the name of your `PROGRAM` on the command line of your VNC desktop terminal window."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I request a GPU node using the `salloc` command to run OpenGL graphics programs?",
    "answer": "To request the first GPU node that comes available, specify `salloc --time=1:00:00 --cpus-per-task=4 --gpus-per-node=1 --mem=16000 --account=def-piname`. If a specific GPU type like 't4' is desired, use `salloc --time=1:00:00 --cpus-per-task=4 --gpus-per-node=t4:1 --mem=16000 --account=def-piname`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to request a GPU node for OpenGL graphics programs?",
    "answer": "If a GPU node is not requested, the program will fall back to using software-based rendering on CPUs, which is relatively much slower than hardware-accelerated OpenGL."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `vglrun` command when running an OpenGL program?",
    "answer": "`vglrun` sets some extra environment variables to ensure your program will use correct VirtualGL libraries."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the `vglrun` command not required for an OpenGL program?",
    "answer": "`vglrun` is not required if your `PROGRAM` has already been patched to use the current cvmfs standard environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some alternative solutions if I experience graphics issues when using VNC?",
    "answer": "If you experience graphics issues when using VNC, you can try using OpenOnDemand on the nibi cluster (`https://ondemand.sharcnet.ca/`) or JupyterHub on the rorqual cluster (`https://jupyterhub.rorqual.alliancecan.ca/`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What benefits do OpenOnDemand and JupyterHub offer as alternatives to VNC for graphics?",
    "answer": "Both OpenOnDemand and JupyterHub offer an automated modern desktop VDI web interface GUI experience that is designed for ease of use with improved hardware performance and software support."
