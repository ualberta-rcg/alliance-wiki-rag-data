  {
    "question": "How can you verify that you are performing parallel rendering in ParaView?",
    "answer": "You can verify parallel rendering by coloring your dataset by the `Process Id` variable, which is not available when running in serial mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which clusters support single-core visualization using Open OnDemand?",
    "answer": "Single-core visualization via Open OnDemand is supported on Nibi and Trillium."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the Open OnDemand portal URLs for Nibi and Trillium?",
    "answer": "The Open OnDemand portal for Nibi is https://ondemand.sharcnet.ca, and for Trillium, it is https://ondemand.scinet.utoronto.ca."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to launch a single-core visualization desktop session on Nibi via Open OnDemand?",
    "answer": "After logging into Open OnDemand, find 'Desktop' under 'Compute Nodes | Compute Desktop', specify a CPU-only Slurm account and 1 CPU core, click 'Launch', wait for the job to start, and then click 'Launch Compute Desktop'. Inside the desktop, open a terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands should be run in the terminal for single-core ParaView visualization once an Open OnDemand desktop session is active?",
    "answer": "You should type `module load paraview/6.0.0` followed by `paraview`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the ParaView GUI application inherently support multiple cores?",
    "answer": "No, the ParaView GUI application itself is single-threaded and cannot directly use multiple cores for true parallel rendering. A client-server setup is required."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which ParaView filters can utilize multithreading?",
    "answer": "Some filters, such as contouring, clipping, or resampling, support multithreading through VTK backends like TBB or OpenMP."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the resource limits for multi-core visualization on Nibi's Open OnDemand?",
    "answer": "On Nibi's Open OnDemand, you can request up to 128GB of memory and up to 8 CPU cores for multi-core visualization."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start a parallel ParaView server within an Open OnDemand desktop session for multi-core visualization with 4 cores?",
    "answer": "First, load the ParaView module with `module load paraview/6.0.0`, then run `mpirun --oversubscribe -np 4 pvserver` in a terminal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps are needed in the ParaView GUI to connect to a parallel ParaView server running within an Open OnDemand desktop session?",
    "answer": "In the ParaView GUI, click 'Connect', then 'Add Server'. Select 'Client/Server' for Server Type, set 'Host' to `localhost`, 'Port' to `11111`, and 'Startup Type' to `Manual`. Finally, click 'Connect' again to establish the connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Large-scale interactive' visualization tab?",
    "answer": "This tab describes an interactive client-server setup for all HPC clusters, where the ParaView client runs on your local computer and the server runs on the remote cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a critical requirement for ParaView client and server versions in a client-server setup?",
    "answer": "ParaView requires the same major version on the local client and the remote host to prevent incompatibility during the client-server connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the 'Remote Render Threshold' setting located in ParaView preferences?",
    "answer": "It is located in ParaView's preferences under `Render View -> Remote/Parallel Rendering Options -> Remote Render Threshold`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the effect of setting the 'Remote Render Threshold' to a default value like 20MB?",
    "answer": "With a default threshold (e.g., 20MB), small renderings will be done on your computer's GPU, providing fast rotation. However, anything modestly intensive (under 20MB) will be shipped to your computer, potentially slowing down visualization depending on your connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the effect of setting the 'Remote Render Threshold' to 0MB?",
    "answer": "Setting the 'Remote Render Threshold' to 0MB means all rendering, including rotation, will be done remotely on the cluster resources, which is good for large data processing but may reduce interactivity."
