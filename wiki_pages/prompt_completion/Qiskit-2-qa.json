    "question": "What is the goal of the example provided?",
    "answer": "The example demonstrates how to create the first Bell state in simulation on Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Python modules are necessary to import for the Bell state example?",
    "answer": "You need to import `AerSimulator` from `qiskit_aer`, `QuantumCircuit` from `qiskit`, and `plot_histogram` from `qiskit.visualization`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is a two-qubit quantum circuit initialized in the example?",
    "answer": "A two-qubit quantum circuit is initialized using the code `circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What operations are applied to qubits to define the Bell state circuit?",
    "answer": "A Hadamard gate is applied to the first qubit (`circuit.h(0)`), followed by a CNOT gate to entangle the first and second qubits (`circuit.cx(0,1)`), and then all qubits are measured (`circuit.measure_all()`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the Hadamard gate (`circuit.h(0)`) in the Bell state circuit?",
    "answer": "The Hadamard gate (`circuit.h(0)`) is applied to create a superposition state on the first qubit."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the CNOT gate (`circuit.cx(0,1)`) in the Bell state circuit?",
    "answer": "The CNOT gate (`circuit.cx(0,1)`) is applied to entangle the first and second qubits."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which simulator is used by default for the Bell state example?",
    "answer": "`AerSimulator` is the default simulator used in the example."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many measurements (shots) are performed in the Bell state simulation?",
    "answer": "The simulation performs 1000 measurements (shots)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you retrieve the measurement counts from a simulation result?",
    "answer": "You retrieve the measurement counts using the method `result.get_counts()`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were the example measurement counts obtained after 1000 shots for the Bell state?",
    "answer": "The example measurement counts were `{'00': 489, '11': 535}`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the simulation results visualized in the example?",
    "answer": "An histogram of the results is displayed using the command `plot_histogram(counts)`."
