    "question": "What is HMMER used for?",
    "answer": "HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for homologs of protein sequences and for making protein sequence alignments. It uses probabilistic models called profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the advantages of HMMER over older tools like BLAST or FASTA?",
    "answer": "HMMER aims to be significantly more accurate and more able to detect remote homologs due to its underlying mathematical models. The HMMER3 project makes it essentially as fast as BLAST."
  },
  {
    "question": "What versions of HMMER are listed?",
    "answer": "HMMER versions 3.2.1, 3.3.2, and 3.4 are listed."
