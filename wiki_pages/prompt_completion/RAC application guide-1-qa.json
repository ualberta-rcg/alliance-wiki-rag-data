  },
  {
    "question": "When should a project apply through the RRG process instead of RPP?",
    "answer": "Projects primarily needing compute resources in a cluster to conduct research should apply through the RRG process instead of RPP."
  },
  {
    "question": "What typically defines a research platform or portal?",
    "answer": "A research platform or portal is a set of community-developed tools, applications, and data integrated via a gateway or suite of applications\u2014usually in a graphical user interface\u2014that is customized to meet the needs of a community of users associated with a specific discipline."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of resources are commonly involved in RPP projects?",
    "answer": "RPP projects typically involve cloud resources, usually through the development of a front-end gateway on persistent virtual machines, with possible backend compute either through cloud compute nodes or job-based submission to national clusters. Many platforms and portals also include large databases."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main requirements for projects applying for RPP?",
