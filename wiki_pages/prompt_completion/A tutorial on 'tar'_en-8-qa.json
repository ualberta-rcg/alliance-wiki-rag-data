    "question": "How do you list the contents of a bzip2 compressed tar file without decompressing it?",
    "answer": "You can list the content of an archive compressed with `bzip2` without decompressing the file by using the `tar -tvjf results.tar.bz2` command. The 'v' option is used to display details, but it's not strictly required."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the `tar -tvjf` command be combined with other utilities like `wc` or `grep`?",
    "answer": "Yes, the `tar -tvjf` command can be combined with a pipe (`|`) and `wc` to count entries, or with a pipe (`|`) and `grep` to search for specific content, similar to how it's used with plain tar files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to determine the size of a file, directory, or archive from the terminal?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `du -sh [your_file ...]` to see the size. For example, `du -sh results.tar work tests`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a large file or tar file be divided into smaller parts?",
    "answer": "A large file or tar file can be divided into small parts using the `split` command with the syntax: `split -b <Size-in-MB><file or tar-file-name><prefix-name>`. For instance, `split -b 100MB results.tar small-res`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-b` option in the `split` command?",
    "answer": "The `-b` option is invoked to fix the size of the small parts that will be created by the `split` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you recover the original file after it has been split into smaller parts using the `split` command?",
    "answer": "To recover the original file, use the `cat` command as follows: `cat small_res* > your_archive_name.tar`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you make the `split` command append numbers instead of alphabets to the names of the smaller files?",
    "answer": "To append numbers in place of alphabets for the output small file names, use the `-d` option with the `split` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some common commands for showing the current directory, listing files, and checking disk usage?",
    "answer": "The `pwd` command shows the present working directory, `ls` lists files and sub-directories, and `du -sh` shows the disk usage for files, directories, or sub-directories."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an important consideration regarding free space when using `gzip` or `bzip2`?",
    "answer": "Applying `gzip` or `bzip2` to a given file requires free space to create the final compressed file. These commands will fail if there is no space left on the device or if you are out of quota."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users on CC clusters check their disk quota?",
    "answer": "On CC clusters, users can use the command `quota` or `quota \u2013s` from their terminal to see if they have enough space to write additional data."
