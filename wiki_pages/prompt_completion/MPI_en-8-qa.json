    "question": "What is the purpose of the `--showme` option in Open MPI compiler wrappers?",
    "answer": "The `--showme` option in Open MPI compiler wrappers prints which compiler will be called and what compiler-options will be added."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do MPI compiler wrappers determine which compiler and version to use?",
    "answer": "The MPI compiler-wrappers will always use the compiler and compiler version that you have loaded with the `module load` command."
