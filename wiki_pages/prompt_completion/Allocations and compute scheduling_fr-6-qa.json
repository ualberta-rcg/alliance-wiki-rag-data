    "question": "What display options are available in the legend of the resource usage portal?",
    "answer": "The legend allows displaying the color for each user, SLURM Raw Usage, SLURM Raw Shares, CCDB allocation, queued job resources, and the daily total."

  {
    "question": "What is 'SLURM Raw Usage'?",
    "answer": "SLURM Raw Usage is a measure obtained from the shares for each account on the clusters, used by the scheduler to determine account priority. It represents the cumulative sum of account usage in billing units, plus a decay period."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are 'SLURM Raw Shares'?",
    "answer": "SLURM Raw Shares are obtained from the shares for each account on the clusters. For rrg-* or rpp-* allocation accounts, they are a straight line corresponding to the account's resource allocation. For default accounts, they evolve over time based on the number of active accounts on the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'CCDB allocation' represent?",
    "answer": "CCDB allocation corresponds to the representation of SLURM Raw Shares within the account profile in CCDB."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are resources for queued jobs displayed in the portal?",
    "answer": "The resources for tasks in the queue are represented by thin gray bars in the columns of the 'Queued jobs' legend option, showing the quantity of resources per day."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users activate or deactivate elements in the legend?",

    "question": "How are SLURM raw shares displayed when a single account is selected?",
    "answer": "When a single account is selected, SLURM raw shares are displayed as a horizontal red line."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I hide or show the SLURM raw shares line?",
    "answer": "You can hide or show the SLURM raw shares line by clicking on 'Display allocation target by default' in the 'Parameters' panel or on 'SLURM Raw Shares' in the legend."

    "answer": "When hovering over a bar, a text indicates the user's name, the day, and the amount of usage for the pointed element (showing specific user usage, not the sum for all users for that day)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do SLURM raw shares behave for default accounts?",
    "answer": "For default accounts, SLURM raw shares evolve over time based on the number of active accounts on the cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can be determined by tracing the SLURM raw shares of a default account?",
    "answer": "Tracing the SLURM raw shares of a default account on a specific cluster can help easily determine the expected usage of that default account on that cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it useful to trace SLURM raw usage for an account?",
    "answer": "Tracing an account's SLURM raw usage helps evaluate the influence of past usage on the account's priority over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what condition is an account's usage considered equivalent to its target share?",
    "answer": "As a general rule, if the SLURM raw usage is 10 times greater than the SLURM raw shares, the account's usage is considered equivalent to its target share (the usage rate the scheduler aims to maintain for the account)."
