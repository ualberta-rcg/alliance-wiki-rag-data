  },
  {
    "question": "What tasks are ideal for using Ansys programs on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "VDI nodes, with their GPU OpenGL acceleration, are ideal for tasks benefiting from high-performance graphics, such as creating or modifying simulation input files, post-processing data, or visualizing simulation results."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you log in to VDI nodes to run Ansys programs?",
    "answer": "To log in, connect with TigerVNC, then open a new terminal window to start one of the program versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended maximum job size for parallel Ansys jobs on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "The maximum job size for any parallel job run on gra-vdi should be limited to 16 cores to avoid overloading the servers and impacting other users."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can two simultaneous Ansys GUI jobs be run on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To run two simultaneous GUI jobs (16 cores max each), establish two independent VNC sessions: connect the first to `gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca` and the second to `gra-vdi4.sharcnet.ca`, then start Ansys in GUI mode within each session."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a time limit for running Ansys simulations on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "No, unlike compute nodes which impose Slurm limits, there is no time limit constraint on gra-vdi when running simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules and commands are needed to run Ansys Fluids on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions), then run `unset SESSION_MANAGER` followed by `fluent`, `cfx5`, or `icemcfd`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'Qt: Session management error' be prevented when starting Ansys Fluent on VDI?",
    "answer": "Unset the `SESSION_MANAGER` environment variable before starting Fluent to prevent the 'Qt: Session management error' message."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you fix the 'Error segmentation violation' popup when starting ICEM CFD on VDI?",
    "answer": "If the 'Error segmentation violation' popup appears, do not click OK. Instead, go to Settings -> Display, tick X11, Apply, OK, and then File -> Exit. The popup should not reappear on restart."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules and commands are required to launch Ansys Mapdl in GUI mode on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions). Launch Mapdl directly with `mapdl -g`, or by running `unset SESSION_MANAGER; launcher` and clicking the RUN button."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between `runwb2` and `runwb2-gui` for launching Workbench on VDI nodes using `SnEnv`?",
    "answer": "The `runwb2` command for `SnEnv` modules uses the SHARCNET license server by default. `runwb2-gui` allows using a remote license server by reading `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` or interactively selecting the CMC server."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'Software rasterizer found' warning be avoided when starting Fluent from Workbench 2025R1?",
    "answer": "To avoid the warning, either add `HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` in Fluent Launcher's Environment tab before starting, or set `export HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` in your environment before launching Workbench."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended core and memory limits for Ansys Mechanical and Fluent in Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "For Mechanical, tick 'Distributed' and use a maximum of 24 cores. For Fluent, untick 'Distributed' and use a maximum of 12 cores. Do not use more than 128GB memory for either."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many cores should be used for Ansys pre-processing or post-processing work on gra-vdi without running calculations?",
    "answer": "Only use 4 cores for Ansys pre-processing or post-processing work on gra-vdi to avoid unnecessary HPC license checkout."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can frozen Ansys Workbench or programs be terminated on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "If Ansys is not behaving properly, open a new terminal on gra-vdi and run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|fluent|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE|mono\"` to fully kill all Ansys processes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if Ansys problems persist on gra-vdi, especially after working on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "If problems persist, try running `rm -rf .ansys` if you previously worked in the GUI on compute nodes before working on gra-vdi."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the known issues with Ansys 2025R1 on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Ansys 2025R1 is not usable with the SHARCNET license server until an August 2025 upgrade, is only available under `CcEnv`, and its GUI for some programs like Mechanical does not work properly and will not be fixed as gra-vdi is retiring soon."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules and commands are used to launch Ansys Ensight on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load `module load SnEnv` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions back to 2021R2), then run `ensight`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should Ansys Rocky use GPUs when run on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "No, Ansys Rocky should only be used with CPUs on gra-vdi because the machine has only one GPU, which is intended for graphics."
