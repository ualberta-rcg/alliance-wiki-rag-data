    "question": "What are the limitations of the ansys/2025R1 module on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "The ansys/2025R1 module is not yet usable with the SHARCNET license server (expected to be ready in early August/2025). On gra-vdi, versions ansys/2025 or newer are not installed under SnEnv and must be used under CcEnv. Additionally, the GUI interface for some programs, like Ansys Mechanical, in ansys/2025R1 do not work properly on gra-vdi and will not be fixed as gra-vdi is retiring soon."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I run Ensight on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "To run Ensight on gra-vdi, first load the necessary modules: `module load SnEnv` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions back to 2021R2), then execute the command `ensight`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which module versions are available for Rocky on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "On gra-vdi, Rocky can be loaded using `module load clumod ansysrocky/2023R2 CcEnv StdEnv/2020 ansys/2023R2`, `module load clumod ansysrocky/2024R2.0 CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys/2024R2.04`, or `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2023 ansys/2025R1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands can be used to start Rocky programs on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "You can use `Rocky`, `Rocky-gui`, `RockySolver` (untested), or `RockySchedular` (untested) to start Rocky programs on gra-vdi."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which clusters is Rocky for versions 2024R2 or older available?",
    "answer": "Rocky for versions 2024R2 or older is currently only available on gra-vdi and graham clusters, with installation on all clusters expected in June."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the status of Rocky for versions 2025R1 and greater?",
    "answer": "Rocky for versions 2025R1 and greater is bundled in the ansys module on all clusters but is not yet supported by the SHARCNET license server."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should I use GPUs with Rocky on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "No, Rocky should only be used with CPUs and not GPUs when run on gra-vdi, as the machine only has one GPU intended for graphics."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the SHARCNET license available for Rocky?",
    "answer": "Yes, the SHARCNET license includes Rocky and is free for all researchers across the Alliance to use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I run Ansys GUI programs remotely via SSH?",
    "answer": "Yes, some Ansys GUI programs can be run remotely on a cluster compute node by X forwarding over SSH to your local desktop, though this approach is untested and unsupported."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the drawbacks of using SSH for Ansys GUI programs compared to VNC?",
    "answer": "SSH for Ansys GUI programs is untested and unsupported, relies on a properly set up X display server or X client emulator, has unacceptably slow interactive response times, and very slow startup times (e.g., 40 minutes via SSH vs. 34 seconds via VNC)."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what purposes might SSH still be considered for Ansys GUI programs despite its slowness?",
    "answer": "Despite the potential slowness, using SSH might still be of interest if your only goal is to open a simulation and perform some basic menu operations or run some calculations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can use the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET Ansys license is free for academic use by any Alliance researcher on any Alliance system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the solver and geometry limits for the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "The installed software with the SHARCNET Ansys license does not have any solver or geometry limits."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of research is permitted with the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET license may be used for Publishable Academic Research but not for any private or commercial purposes, as this is strictly prohibited by the license terms."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Ansys products are included in the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET Ansys license is based on the Multiphysics Campus Solution and includes products such as HF, EM, Electronics HPC, Mechanical, CFD, ROCKY, and LS-DYNA."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are Lumerical and SpaceClaim covered by the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "Lumerical, acquired by ANSYS in 2020, is not currently covered by the SHARCNET license. SpaceClaim is technically covered by the SHARCNET license, but it is not installed on Alliance systems since they are all Linux-based."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many `anshpc` licenses are included with the SHARCNET license, and what are they used for?",
    "answer": "A pool of 1986 `anshpc` licenses is included with the SHARCNET license to support running large-scale parallel simulations with most Ansys products."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended for efficient use of `anshpc` licenses?",
    "answer": "Scaling tests should be run before launching long jobs to ensure efficient use of `anshpc` licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a parallel job doesn't achieve at least 50% CPU utilization?",
    "answer": "Parallel jobs that do not achieve at least 50% CPU utilization will probably be flagged by the system, resulting in a follow-up by an Alliance team member."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the limitations on simultaneous jobs and hpc cores per researcher for the SHARCNET Ansys license?",
    "answer": "The SHARCNET Ansys license permits each researcher to run a maximum of 8 simultaneous jobs using up to 512 hpc cores, with combinations like 1x512, 2x256, 4x128, or 8x64 across all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if there's a shortage of `anshpc` licenses?",
    "answer": "If a job fails on startup due to a shortage of licenses, it will need to be manually resubmitted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What measures might be taken if `anshpc` license shortages persist?",
    "answer": "If license shortages persist, the total job limit per researcher might be decreased (to 6 or 4) and/or the total hpc core limit per researcher might be decreased (to 384 or 256 cores)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the advice for researchers needing more than 512 `anshpc` cores?",
    "answer": "Researchers needing more than 512 `anshpc` cores should consider using a local ANSYS License server at their institution, if available, and contributing towards expanding it if necessary."
