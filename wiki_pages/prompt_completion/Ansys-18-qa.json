    "question": "What are the resource limits for Ansys programs on Graham's VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Ansys programs can be run for up to 7 days on Graham's VDI nodes using 8 cores (16 cores max) and 128GB memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main advantage of using the VDI System for Ansys programs?",
    "answer": "The VDI System provides GPU OpenGL acceleration, making it ideal for tasks that benefit from high-performance graphics, such as creating or modifying simulation input files, post-processing data, or visualizing simulation results."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you log in to Graham's VDI nodes to run Ansys programs?",
    "answer": "To log in, connect with TigerVNC, then open a new terminal window and start one of the program versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum recommended job size for parallel jobs on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "The maximum job size for any parallel job run on gra-vdi should be limited to 16 cores to avoid overloading the servers and impacting other users."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I run two simultaneous GUI Ansys jobs on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Establish two independent VNC sessions: connect the first to `gra-vdi3.sharcnet.ca` and the second to `gra-vdi4.sharcnet.ca`. Then, within each session, start Ansys in GUI mode and run your simulation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a time limit for running simulations on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Unlike compute nodes, there is no time limit constraint on gra-vdi when running simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules should be loaded to run Ansys Fluent, CFX, or ICEM CFD on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load `CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions), then run `unset SESSION_MANAGER` followed by `fluent | cfx5 | icemcfd`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you prevent the 'Qt: Session management error' message when starting Fluent on VDI?",
    "answer": "Unsetting `SESSION_MANAGER` prevents the 'Qt: Session management error: None of the authentication protocols specified are supported' message from appearing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps should be taken to resolve an 'Error segmentation violation' popup when starting ICEM CFD on VDI?",
    "answer": "Do not click 'OK' on the popup. Instead, go to the Settings Tab -> Display -> tick X11 -> Apply -> OK -> File -> Exit (this only needs to be done once)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start Ansys Mapdl with a GUI on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load `CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions), then run `mapdl -g` or `unset SESSION_MANAGER; launcher -> click RUN button`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are used to load Ansys Workbench for locally installed versions via SnEnv on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load `SnEnv` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions), then use `runwb2` or `runwb2-gui`."
  },
  {
    "question": "By default, which license server does `runwb2` use when loaded with `SnEnv` on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "The `runwb2` command (for locally installed) Ansys modules provided by `SnEnv` will use the SHARCNET license server by default."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a remote license server be used with Ansys Workbench when launched via `SnEnv` on VDI?",
    "answer": "Start Workbench with `runwb2-gui` instead of `runwb2`, as it reads your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file and offers an interactive option for the CMC server."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are used to load newer Ansys Workbench versions via CcEnv on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load `CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2025R1` (or newer versions), then run `runwb2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the status of Ansys 2025R1's GUI for programs like Ansys Mechanical on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "The GUI interface for some programs available in `ansys/2025R1` such as Ansys Mechanical does not work properly on gra-vdi and will not be fixed as gra-vdi is to be retired soon."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user eliminate the 'Warning: Software rasterizer found, hardware acceleration will be disabled' in Fluent when launched from Workbench on VDI?",
    "answer": "Before clicking the start button in the Fluent Launcher panel, click the Environment tab and copy/paste `HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` into the empty input box, or set `export HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` in your environment before starting Workbench."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended core and memory limits for running Ansys Mechanical and Fluent within Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "For Mechanical, tick Distributed and specify a maximum of 24 cores. For Fluent, untick Distributed and specify a maximum of 12 cores. Do not attempt to use more than 128GB memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many cores should be used for pre-processing or post-processing work in Ansys Workbench on gra-vdi if no calculations are being run?",
    "answer": "Only use 4 cores for pre-processing or post-processing work to avoid checking out unnecessary HPC licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to terminate frozen or improperly shutdown Ansys processes on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Open a new terminal window on gra-vdi and run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|fluent|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE|mono\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are used to load Ansys Ensight on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load `SnEnv` and `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions back to 2021R2), then run `ensight`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should GPUs be used when running Ansys Rocky on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "No, Rocky should only be used with CPUs and not GPUs when run on gra-vdi, as the machine only has one GPU intended for graphics."
