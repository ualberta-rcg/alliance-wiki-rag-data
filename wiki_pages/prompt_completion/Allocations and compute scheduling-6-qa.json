  {
    "question": "What metrics can be selected from the 'Metric' pull-down control in the Slurm portal's 'Parameters' panel?",
    "answer": "You can select from CPU, CPU-equivalent, RGU, RGU-equivalent, Memory, Billing, gpu, and all specific GPU models available on the selected cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two summation options available in the Slurm portal's 'Parameters' panel?",
    "answer": "The 'Summation' pull-down allows you to switch between the daily 'Total' and 'Running total'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is usage represented when 'Total' is selected for summation in the Slurm portal?",
    "answer": "If 'Total' is selected, each bar of the histogram represents the total usage in that one day."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'Running total' summation mean in the Slurm portal's usage histogram?",
    "answer": "When 'Running total' is selected, each bar represents the sum of that day's usage and all previous days back to the beginning of the time interval."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the 'Running total' summation affect the 'Allocation Target' display?",
    "answer": "If the 'Allocation Target' is displayed with 'Running total', it is similarly adjusted to show the running total of the target usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if 'Include Running jobs' is set to 'No' in the Slurm portal?",
    "answer": "If 'Include Running jobs' is set to 'No', the figure shows only data from records of completed jobs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of displaying the running total of account usage alongside the allocation target?",
    "answer": "It displays how an account deviates from its target share over the period displayed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of values are shown in the running total view for usage and allocation target?",
    "answer": "The values in this view are the cumulative sum across days from the 'total' summation view for both the usage and allocation target."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is considered a good interval to inspect the scheduler\u2019s performance in maintaining an account's fair share?",
    "answer": "A good interval to use is to display the past 30 days."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users view information on the usage of compute resources by their groups?",
    "answer": "Information on the usage of compute resources by your groups can be found by logging into the CCDB and navigating to 'My Account > View Group Usage'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do the CPU and GPU core year values in CCDB's usage summaries represent core-equivalent measures?",
    "answer": "No, the values summarized in these pages do not represent core-equivalent measures."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the consequence of CCDB usage values not matching core-equivalent measures?",
    "answer": "In the case of large memory jobs, the usage values in CCDB will not match the cluster scheduler\u2019s representation of the account usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What options are available in the first tab bar of the CCDB 'View Group Usage' section?",
    "answer": "The first tab bar offers options for 'By Compute Resource', 'By Resource Allocation Project', 'By Submitter', and 'Storage usage'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is shown in the 'Usage by Compute Resource' view in CCDB?",
    "answer": "This view shows the usage of compute resources per cluster used by groups owned by you or of which you are a member for the current allocation year starting April 1st, including total usage to date and projected usage."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users get a monthly breakdown of usage from the 'Usage by Compute Resource' table in CCDB?",
    "answer": "From the 'Extra Info' column of the usage table, 'Show monthly usage' can be clicked to display a further breakdown of the usage by month."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users see usage breakdown by individual submitters in the 'Usage by Compute Resource' table in CCDB?",
    "answer": "By clicking 'Show submitter usage' from the 'Extra Info' column, a breakdown for the specific users submitting jobs on that cluster is displayed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is provided under the 'Usage by Resource Allocation Project' tab in CCDB?",
    "answer": "This tab displays RAPIs (Resource Allocation Project Identifiers) for the selected allocation year, along with detailed information for each project, including account name, project title and ownership, and allocation and usage summaries across all clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is GPU usage presented for resource allocation projects in CCDB?",
    "answer": "For resource allocation projects with GPU usage, the table is broken down into usage on various GPU models and measured in Reference GPU Units (RGUs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the 'Usage by Submitter' view in CCDB show?",
    "answer": "The 'Usage by Submitter' view shows usage grouped by the users that submitted jobs from within the resource allocation projects, aggregated across systems."
