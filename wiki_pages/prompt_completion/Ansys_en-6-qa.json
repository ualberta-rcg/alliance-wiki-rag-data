    "question": "What should I do if I encounter an error about a missing writable `.flrecent` file for an Ansys Fluent job?",
    "answer": "If a link to a writable `.flrecent` file does not exist, you should remove the existing `~/.flrecent` if it's there, and then run `ln -s $SCRATCH/.flrecent ~/.flrecent`. After this, you can try submitting your job again."
  },
  {
    "question": "What directories and files are created if the required Ansys configuration links are missing in the provided script?",
    "answer": "If links to `.ansys`, `.fluentconf`, or `.flrecent` are missing, the script will create the directories `$SCRATCH/.ansys` and `$SCRATCH/.fluentconf` and touch the file `$SCRATCH/.flrecent`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is Ansys Fluent launched on a single node according to the Niagara 'by node' script?",
    "answer": "On a single node, Fluent is launched using the command `fluent -g $MYVERSION -t $NCORES -affinity=0 -mpi=intel -pshmem -i $MYJOURNALFILE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is Ansys Fluent launched on multiple nodes using the Niagara 'by node' script?",
    "answer": "On multiple nodes, Fluent is launched using the command `fluent -g $MYVERSION -t $NCORES -affinity=0 -mpi=intel -ssh -pib -cnf=$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR/machinefile-$SLURM_JOB_ID -i $MYJOURNALFILE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are the Fluent 'License requeue' scripts appropriate to use?",
    "answer": "These scripts should only be used for Fluent jobs that are known to complete normally without errors but typically require multiple attempts to check out licenses due to shortages."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should Fluent 'License requeue' scripts be avoided?",
    "answer": "They are not recommended for Fluent jobs that might run for a long time before crashing or that complete with unresolved journal file warnings, as such simulations would be repeatedly run from the beginning until the maximum requeue attempts are reached."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after a job successfully completes when using a Fluent 'License requeue' script?",
    "answer": "If a job submitted with a 'License requeue' script completes successfully, a 'Job completed successfully! Exiting now.' message will be displayed, and the entire job array (`scancel $SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID`) will be terminated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the behavior of a Fluent 'License requeue' script if a job attempt fails?",
    "answer": "If a job attempt fails, a message indicating the failure will be printed. If the current attempt is less than the total number of requeue attempts, the job will be resubmitted. Otherwise, if all attempts have failed, it will exit."
