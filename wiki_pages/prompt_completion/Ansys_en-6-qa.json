    "question": "What should I do if I encounter an error stating 'A link to a writable .fluentconf directory does not exist'?",
    "answer": "If you receive an 'ERROR: A link to a writable .fluentconf directory does not exist,' you should remove `~/.fluentconf` if it exists and then run the command `ln -s $SCRATCH/.fluentconf ~/.fluentconf`. Afterward, try submitting your job again."

  {
    "question": "What Fluent command is used for a single-node job on Trillium, as specified in the script?",
    "answer": "For a single-node job, the command is `fluent -g $MYVERSION -t $NCORES -affinity=0 -mpi=intel -pshmem -i $MYJOURNALFILE`."
  },

    "answer": "For a multi-node job, the command is `fluent -g $MYVERSION -t $NCORES -affinity=0 -mpi=intel -ssh -pib -cnf=$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR/machinefile-$SLURM_JOB_ID -i $MYJOURNALFILE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should the license requeue scripts for Fluent jobs be utilized?",
    "answer": "These scripts should only be used for Fluent jobs that are known to complete normally without generating errors, but frequently require multiple attempts to check out licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what types of Fluent jobs are the license requeue scripts not recommended?",
    "answer": "They are not recommended for Fluent jobs that might run for a long time before crashing, or for jobs that complete but contain unresolved journal file warnings, as these would cause simulations to be repeated unnecessarily."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the alternative for Fluent jobs not suitable for license requeue scripts?",
    "answer": "For jobs not suitable for license requeue scripts, the general purpose scripts (not the requeue ones) should be used instead."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the number of requeue attempts specified in the `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh`?",
    "answer": "The number of requeue attempts is specified by the `#SBATCH --array=1-5%1` line, where '5' indicates the number of attempts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Ansys module version is specified for the `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh`?",
    "answer": "The script specifies `ansys/2023R2` or newer versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a job completes successfully when using a license requeue script?",
    "answer": "If a job completes successfully, the script will print 'Job completed successfully! Exiting now.' and then cancel the entire job array using `scancel $SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the script's behavior if a job attempt fails but more requeue attempts are available?",
    "answer": "If a job attempt fails and more requeue attempts are available, the script will print a failure message and 'Resubmitting job now \u2026'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What message is displayed if all requeue attempts for a job fail?",
    "answer": "If all job attempts fail, the script will display 'All job attempts failed exiting now.'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default time limit configured in the `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh`?",
    "answer": "The default time limit is `00-03:00` (3 hours)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many compute nodes are requested by default in the `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh`?",
    "answer": "The script requests 1 compute node by default (`#SBATCH --nodes=1`), which is the maximum for Narval."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default number of cores per compute node specified in the `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh`?",
    "answer": "The default number of cores per compute node is 32 (`#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=32`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the memory allocation setting in the `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh`?",
    "answer": "The memory setting is `#SBATCH --mem=0`, which allocates all memory per compute node and should not be changed."

    "question": "What is the purpose of `slurm_hl2hl.py` in the `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh`?",
    "answer": "`slurm_hl2hl.py --format ANSYS-FLUENT` is used to generate a machinefile (`/tmp/machinefile-$SLURM_JOB_ID`) for Fluent."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the total number of cores (`NCORES`) calculated in the `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh`?",
    "answer": "`NCORES` is calculated by multiplying the number of nodes (`SLURM_NNODES`), tasks per node (`SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE`), and CPUs per task (`SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`)."
