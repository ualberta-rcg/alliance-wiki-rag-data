  {
    "question": "What error occurs if the `$HOME/.flrecent` file is not a writable link?",
    "answer": "An 'ERROR: A link to a writable .flrecent file does not exist.' message is displayed, and the current job is aborted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I resolve the error related to the `$HOME/.flrecent` file?",
    "answer": "Remove `~/.flrecent` if it exists, then run `ln -s $SCRATCH/.flrecent ~/.flrecent` to create a symbolic link to a writable location."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which directories and files are created by the Fluent script before execution?",
    "answer": "The script creates `$SCRATCH/.ansys` and `$SCRATCH/.fluentconf` directories, and touches the `$SCRATCH/.flrecent` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Fluent command to run a simulation on a single node with Intel MPI?",
    "answer": "The command is `fluent -g $MYVERSION -t $NCORES -affinity=0 -mpi=intel -pshmem -i $MYJOURNALFILE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Fluent command to run a simulation on multiple nodes with Intel MPI?",
    "answer": "The command is `fluent -g $MYVERSION -t $NCORES -affinity=0 -mpi=intel -ssh -pib -cnf=$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR/machinefile-$SLURM_JOB_ID -i $MYJOURNALFILE`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are license requeue scripts recommended for Fluent jobs?",
    "answer": "They are recommended for Fluent jobs that complete normally but frequently require multiple attempts to check out licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should license requeue scripts NOT be used for Fluent jobs?",
    "answer": "They are not recommended for jobs that might run for a long time before crashing or those with unresolved journal file warnings, as this would repeatedly restart the simulation from the beginning."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum number of requeue attempts specified in the example `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh`?",
    "answer": "The example script specifies a maximum of 5 requeue attempts using `#SBATCH --array=1-5%1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Slurm directive for the time limit in the `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh` example?",
    "answer": "The time limit is set to 3 hours with `#SBATCH --time=00-03:00`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many nodes are requested by default in the `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh` example?",
    "answer": "The script requests 1 compute node by default using `#SBATCH --nodes=1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules are loaded for a Fluent job using `script-flu-bynode+requeue.sh` with `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "The modules loaded are `StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2023R2` (or newer versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the `NCORES` variable calculated in the Fluent requeue script?",
    "answer": "`NCORES` is calculated as the product of `SLURM_NNODES`, `SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE`, and `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a Fluent job, configured with a requeue script, completes successfully?",
    "answer": "The script will output 'Job completed successfully! Exiting now.' and then `scancel` the job array."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a Fluent job fails an attempt when using a requeue script?",
    "answer": "It will output 'Job attempt $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID of $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT failed due to license or simulation issue!' and, if more attempts remain, 'Resubmitting job now \u2026'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users monitor a requeued job to ensure failure is license-related?",
    "answer": "It is strongly recommended to monitor and inspect each Slurm output file to confirm that each requeue attempt is license-related."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if a requeued job fails due to a simulation issue instead of a license shortage?",
    "answer": "Immediately manually kill the job progression with `scancel jobid` and correct the problem to avoid lost compute time."
