  {
    "question": "What is the typical size of `/localscratch` and how is it shared?",
    "answer": "/localscratch is approximately 800GB and is shared by all jobs running on the same node."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should I choose the G16 (G09, G03) option instead of `g16` for saving default runtime files?",
    "answer": "You should use the G16 (G09, G03) option if your job files are bigger than or close to 800GB, as `/localscratch` (where `g16` saves files) has this size limit."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example of a `g16` job script?",
    "answer": "An example `g16` job script includes SBATCH directives for account, memory, time, and CPUs, loads the Gaussian module (e.g., `gaussian/g16.c01`), and executes `g16 < name.com >& name.log`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you submit a Gaussian job script on the clusters?",
    "answer": "You submit a job script using the command `sbatch mysub.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it good practice to run interactive Gaussian jobs on a login node?",
    "answer": "No, it is not a good practice to run interactive Gaussian jobs on a login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I start an interactive Gaussian session on a compute node?",
    "answer": "First, navigate to your input file directory, then use an `salloc` command like `salloc --time=1:0:0 --cpus-per-task=8 --mem=10g`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do `G16` and `g16` commands differ in saving runtime files during an interactive session?",
    "answer": "When using `G16 g16_test2.com` in an interactive session, runtime files (like .rwf) are saved to `/scratch/yourid/jobid/`. When using `g16 < g16_test2.com >& g16_test2.log &`, runtime files are saved to `/localscratch/yourid/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "From what file can Gaussian jobs always be restarted?",
    "answer": "Gaussian jobs can always be restarted from the previous `.rwf` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of Gaussian calculations can be restarted from the `.chk` file?",
    "answer": "Geometry optimization can be restarted from the `.chk` file as usual."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which one-step computations can be restarted from the `.rwf` file?",
    "answer": "Analytic frequency calculations (including ROA and VCD with ONIOM), CCSD and EOM-CCSD, NMR, Polar=OptRot, CID, CISD, CCD, QCISD, and BD energies can be restarted from the `.rwf` file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is required in a Gaussian restart input file?",
    "answer": "A restart input file needs to specify the path to the previous `.rwf` file using `%rwf`, include `%NoSave`, `%chk`, `%mem`, `%nprocs`, and have `#p restart` on the keywords line, followed by a blank line."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find example input files and run scripts for different Gaussian versions?",
    "answer": "Example input files and run scripts (`*.sh`) can be found in `/opt/software/gaussian/version/examples/`, where 'version' can be `g03.d10`, `g09.e01`, or `g16.b01`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Gaussian version includes NBO7, and how are NBO keywords handled in it?",
    "answer": "NBO7 is included only in the `g16.c01` version, where both `nbo6` and `nbo7` keywords will run NBO7."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which Gaussian versions is NBO6 available?",
    "answer": "NBO6 is available in `g09.e01` and `g16.b01` versions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a recorded webinar about Gaussian16 and NBO7?",
    "answer": "Yes, there is a recorded webinar/tutorial from 2022 titled 'Gaussian16 and NBO7 on Graham and Cedar'."

  {
    "question": "Where can I find suggestions for resolving Gaussian error messages?",
    "answer": "Suggestions for resolving Gaussian error messages can be found on the [[Gaussian error messages]] page."
