  {
    "question": "Which compression methods are recommended for use with `tar`?",
    "answer": "We recommend either `xz` or `gzip` compression methods."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create a compressed tar archive using `xz` for a directory named 'project1'?",

  {
    "question": "What are the typical characteristics of `xz` compression compared to `gzip`?",

  {
    "question": "Can you compress a `tar` file in a separate step after it's created?",
