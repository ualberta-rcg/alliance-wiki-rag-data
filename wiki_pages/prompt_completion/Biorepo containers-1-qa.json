    "question": "What is a common method for distributing software with complex dependencies?",
    "answer": "Containers are now a common method of distributing software, especially software with complex dependencies."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which container management system is popular?",
    "answer": "Container management systems such as Docker are popular."
  },
  {
    "question": "What containerization system do Alliance systems support?",
    "answer": "Alliance systems support containerization using Apptainer (formerly Singularity)."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might a user choose to deposit container images into the shared repository rather than just their project space?",
    "answer": "Users might choose to deposit container images into the repository if they have collaborators that need to share a container, if they wish to run the same container on many systems, or if they need to preserve a complex workflow for some period of time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who operates the repository of Apptainer images on Alliance systems?",
    "answer": "The Research Software National Team (RSNT) and the Bioinformatics National Team (BNT) operate a repository of Apptainer images."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are the Apptainer images in the repository stored?",
    "answer": "The Apptainer images are stored in CVMFS."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of the Bioinformatics National Team (BNT) regarding the container repository?",
    "answer": "The BNT maintains the portion of that repository of interest to bioinformatics researchers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of using the container repository?",
    "answer": "The repository reduces the effort to run a containerized workflow on our infrastructure, allows for the hard work of creating workflows to be shared between members of the research community, and enables better research reproducibility."
  },
  {
    "question": "Provide an example of a use case for the container repository related to reproducibility.",
    "answer": "A container with a mature workflow for a clinical study that must remain stable for a long time (e.g., 3-5 years) is a use case where reproducibility is of great importance."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might a container be useful for a workflow that requires Conda?",
    "answer": "A container can be used when the desired tools must be or are much more easily installed with Conda or a similar package manager, especially if the workflow cannot easily be ported to use pip and our modules."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can containers facilitate widely-used workflows like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)?",
    "answer": "A container can include commonly used tools, prerequisite libraries, and system files for such workflows, making it easier to update existing tools or install new ones."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are container images contributed to this service meant to be private?",
    "answer": "No, this service makes container images available to all users on Alliance systems. If a container or its workflow should be kept private, this service should not be used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the licensing requirements for applications within a contributed container?",
    "answer": "All applications in a container must be open source and governed by a license that allows us to distribute the software in this manner."
  },
  {
    "question": "What format of container images should be published on CVMFS for this service?",
    "answer": "Only the sandbox format of container images (i.e., an unpacked directory) should be published on CVMFS, not .sif files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is required when submitting a container image for incorporation into the system?",
    "answer": "Contributors must provide a brief description, an Apptainer or Singularity recipe file (ensuring reproducibility and pinned versions), instructions/examples for complex workflows, the intended audience, and a justification for why the application cannot be provided as a software module or Python wheel."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is important for the Apptainer or Singularity recipe file provided for a container?",
    "answer": "The recipe must be reproducible, and the version of software being installed should be pinned as much as possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who should be contacted for more details or questions about contributing a container?",
    "answer": "Users should contact Technical support for more details or any follow-up questions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'timsconvert_v1.0.0' container?",
    "answer": "The 'timsconvert_v1.0.0' container is used to convert raw Bruker timsTOF Pro and fleX MS data formats to open source data formats."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who contributed the 'timsconvert_v1.0.0' container?",
    "answer": "Jean-Francois Lucier contributed the 'timsconvert_v1.0.0' container."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'ncov-tools' used for?",
    "answer": "'ncov-tools' is a QC pipeline on coronavirus sequencing results."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who contributed the 'ncov-tools' container?",
    "answer": "Jose Hector Galvez contributed the 'ncov-tools' container."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'genpipes'?",
    "answer": "'genpipes' is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who contributed the 'genpipes' container?",
    "answer": "Jose Hector Galvez contributed the 'genpipes' container."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the primary ways of deploying software on Alliance systems, aside from containers?",
    "answer": "The primary way of deploying software on Alliance systems is through modules and python wheels."
