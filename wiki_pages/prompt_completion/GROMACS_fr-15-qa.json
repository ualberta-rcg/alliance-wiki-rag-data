  {
    "question": "What is GROMACS-LS used for?",
    "answer": "GROMACS-LS and the MDStress library allow for the calculation of local stress fields from molecular dynamics simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which library is included with the GROMACS-LS module?",
    "answer": "The MDStress library is included in the GROMACS-LS module."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find documentation about the GROMACS-LS method?",
    "answer": "The manual `Local_stress.pdf` contains information on the method and several publications for reference."
  },
  {
    "question": "How have the basic commands for GROMACS-LS changed since version 5?",
    "answer": "Since version 5, you should use commands like `gmx_LS mdrun` and `gmx_LS trjconv` instead of `mdrun_LS` and `trjconv_LS`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can an older GROMACS-LS version read a .tpr file created by a newer GROMACS version?",
    "answer": "No, an older version of GROMACS-LS cannot read a .tpr file that has been simulated with a more recent GROMACS version (e.g., 2024), as new options are added to the format specification with each major release."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one create a .tpr file compatible with GROMACS-LS 2016.3 for analysis from a newer GROMACS simulation?",
    "answer": "You can use `gmx_LS grompp` or `gmx grompp` from GROMACS version 2016.6 to create a new .tpr file using the same input files (*.mdp, topol.top, *.itp, *.gro, etc.) that were used to create the original simulation's .tpr file. This new .tpr will then be compatible with GROMACS-LS 2016.3."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modifications might be needed for .mdp files when preparing a .tpr for GROMACS-LS 2016.3?",
    "answer": "If the .mdp files used keywords or features not present in 2016 (e.g., `pcouple = C-rescale`), you must modify or delete them (e.g., change to `pcouple = Berendsen`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the technical limitations of GROMACS-LS?",
    "answer": "GROMACS-LS requires double precision, does not support MPI, SIMD hardware acceleration, or GPUs, and can only use a single CPU core, making it much slower than the unoptimized version of GROMACS."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the `gromacs-ls/2016.3` and `gromacs/2016.6` modules be loaded concurrently?",
    "answer": "Yes, unlike other patched GROMACS versions, the `gromacs-ls/2016.3` and `gromacs/2016.6` modules can be loaded at the same time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are needed to load GROMACS-LS 2016.3 for CPU usage?",
    "answer": "To use GROMACS-LS 2016.3 on CPUs, you need to load `StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 gromacs-ls/2016.3`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `gromacs/2016.6` module in the context of GROMACS-LS?",
    "answer": "The `gromacs/2016.6` module can be used to prepare .tpr input files for GROMACS-LS, especially when dealing with compatibility issues from newer GROMACS versions."
