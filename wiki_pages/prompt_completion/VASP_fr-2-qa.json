    "question": "How do I load VASP version 6.4.2 on the Trillium cluster?",
    "answer": "To load VASP 6.4.2 on Trillium, you need to execute the following module commands:\n```\nmodule load StdEnv/2023 intel/2023.2.1 intelmpi/2021.9.0 hdf5/1.14.2\nmodule use /opt/software/commercial/modules\nmodule load vasp/6.4.2\n```"
  },
  {
    "question": "Where are the VASP pseudopotentials located on Cedar and Graham?",
    "answer": "The VASP pseudopotentials are located in `$EBROOTVASP/pseudopotentials/` on Cedar and Graham."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to access the VASP pseudopotentials?",
    "answer": "The VASP module must be loaded to access the pseudopotentials."
  },
  {
    "question": "What executable programs are available for VASP 4.6?",
    "answer": "For VASP 4.6, the available executables are: `vasp` for standard NVT calculations with non-gamma k-points, `vasp-gamma` for standard NVT calculations with only gamma k-points, and `makeparam` to estimate the required memory for VASP operations on a specific cluster."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which executables are available for VASP versions 5.4.1, 5.4.4, and 6.1.0 without CUDA?",
    "answer": "For VASP 5.4.1, 5.4.4, and 6.1.0 (without CUDA), the available executables are: `vasp_std` for standard NVT calculations and non-gamma k-points, `vasp_gam` for standard NVT calculations with only gamma k-points, and `vasp_ncl` for NPT calculations with non-gamma k-points."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the executable programs for VASP-5.4.4 and 6.1.0 with CUDA?",
    "answer": "For VASP-5.4.4 and 6.1.0 (with CUDA), the available executables are: `vasp_gpu` for standard NVT calculations with gamma and non-gamma k-points, and `vasp_gpu_ncl` for NPT calculations with gamma and non-gamma k-points."
  },
  {
    "question": "What extensions are incorporated into VASP?",
    "answer": "The two extensions incorporated into VASP are Transition State Tools and VASPsol."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if the VASP version I need is not available?",
    "answer": "If the VASP version you want to use is not offered, you can either build it yourself or ask the technical support to build and install it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Vasp-GPU executables be used on CPUs?",
    "answer": "Yes, Vasp-GPU executables can be used on both CPUs and GPUs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommendation for optimal use of Vasp-GPU?",
    "answer": "It is strongly recommended to perform benchmarking with one or two GPUs to ensure optimal utilization, as basic calculations on GPUs are much more costly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was observed in the VASP benchmark for crystalline Si with 256 atoms regarding GPU performance?",
    "answer": "With 1 CPU, the performance with 1 or 2 GPUs was more than 5 times better than without GPU. However, the performance varied little between 1 and 2 GPUs; in fact, the utilization of 2 GPUs was about 50% in the monitoring system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the provided VASP job script example (`vasp_job.sh`)?",
    "answer": "The provided `vasp_job.sh` script executes VASP in parallel using the Slurm scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many MPI processes and how much memory per CPU does the `vasp_job.sh` script request?",
    "answer": "The `vasp_job.sh` script requests four MPI processes (`#SBATCH --ntasks=4`) and 1024MB of memory per CPU (`#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1024M`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the time limit set in the `vasp_job.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The time limit set in the `vasp_job.sh` script is 5 minutes (`#SBATCH --time=0-00:05`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `<ACCOUNT>` represent in the VASP job script example?",
    "answer": "`<ACCOUNT>` represents the name of the Slurm account. You can find its value in the 'Running jobs' documentation, section 'Comptes et projets'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `<VERSION>` represent in the VASP job script example?",
    "answer": "`<VERSION>` represents the VASP version number you want to use, such as 4.6, 5.4.1, 5.4.4, or 6.1.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does `<VASP>` represent in the VASP job script example?",
    "answer": "`<VASP>` represents the name of the executable program, which can be chosen from the 'Programmes ex\u00e9cutables' section of the documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are loaded in the example `vasp_job.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The `vasp_job.sh` script loads `intel/2020.1.217`, `intelmpi/2019.7.217`, and `vasp/<VERSION>` modules."
