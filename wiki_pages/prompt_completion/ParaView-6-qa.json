    "question": "What is the first step to compile llvm on a VM for ParaView client-server visualization?",
    "answer": "The first step is to navigate to your home directory, then download the llvm project tarball using `wget https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-21.1.0/LLVM-21.1.0-Linux-X64.tar.xz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "After downloading and unpacking the llvm project, what are the next steps to compile it?",
    "answer": "After downloading and unpacking, you should create a build directory (`mkdir -p build && cd build`), then run `cmake` with specific flags (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, `-DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON`, `-DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON`, `-DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON`, `-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD:STRING=X86`), followed by `make` and `sudo make install`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you compile Mesa with OSMesa support for ParaView on a VM?",
    "answer": "First, navigate to your home directory and download the Mesa tarball using `wget https://archive.mesa3d.org/mesa-25.2.3.tar.xz`. After unpacking, run `./configure` with specific flags to enable OSMesa and SWR drivers, then execute `make` and `sudo make install`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What configuration flags are essential when compiling Mesa for offscreen rendering with OSMesa?",
    "answer": "Essential configuration flags include `--enable-opengl`, `--disable-gles1`, `--disable-gles2`, `--enable-shared-glapi`, `--enable-gallium-llvm`, `--enable-llvm-shared-libs`, `--with-gallium-drivers=swrast,swr`, and importantly `--disable-osmesa --enable-gallium-osmesa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the process for compiling the ParaView server on a VM after llvm and Mesa are compiled?",
    "answer": "First, navigate to your home directory and download the ParaView tarball using `wget https://www.paraview.org/files/v6.0/ParaView-v6.0.0.tar.gz`. After unpacking, create a build directory (`mkdir -p build && cd build`), then run `cmake` with specific flags for offscreen rendering, Python support, and no GUI, followed by `make` and `make install`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which `cmake` flags are necessary when compiling the ParaView server for client-server mode on a VM without a GUI?",
    "answer": "Key `cmake` flags include `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/centos/paraview`, `-DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI=OFF`, `-DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON`, `-DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=OFF`, `-DVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA=ON`, `-DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN=ON`, and `-DVTK_USE_X=OFF`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start the ParaView server on the VM after compilation for SWR rendering?",
    "answer": "To start the ParaView server on the VM with SWR rendering, execute the command: `./paraview/bin/pvserver --force-offscreen-rendering --opengl-window-backend OSMesa`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What SSH command is used on the local computer to create a tunnel to the ParaView server running on a VM?",
    "answer": "You need to organize an SSH tunnel from your local port 11111 to the VM's port 11111 using the command: `ssh centos@vm.ip.address -L 11111:localhost:11111`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you connect the ParaView client on your computer to the server running on the VM after setting up an SSH tunnel?",
    "answer": "Start the ParaView client on your computer and connect to `localhost:11111`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What message indicates a successful connection to the ParaView server with SWR rendering on the VM?",
    "answer": "During rendering in the console, a successful connection with SWR rendering should display the message \"SWR detected AVX2\"."
