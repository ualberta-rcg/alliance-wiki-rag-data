  {
    "question": "What is the first step required to use R on a system?",
    "answer": "You need to begin by loading an R module."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view a list of all available R modules?",
    "answer": "You can see a list of all available R modules using the command `module spider r`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load a specific R module?",
    "answer": "You can load a particular R module using a command like `module load gcc/9.3.0 r/4.0.2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start the R interpreter interactively?",
    "answer": "After loading an R module, you can start the R interpreter by typing `R` in the environment."

  {
    "question": "How do you execute an R script non-interactively?",
    "answer": "To execute an R script non-interactively, use `Rscript` with the file containing the R commands as an argument, for example, `Rscript computation.R`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What options does `Rscript` automatically pass to the R interpreter?",
    "answer": "`Rscript` automatically passes scripting-appropriate options `--slave` and `--no-restore` to the R interpreter, which also imply the `--no-save` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does `Rscript` prevent the creation of workspace files?",
    "answer": "`Rscript` prevents the creation of useless workspace files on exit by implicitly passing the `--no-save` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should R calculations lasting more than two or three minutes be run?",
    "answer": "Calculations lasting more than two or three minutes should not be run on the login node; they should be run via the job scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are R packages from CRAN typically installed?",
    "answer": "Packages from CRAN can be installed using `install.packages` in an interactive R session on a cluster login node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to install R packages in a batch or interactive job on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "No, installing R packages in a batch or interactive job is not possible because compute nodes on most clusters do not have access to the Internet."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended to load before installing R packages, especially those developed with GNU compilers?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to load a `gcc` module before trying to install any R packages, using the same `gcc` version for all packages you install."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you install a specific R package like 'sp' from a CRAN repository?",
    "answer": "On a login node, in an interactive R session, use the command `install.packages('sp', repos='https://cloud.r-project.org/')`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the `repos` argument is not specified when using `install.packages()`?",
