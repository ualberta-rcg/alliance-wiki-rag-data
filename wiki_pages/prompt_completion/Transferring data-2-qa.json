    "question": "What are the main benefits of using Globus for data transfers?",
    "answer": "Globus usually gives the best performance and reliability for data transfers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default behavior when initiating a Globus transfer?",
    "answer": "Normally, a Globus transfer will overwrite files on the destination with files from the source, meaning all files from the source will be transferred."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I make Globus only transfer files that don't match existing files on the destination?",
    "answer": "You should go to the 'Transfer & Timer Options' and choose to 'sync' instead of performing a normal transfer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the slowest but most accurate option for Globus to decide which files to transfer during a sync?",
    "answer": "Choosing to transfer files if 'Their checksums are different' is the slowest option but most accurate, as it catches changes even if file sizes remain the same."
  },
  {
    "question": "When would you use the 'File doesn't exist on destination' option in a Globus sync?",
    "answer": "This option is useful for incrementally creating files, as it will only transfer files that have been created since the last sync."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Globus determine if a file needs to be re-transferred using the 'File size is different' option?",
    "answer": "It performs a quick test: if the file size has changed, its contents must have changed, and it will be re-transferred."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is important to check when depending on 'Modification time is newer' for a Globus transfer?",
    "answer": "It is important to check the 'preserve source file modification times' option when initiating a Globus transfer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Rsync primarily used for?",
    "answer": "Rsync is a popular tool for ensuring that two separate datasets are the same."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what conditions might Rsync be slow?",
    "answer": "Rsync can be quite slow if there are a lot of files or if there is a lot of latency between the two sites (e.g., geographically apart or on different networks)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Rsync typically decide which files to transfer?",
    "answer": "Rsync checks the modification time and size of each file, and only transfers the file if one or both do not match."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Rsync option should be used if modification times are not reliable for syncing between systems?",
    "answer": "You can use the `-c` option, which will compute checksums at the source and destination, and transfer only if the checksums do not match."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should the `-p` and `-g` flags be avoided when using Rsync to transfer files into `/project` file systems?",
    "answer": "These flags should be avoided because `/project` quotas are enforced based on group ownership, and preserving group ownership can lead to 'Disk quota exceeded' errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you correctly use the `rsync -a` (archive) flag when transferring to `/project` file systems to prevent quota issues?",
    "answer": "Since `-a` includes `-p` and `-g` by default, the `--no-g --no-p` options should be added, for example: `rsync -avzh --no-g --no-p LOCALNAME someuser@graham.alliancecan.ca:projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-z` option in Rsync?",
    "answer": "The `-z` option compresses files (excluding those in `--skip-compress` list) but requires additional CPU resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-h` option in Rsync?",
    "answer": "The `-h` option makes transferred file sizes human readable."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Rsync option allows interrupted transfers of very large files to be restarted?",
    "answer": "The `--partial` option allows interrupted transfers to be restarted."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you display the transfer progress of each individual file during an Rsync operation?",
    "answer": "The `--progress` option will display the percent progress of each file as it's transferred."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you display a single progress bar for the entire transfer when using Rsync for many smaller files?",
    "answer": "You can use the `--info=progress2` option to display a single progress bar representing the transfer progress of all files."
