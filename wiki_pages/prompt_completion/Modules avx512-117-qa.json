  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between 'starccm' and 'starccm-mixed'?",
    "answer": "The 'starccm' module uses double precision, while 'starccm-mixed' uses mixed precision for its simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of module is starccm?",
    "answer": "Starccm is a 'phys' type module, indicating it's related to physics simulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the description of the `starccm-mixed` software?",
    "answer": "The `starccm-mixed` software, similar to STAR-CCM+, provides simulation tools for predicting real-world product performance across engineering disciplines, offering accurate and efficient multidisciplinary technologies within a single integrated user interface. This version specifically uses mixed precision."
