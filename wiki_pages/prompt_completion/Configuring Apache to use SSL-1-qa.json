    "question": "What are TLS and SSL?",
    "answer": "Transport Layer Security (TLS) and formerly Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are both often referred to as SSL and allow encrypted communications over computer networks."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to use encryption when sending sensitive information online?",
    "answer": "It is important to use encryption when sending any sensitive information, such as passwords, over the internet."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of encrypting data from a web server even if it's not sensitive?",
    "answer": "Encrypting the data sent from the web server to the client will prevent third parties from intercepting the data and modifying it before it continues on to the client."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it recommended to use SSL certificates?",
    "answer": "In almost all situations, it is a good idea to use SSL certificates to encrypt data transmitted to and from a web server over the internet."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main types of certificates?",
    "answer": "There are two main types of certificates: a certificate signed by a third party signing authority and a self-signed certificate."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which type of certificate is generally preferred for public-facing sites and why?",
    "answer": "In most cases you will want a certificate signed by a third party since it is very easy to do using Let's Encrypt."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what specific cases might a self-signed certificate be used?",
    "answer": "There may be some cases, such as testing, where you may still want to create a self-signed certificate instead."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key drawback of self-signed certificates regarding validity?",
    "answer": "With this method, data sent to and from your web server will be encrypted, however, there is no third party involved vouching for the validity of your web server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What warning do visitors receive when a self-signed certificate is used on a site?",
    "answer": "Visitors to your site will still get a warning about the security of your site."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should self-signed certificates be used for public-facing sites?",
    "answer": "If you have a public-facing site, you probably do not want to use a self-signed certificate."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you check security settings after configuring a web server with a certificate?",
    "answer": "It is a good idea to check the security settings using ssllabs' ssltest tool which can suggest changes to your configuration to improve security."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the benefit of having a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA)?",
    "answer": "Having a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) allows visitors to ensure they are accessing the right website, which avoids man-in-the-middle-attacks."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Certificate Authority does not require a yearly fee?",
    "answer": "Many CAs require a yearly fee, but one which does not is Let's Encrypt CA."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Certbot and what does it do?",
    "answer": "Certbot is a tool that automatically creates or renews an SSL certificate signed by the Let's Encrypt CA and it automatically configures your web server to use the SSL certificate."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can one find information to get started quickly with Certbot?",
    "answer": "The main Certbot page tells you everything you need to know to get started quickly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What port must be opened when configuring Certbot via Apache?",
    "answer": "If you are configuring Certbot via Apache, then you must open port 443 (TCP ingress) in order for Certbot to connect to the site."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Self-signed certificate' section?",
    "answer": "This section describes the procedure for creating a self-signed SSL certificate as opposed to one signed by a CA, and for configuring Apache to use it to encrypt communications."
  },
  {
    "question": "For what types of sites are self-signed certificates useful?",
    "answer": "Self-signed certificates should not be used for production sites, though they may be useful for small locally used sites and for testing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What operating system is assumed for the procedure of creating a self-signed SSL certificate?",
    "answer": "The following steps assume you are using the Ubuntu operating system."
  },
  {
    "question": "If using a Linux operating system other than Ubuntu, will the steps for creating a self-signed certificate be exactly the same?",
    "answer": "If using another Linux operating system, the steps will be similar, but the details will likely be different such as commands and locations and names of configuration files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you activate the SSL module for Apache?",
    "answer": "Once Apache has been installed, the SSL module must be enabled with `sudo a2enmod ssl` and `sudo service apache2 restart`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to create a self-signed SSL certificate?",
    "answer": "To create a self-signed SSL certificate, use the command `sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/server.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does it indicate if you are asked for a pass phrase when creating a self-signed SSL certificate?",
    "answer": "If you are asked for a pass phrase, it likely means that you missed the `-node` option."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which question is most important to answer when creating a self-signed SSL certificate?",
    "answer": "The most important question to answer is the 'Common Name' question which should be the domain name of your server."
  },
  {
    "question": "For a virtual machine on the clouds, what should the 'Common Name' be when creating a self-signed certificate?",
    "answer": "For a virtual machine on our clouds, the 'Common Name' should look similar to the example response, but the string of Xs should be replaced with the floating IP associated with the virtual machine."
