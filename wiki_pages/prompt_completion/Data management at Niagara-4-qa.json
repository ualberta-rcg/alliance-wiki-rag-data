  {
    "question": "What are the default file permissions for users within the same group at SciNet?",
    "answer": "By default, users within the same group have read permission to each other's files (not write)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of Access Control Lists (ACLs)?",
    "answer": "ACLs can be used to allow a supervisor or another user within your group to manage files (create, move, rename, delete) while retaining original access and permission, or to grant access (read, execute) to users in other groups."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which GPFS native commands are used for managing ACLs?",
    "answer": "You can use GPFS' native `mmputacl` and `mmgetacl` commands."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the advantages of using `mmputacl` and `mmgetacl` for ACL management?",
    "answer": "The advantages are that you can set 'control' permission and that POSIX or NFS v4 style ACLs are supported."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you apply ACLs to a directory using `mmputacl`?",
    "answer": "First, create a `/tmp/supervisor.acl` file with the desired ACL contents, then issue `mmputacl -i /tmp/supervisor.acl /project/g/group/[owner]` and `mmputacl -d -i /tmp/supervisor.acl /project/g/group/[owner]`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you determine the current ACL attributes of a directory?",
    "answer": "Use the command `mmgetacl /project/g/group/[owner]`."

  {
    "question": "How can you remove a previously set ACL?",
    "answer": "You can remove a previously set ACL using `mmdelacl -d /project/g/group/[owner]`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create or change a GPFS access control list interactively?",
    "answer": "Use the command `mmeditacl /project/g/group/[owner]`, but first set the EDITOR environment variable, for example: `export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vi`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a built-in GPFS command to recursively add or remove ACL attributes to existing files?",
    "answer": "No, there is no option to recursively add or remove ACL attributes using a GPFS built-in command to existing files; you'll need to use the `-i` option for each file or directory individually, or use a sample bash script."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the simple way to give read-write-execute (rwx) permissions to everyone in your group?",
    "answer": "You should simply rely on the plain Unix `chmod g+rwx` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can ACLs be used to grant permissions to files or directories that you do not own?",
    "answer": "No, ACLs won't let you give away permissions to files or directories that do not belong to you."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it strongly advised not to grant write permission to other users on the top level of your home directory?",
    "answer": "Giving write permission to other users on the top level of your home directory (/home/G/GROUP/[owner]) would seriously compromise your privacy and disable SSH key authentication."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which ACL commands should be used on Niagara for GPFS filesystems?",
    "answer": "On Niagara, you must use the `mm*` commands for GPFS: `mmputacl`, `mmgetacl`, `mmdelacl`, `mmeditacl`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can a sample bash script for recursive ACL management be found?",
    "answer": "A sample bash script for recursively adding or removing ACL attributes using GPFS built-in commands can be found at [https://docs.scinet.utoronto.ca/index.php/Recursive_ACL_script]."
