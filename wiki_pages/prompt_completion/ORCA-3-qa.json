  {
    "question": "How can NBO be accessed on the clusters for use with ORCA?",
    "answer": "NBO is not available as a separate module, but it can be accessed via the Gaussian modules which are installed on Cedar and Graham clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which clusters have Gaussian modules available to access NBO for ORCA?",
    "answer": "Gaussian modules, which provide access to NBO for ORCA, are installed on Cedar and Graham clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find information on getting access to Gaussian?",
    "answer": "You can follow the steps discussed in the [[Gaussian#License_agreement|page]] to get access to Gaussian."
  },
  {
    "question": "What keyword should be included in the ORCA input file when using NBO?",
    "answer": "The ORCA input file, such as `orca_input.inp`, should contain the keyword 'NBO'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are loaded in the example script for running ORCA with NBO?",
    "answer": "The example script loads `StdEnv/2020`, `gcc/10.3.0`, `openmpi/4.1.1`, `orca/5.0.4`, and `gaussian/g16.c01` modules."

  {
    "question": "How are the `GENEXE` and `NBOEXE` environment variables set in the NBO script example?",
    "answer": "The `GENEXE` variable is set using `export GENEXE=`which gennbo.i4.exe`` and `NBOEXE` is set using `export NBOEXE=`which nbo7.i4.exe``."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is ORCA executed in the example job script for NBO calculations?",
    "answer": "ORCA is executed by `${EBROOTORCA}/orca orca_input.inp > orca_output.out`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What related links are provided for ORCA?",
    "answer": "Related links include the ORCA tutorials at https://www.orcasoftware.de/tutorials_orca/ and the ORCA Forum at https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal."
