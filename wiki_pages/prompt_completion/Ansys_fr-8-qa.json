  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the Fluent solution restart scripts?",
    "answer": "The Fluent solution restart scripts automate the restarting of intensive tasks that require more than the maximum allowed execution time on most clusters, by restarting from the most recently saved time step files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What files are required to start a Fluent simulation with the restart script?",
    "answer": "To start a Fluent simulation with the restart script, a group of `sample.cas`, `sample.dat`, and `sample.jou` files must be present."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the `sample.jou` file be modified for use with the restart scripts?",
    "answer": "The `sample.jou` file should be modified to contain `/solve/dual-time-iterate 1` and `/file/auto-save/data-frequency 1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create and modify the `sample-restart.jou` file for solution restarts?",
    "answer": "First, create `sample-restart.jou` by copying `sample.jou`. Then, modify `sample-restart.jou` to contain `/file/read-cas-data sample-restart` instead of `/file/read-cas-data sample` and comment out the initialization line (e.g., `;/solve/initialize/initialize-flow`). If subsequent steps are twice as fast, change `/solve/dual-time-iterate` to `2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Slurm parameter is used to specify the number of solution restarts in the provided scripts?",
    "answer": "The Slurm parameter `--array=1-5%1` is used to specify the number of solution restarts, with `1-5%1` indicating 5 restart attempts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum time limit that can be specified for a Fluent restart job on most clusters?",
    "answer": "The maximum time limit that can be specified for a Fluent restart job is `07-00:00` days."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Ansys module version is loaded in the example Fluent restart scripts for StdEnv/2023?",
    "answer": "The example Fluent restart scripts load `ansys/2023R2` or newer versions for StdEnv/2023."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are journal files used in Fluent simulations?",
    "answer": "Journal files can contain all Fluent TUI (Text User Interface) commands, allowing users to modify simulation parameters like temperature, pressure, or flow velocity, and perform a series of simulations under different conditions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more information about Fluent commands for journal files?",
    "answer": "Users can consult the Fluent user guide for more information and a list of commands."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to configure Fluent to use the older .cas/.dat file formats?",
    "answer": "To configure Fluent to use the older .cas/.dat file formats, the command `/file/cff-files no` is used in the journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure Fluent to use the more efficient .cas.h5/.dat.h5 file formats?",
    "answer": "To configure Fluent to use the more efficient .cas.h5/.dat.h5 file formats (available from versions 2020R1), the command `/file/cff-files yes` should be used in the journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `auto-save/data-frequency` command do in a Fluent journal file?",
    "answer": "The `auto-save/data-frequency` command specifies how often data files are saved, for example, `100` to save every 100 iterations or time steps."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can Fluent be configured to retain only the most recent auto-saved data files?",
    "answer": "Fluent can be configured to retain only the most recent auto-saved data files by adding `/file/auto-save/retain-most-recent-files y` to the journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a Fluent transient simulation journal file, what command sets the physical time step size?",
    "answer": "The command `/solve/set/time-step 0.0001` sets the physical time step size in a Fluent transient simulation journal file."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one use the restart scripts to perform a variable number of solution steps instead of fixed time steps?",
    "answer": "By setting `/solve/dual-time-iterate 1` in `sample.jou` and if the first and subsequent steps require similar execution times, then `1` should be chosen for the `dual-time-iterate` value in `sample-restart.jou` as well. The total duration of the simulation will be `1*Dt + Nrestart*Dt` where `Nrestart` is defined in the Slurm script."
