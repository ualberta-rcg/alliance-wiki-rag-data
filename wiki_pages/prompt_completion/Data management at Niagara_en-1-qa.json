  {
    "question": "What type of high-performance filesystem is used on SciNet, excluding /archive?",
    "answer": "The filesystems on SciNet, with the exception of /archive, are GPFS (IBM General Parallel File System)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the GPFS filesystem perform when accessing many small files?",
    "answer": "The GPFS filesystem performs quite poorly at accessing data sets which consist of many, small files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the block size for the scratch and project filesystems?",
    "answer": "The blocksize for the scratch and project filesystems is 16MB."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it inefficient for multi-process jobs to have each process write to its own file?",
    "answer": "It is not a scalable I/O solution because a directory gets locked by the first process accessing it, causing other processes to wait, and can lead to filesystem timeouts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended solutions for I/O in multi-process jobs on SciNet?",
    "answer": "Consider using MPI-IO, which allows files to be opened simultaneously by different processes, or a dedicated process for I/O to which all other processes send their data for writing to a single file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the /home filesystem?",
    "answer": "/home is intended primarily for individual user files, common software, or small datasets used by others in the same group, provided they do not exceed individual quotas."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the /home filesystem accessible on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "/home is read-only on the compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the intended use for the /scratch filesystem?",
    "answer": "/scratch is primarily for temporary or transient files, results of computations and simulations, or any material that can be easily recreated or reacquired."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should one consider using the burst buffer (/bb) instead of /scratch?",
    "answer": "You should consider the burst buffer if your workflow induces too much I/O or too many small files on /scratch."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are files on /scratch backed up?",
    "answer": "No, /scratch has no backups."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is /scratch purged regularly?",
    "answer": "Yes, /scratch is purged on a regular basis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of data is typically stored on the /project filesystem?",
    "answer": "/project is intended for common group software, large static datasets, or any material very costly to be reacquired or re-generated by the group."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the expectation regarding the mutability of material on /project?",
    "answer": "Material on /project is expected to remain relatively immutable over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should temporary files not be kept on /project?",
    "answer": "Temporary or transient files should not be kept on /project because high data turnover induces stress and unnecessary consumption of tapes on the TSM backup system due to backup retention policies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a user renames top directories on /project?",
    "answer": "Renaming top directories is enough to trick the system into assuming a completely new directory tree has been created and the old one deleted, which impacts backup systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can access /project on Niagara?",
    "answer": "On Niagara, /project is only available to groups with RAC (Resource Allocation Competition) allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is /bb?",
    "answer": "/bb, also known as the Burst Buffer, is a very fast, very high-performance alternative to /scratch, made of solid-state drives (SSD)."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should a user request the Burst Buffer (/bb)?",
    "answer": "Users may request the Burst Buffer if they anticipate a lot of IOPs (Input/Output Operations) or when their job is performing poorly on scratch or project due to I/O bottlenecks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the /archive filesystem?",
    "answer": "/archive is a nearline storage pool used to temporarily offload semi-active material from other filesystems, typically when users hit quotas or as part of their workflow."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long can material remain on HPSS (the /archive storage pool)?",
    "answer": "That material can remain on HPSS for a few months to a few years."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can access /archive on Niagara?",
    "answer": "On Niagara, /archive is only available to groups with RAC (Resource Allocation Competition) allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is /dev/shm on Niagara nodes?",
    "answer": "/dev/shm is a ramdisk available on the Niagara nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the performance of ramdisk compare to real disk and Burst Buffer?",
    "answer": "Ramdisk is much faster than real disk and faster than Burst Buffer."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much RAM can be used as a temporary local filesystem via /dev/shm?",
    "answer": "Up to 70 percent of the RAM on the node (i.e., 202GB) may be used as a temporary local filesystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is /dev/shm particularly useful for HPC applications with high file I/O?",
    "answer": "It's useful because it's a local filesystem, which is much faster than real disk and avoids the synchronization bottleneck common on parallel filesystems like GPFS."
