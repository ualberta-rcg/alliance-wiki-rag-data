  },
  {
    "question": "How is CUDA handled with OpenMPI in `StdEnv/2023`?",
    "answer": "In `StdEnv/2023`, CUDA becomes an add-on to OpenMPI, meaning CUDA-aware MPI is loaded at run time if CUDA is loaded. This allows sharing MPI libraries across CUDA and non-CUDA branches."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were the default version upgrades for core modules in `StdEnv/2023`?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the support status of `StdEnv/2020`?",
    "answer": "`StdEnv/2020` is deprecated and no longer supported on newer systems, although CPU-only software will run fine."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did `StdEnv/2020` become the default software environment?",
    "answer": "`StdEnv/2020` became the default software environment in April 2021."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default components for `StdEnv/2020`?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How do I activate the `StdEnv/2020` environment?",
    "answer": "To activate this environment, use the command `module load StdEnv/2020`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What performance improvement did `StdEnv/2020` introduce for binaries compiled with the Intel compiler?",
    "answer": "In `StdEnv/2020`, binaries compiled with the Intel compiler now automatically support both AVX2 and AVX512 instruction sets, also known as multi-architecture or fat binaries."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did `StdEnv/2020` improve the visibility of certain software packages like bioinformatics and R modules?",
    "answer": "Many software packages that were previously installed either with GCC or Intel are now installed at a lower level of the software hierarchy in `StdEnv/2020`, making the same module visible irrespective of which compiler is loaded."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the change in the compatibility layer for the 2020 release compared to earlier versions?",
    "answer": "For the 2020 release, the compatibility layer used Gentoo Prefix, whereas for versions 2016.4 and 2018.3, the Nix package manager was used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the kernel requirement for `StdEnv/2020`?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How did `StdEnv/2020` handle Python module extensions?",
    "answer": "With `StdEnv/2020`, more Python extensions, such as `PyQt5`, started being installed inside their corresponding core modules (e.g., `qt/5.12.8`) to support multiple versions of Python."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you find Python module extensions, such as `PyQt5`, in the `StdEnv/2020` environment?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `module spider pyqt5`, which would tell you to load the `qt/5.12.8` module to get it."
