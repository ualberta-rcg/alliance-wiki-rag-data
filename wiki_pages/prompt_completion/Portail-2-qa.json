    "question": "What information is displayed at the top of a CPU task page?",
    "answer": "At the top of a CPU task page, you will find the task name, its number, your username, and its status."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I view the submission script details for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "You can view the details of your submission script by clicking on 'Voir le script de la t\u00e2che'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what condition will the submission script not be available for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "If the task was launched in interactive mode, the submission script will not be available."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I access the working directory and submission command for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "The working directory and submission command can be accessed by clicking on 'Voir la commande de soumission'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is provided in the scheduler section for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "This section is dedicated to scheduler information, and you can access your CPU account tracking page by clicking on your account number."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can I find in the 'Ressources' section of a CPU task page?",
    "answer": "The 'Ressources' section provides an initial overview of your task's resource utilization by comparing the 'Allou\u00e9s' (Allocated) and 'Utilis\u00e9s' (Used) columns for various listed parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the CPU graph on a CPU task page show?",
    "answer": "The CPU graph allows you to visualize the CPU cores you have requested over time. You can also select or deselect different cores as needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the CPU graph not available for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "The CPU graph is not available for very short tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the Memory graph display for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "The Memory graph visualizes the utilization of the memory you have requested over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information can be found in the 'Process and threads' graph for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "The 'Process and threads' graph allows you to observe various parameters related to processes and execution threads, including running threads, sleeping threads, and program applications executed over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal combined value for 'Running threads' and 'Sleeping threads' in a multithreaded CPU task?",
    "answer": "Ideally, for a multithreaded task, the sum of 'Running threads' and 'Sleeping threads' should not exceed twice the number of requested cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it normal to have 'Sleeping threads' for certain programs?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is entirely normal to have some processes in 'dormant' (Sleeping threads) mode for certain types of programs like Java, Matlab, commercial software, or complex programs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the file system utilization graphs for a CPU task show?",
    "answer": "The left graph shows the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS), and the right graph illustrates the data transfer rate between the task and the file system over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the file system utilization graphs for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "These graphs help identify periods of intense activity or low utilization of the file system by the task."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might node-level resource statistics be imprecise for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "Node-level resource statistics can be imprecise if the node is shared among several users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the full node resource graphs illustrate for a CPU task?",
    "answer": "The left graph illustrates the evolution of bandwidth used by the task over time, in relation to software and licenses. The right graph represents the evolution of network bandwidth used by a task or set of tasks via the Infiniband network, allowing observation of periods of massive data transfer (e.g., read/write on a Lustre file system, MPI communication between nodes)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the local disk IOPS and bandwidth graphs for a CPU task display?",
    "answer": "The left graph shows the evolution of Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) performed on the local disk over time. The right graph shows the evolution of bandwidth used on the local disk over time, representing the quantity of data read or written per second."
