    "question": "What are the general steps to prepare and use a newly created volume on most Linux distributions?",
    "answer": "On most Linux distributions, the general steps are to partition, format, and then mount the newly created volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done if a volume is not newly created and already contains data?",
    "answer": "If a volume is not newly created, the partition and format steps should be skipped as they will result in loss of data; only the steps to mount the volume should be followed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create a partition on a volume using the `fdisk` command?",
    "answer": "To create a partition, run `sudo fdisk /dev/vdb` and use the following sequence of commands: `n` (new partition), `p` (primary), `1` (partition number 1), `<return>` (first sector), `<return>` (last sector), and `w` (write partition table to disk and exit)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to format a newly created partition with the `ext4` filesystem?",
    "answer": "The command `sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vdb1` is used to format the newly created partition with `ext4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create a directory to serve as a mount point for a device?",
    "answer": "A directory to mount the device can be created with the command `sudo mkdir /media/data`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to manually mount a volume to a specific directory?",
    "answer": "To mount the volume, use the command `sudo mount /dev/vdb1 /media/data`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a VM be configured to mount a volume automatically at boot time?",
    "answer": "To cause the VM to mount the volume automatically at boot time, edit `/etc/fstab` and add a line like `/dev/vdb1 /media/data ext4 defaults 0 2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "If `/etc/fstab` has been updated but the VM has not been rebooted, how can the newly added device be mounted immediately?",
    "answer": "If you are not rebooting, you can mount the device just added to `/etc/fstab` with the command `sudo mount -a`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to unmount a volume before detaching it?",
    "answer": "Unmounting a volume before detaching it helps prevent data corruption."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to unmount a mounted volume?",
    "answer": "To unmount a previously mounted volume, use the command `sudo umount /media/data`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances will the `umount` command fail?",
    "answer": "The `umount` command will fail if any files are being accessed (either reading or writing) by the operating system or any other program running on the VM, resulting in a 'volume is still busy' message."
