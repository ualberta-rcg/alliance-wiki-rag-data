    "question": "What is the importance of understanding filesystems on SciNet?",
    "answer": "Understanding the various filesystems and how to use them properly is critical to optimizing your workflow and being a good SciNet citizen."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which filesystem type do SciNet systems use, excluding /archive?",
    "answer": "The filesystems on SciNet, with the exception of /archive, are GPFS (IBM General Parallel File System)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the GPFS filesystem on SciNet perform with large datasets?",
    "answer": "GPFS is a high-performance filesystem which provides rapid reads and writes to large datasets in parallel from many nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the SciNet filesystem perform when accessing many small files?",
    "answer": "The filesystem performs quite poorly at accessing data sets which consist of many, small files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the blocksize for the scratch and project filesystems?",
    "answer": "The blocksize for the scratch and project filesystems is 16MB."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is writing individual files per process not a scalable I/O solution for multi-process jobs?",
    "answer": "A directory gets locked by the first process accessing it, forcing other processes to wait, which can lead to the filesystem timing out and the program crashing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are recommended I/O strategies for multi-process jobs to improve scalability?",
    "answer": "Consider using MPI-IO, which allows files to be opened simultaneously by different processes, or a dedicated I/O process that collects data from all other processes and writes it to a single file."

  {
    "question": "Are all filesystems on Niagara available to every user?",
    "answer": "No, not all of the filesystems on Niagara are available to all users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the /home ($HOME) filesystem?",
    "answer": "/home is intended primarily for individual user files, common software, or small datasets used by others in the same group, provided it does not exceed individual quotas."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the access status of the /home filesystem on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "/home is read-only on the compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main use of the /scratch ($SCRATCH) filesystem?",
    "answer": "/scratch is to be used primarily for temporary or transient files, results of computations and simulations, or any material that can be easily recreated or reacquired."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should you consider using the burst buffer (/bb) instead of /scratch?",
    "answer": "You should consider the burst buffer (/bb) if your workflow on /scratch induces too much I/O or too many small files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be done with long-term results stored on /scratch?",
    "answer": "Once you have your final results that you want to keep for the long term, you should migrate them to /project or /archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the /scratch filesystem have backups?",
    "answer": "No, /scratch has no backups."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the /scratch filesystem purged?",
    "answer": "Yes, /scratch is purged on a regular basis."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the intended use for the /project ($PROJECT) filesystem?",
    "answer": "/project is intended for common group software, large static datasets, or any material very costly to be reacquired or re-generated by the group."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the expectation for material stored on /project regarding its mutability?",
    "answer": "Material on /project is expected to remain relatively immutable over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should temporary files not be kept on /project?",
    "answer": "Temporary or transient files should be kept on scratch, not project, because high data turnover induces stress and unnecessary consumption tapes on the TSM backup system."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required for groups to access /project on Niagara?",
    "answer": "On Niagara, /project is only available to groups with RAC allocation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Burst Buffer (/bb) and what is it made of?",
    "answer": "The Burst Buffer (/bb) is a very fast, very high performance alternative to /scratch, made of solid-state drives (SSD)."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it advisable to request the Burst Buffer (/bb) resource?",
    "answer": "You may request the Burst Buffer resource if you anticipate a lot of IOPs (Input/Output Operations) or when your job is not performing well on /scratch or /project because of I/O bottlenecks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the /archive ($ARCHIVE) filesystem?",
    "answer": "/archive is a 'nearline' storage pool for temporarily offloading semi-active material from other filesystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long can material typically remain on HPSS, which is used for /archive?",
    "answer": "Material can remain on HPSS for a few months to a few years."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can use the /archive filesystem on Niagara?",
    "answer": "On Niagara, /archive is only available to groups with RAC allocation."
