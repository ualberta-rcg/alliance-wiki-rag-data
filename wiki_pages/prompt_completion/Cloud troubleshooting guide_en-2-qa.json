    "question": "How can I investigate why my VM was taken out of the running state if it's not 'Running'?",

  {
    "question": "If my VM is running but I can't reach an application or web service on it, what connection method should I try?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What are the default usernames for SSH connections based on the VM's operating system?",
    "answer": "The default usernames are 'debian' for Debian, 'ubuntu' for Ubuntu, 'centos' for CentOS, and 'fedora' for Fedora. If you changed your username with a custom CloudInit script, use the username you set."
