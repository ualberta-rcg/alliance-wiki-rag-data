    "question": "What is SSH?",
    "answer": "SSH is a software protocol used to connect to clusters. It protects communication security by verifying the server\u2019s identity and yours against known identification data, and by encrypting the connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are changes being made to SSH options?",
    "answer": "Changes are being made because security risks evolve over time, leading to the end of support for certain SSH options which are no longer deemed secure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do users need to do to continue using the clusters after the SSH changes?",
    "answer": "Users will have to make some changes on their part to continue using the clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "When were the SSH security improvements implemented?",
    "answer": "The SSH security improvements were implemented on September 24, 2019, on Graham, and one week later on B\u00e9luga and Cedar."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific SSH security improvements have been implemented?",
    "answer": "The implemented improvements include disabling certain encryption algorithms, disabling certain public key types, and regenerating the cluster's host keys."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should users do if they don't understand 'encryption algorithms', 'public keys', or 'host keys'?",
    "answer": "Users should simply follow the steps outlined in the document, and if testing indicates a need to update or change their SSH client, the 'SSH page' may be useful."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do these SSH changes affect users connecting to Arbutus?",
    "answer": "No, the upcoming changes do not concern users of Arbutus because they connect via a web interface, not SSH."
  },
  {
    "question": "Were there any earlier, less comprehensive SSH updates before September 2019?",
    "answer": "Yes, earlier updates were made to Niagara on May 31, 2019, and to Graham in early August, which might have triggered similar messages and errors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What warning message might users see the first time they log in to a cluster after the changes?",
    "answer": "Users will probably see a warning message like 'WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the 'REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!' warning displayed?",
    "answer": "This warning is displayed because the host keys on the cluster were changed, and the SSH client software remembers the old host keys to prevent 'man-in-the-middle' attacks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of an SSH client remembering old host keys?",
    "answer": "An SSH client remembers old host keys to prevent 'man-in-the-middle' attacks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What other related warning might users receive?",
    "answer": "Users may also get a warning regarding 'DNS spoofing', which is related to the same host key change."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should users handle host key warnings when using MobaXterm, PuTTY, or WinSCP on Windows?",
    "answer": "The warning will appear in a pop-up window, allowing users to accept the new host key by clicking 'Yes', but only if the fingerprint matches one listed in the 'SSH host key fingerprints'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should users do if the host key fingerprint displayed in MobaXterm, PuTTY, or WinSCP does not match the list?",
    "answer": "If the fingerprint does not match any on the list, users should not accept the connection and must contact technical support with the details."
  },
  {
    "question": "When were users notified about the SSH changes?",
    "answer": "Emails explaining these changes were sent to all users on July 29, and with more detail on September 16."
