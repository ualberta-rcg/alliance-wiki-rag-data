    "question": "How can I extract multiple files from a tar archive using wildcards?",
    "answer": "You can extract files using the `--wildcards` option with `tar -xvf`. For example, `tar -C ./new_results/ -xvf results.tar --wildcards \"results/log*\"` would extract all files starting with \"log\" from the \"results\" directory within the archive to the `new_results` directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you list the contents of a tar file without decompressing it?",
    "answer": "You can list the contents of a tar file using the `tar -t` command. For example, `tar -tf results.tar` will display the list of files and directories within the archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I see detailed metadata, such as permissions and modification dates, when listing the contents of a tar file?",
    "answer": "To view metadata like permissions, modification date, and owner, add the `-v` (verbose) option to the list command: `tar -tvf results.tar`. This provides output similar to `ls -l`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I count the number of entries (files and directories) in a tar archive?",
    "answer": "You can count the number of entries by piping the output of `tar -tf results.tar` or `tar -tvf results.tar` to `wc -l`. For example, `tar -tf results.tar | wc -l` will return the total count."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the long-form equivalents for the `tar` options `-t`, `-v`, and `-f`?",
    "answer": "The option `-t` is equivalent to `--list`, `-v` to `--verbose`, and `-f` to `--file=`. For instance, `-tvf` is equivalent to `-t -v -f`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an important rule to remember about the `-f` or `--file=` option when using `tar`?",
    "answer": "The `-f` or `--file=` option must always precede the name of the tar archive file in the command."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I search for a specific file within a tar archive without extracting its entire content?",
    "answer": "You can list the archive's contents and pipe the output to the `grep` command. For example, to find 'log.15Feb16.4', use `tar -tf results.tar | grep -a log.15Feb16.4`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I search for files matching a pattern, like those starting with 'log', inside a tar archive without decompressing it?",
    "answer": "To search for files matching a pattern, such as those starting with 'log', within an archive, you can use `tar -tf your_archive.tar | grep -a log*`. Adding `-v` to `tar` will show more details for the matched files."
