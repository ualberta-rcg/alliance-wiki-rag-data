    "question": "What is the real duration per step for a simulation using 1 core according to the CPU benchmarking data?",
    "answer": "The real duration per step is 0.8313 for a simulation using 1 core."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the efficiency when running a simulation with 16 CPU cores?",
    "answer": "The efficiency when running a simulation with 16 CPU cores is 104%."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many CPU cores are considered acceptable for system simulation based on the provided benchmarking results?",
    "answer": "It is acceptable to use 256 cores for system simulation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the consequence of requesting more CPU cores than necessary for a task?",
    "answer": "If you request more CPU cores than necessary, your tasks will experience longer waiting times, and your overall result could be negatively affected."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD module is used for GPU simulations on a single node?",
    "answer": "The NAMD multicore module is used for GPU simulations that can be performed with a single node."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD module is used for GPU simulations requiring multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "The NAMD verbs-smp module is used for GPU simulations that require multiple nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the GPU benchmarking, what is the real duration per step when using 4 cores and 1 GPU on a single node?",
    "answer": "The real duration per step is 0.0165 when using 4 cores and 1 GPU on a single node."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the optimal GPU configuration for maximum efficiency on a single node?",
    "answer": "For maximum efficiency on a single node, it is preferable to use 1 GPU with 16 cores."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it acceptable to use 2 GPUs with 32 cores on a single node?",
    "answer": "The use of 2 GPUs with 32 cores on a single node is acceptable if you need to produce your results quickly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it beneficial to use more than one node for GPU tasks with NAMD?",
    "answer": "No, it is absolutely useless to use more than one node for GPU tasks with NAMD, as performance decreases with two or more nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is using GPU nodes generally more economical on the Graham cluster?",
    "answer": "Using GPU nodes on Graham is generally more economical because, despite being nearly twice as expensive, they process tasks faster than non-GPU nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances should one consider not using a GPU despite its performance benefits?",
    "answer": "One should consider not using a GPU if the wait time for GPU nodes is too long, as CPU nodes are more numerous."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is NAMD 3?",
    "answer": "NAMD 3 is a version of the software available in a module, which may offer better performance compared to NAMD 2.14 for certain system configurations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user immediately try NAMD 3?",
    "answer": "To try NAMD 3 immediately, a user can download the binary from the NAMD website, extract it, navigate into the directory, and then run `setrpaths.sh --path .`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended to improve NAMD 3 GPU performance?",
    "answer": "To obtain better performance with NAMD 3 on a GPU, it is strongly recommended to add the keyword `GPUresident on;` to the configuration file, provided the input configuration allows it."
