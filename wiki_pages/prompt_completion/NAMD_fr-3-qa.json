    "question": "Based on the CPU benchmarking results, what is considered an acceptable number of cores to use for simulating the system?",
    "answer": "It is acceptable to use up to 256 cores for simulating the system according to the CPU benchmarking data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the consequence of requesting more CPU cores than necessary for a NAMD simulation?",
    "answer": "If you request more CPU cores than needed, your tasks will experience longer waiting times, which can negatively affect your overall results."
  },
  {
    "question": "When performing GPU benchmarking, which NAMD module is used for simulations on a single node?",
    "answer": "For NAMD simulations on a single node with GPU, the multicore module is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which NAMD module is used for GPU tasks requiring multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "For GPU tasks requiring multiple nodes, the verbs-smp module is used."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the GPU benchmarking table, what is the recommended maximum number of nodes to use for NAMD tasks to maintain performance?",
    "answer": "The data indicates that it is absolutely unnecessary to use more than one node, as performance decreases with two or more nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "For a single-node NAMD GPU simulation, what configuration of GPUs and cores offers the maximum efficiency?",
    "answer": "With a single node, using 1 GPU/16 cores offers maximum efficiency."
  },
  {
    "question": "What GPU/core configuration is acceptable on a single node if quick results are a priority, even if not maximally efficient?",
    "answer": "The use of 2 GPUs/32 cores on a single node is acceptable if quick results are needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "On Graham's GPU nodes, is there any performance advantage to using 4 or 8 cores with a single GPU for NAMD tasks?",
    "answer": "No, there is no advantage to using 4 or 8 cores with a single GPU, as the priority order is the same for all 1 GPU/16 cores tasks on Graham's GPU nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it more economical to use GPU nodes or non-GPU nodes on Graham for NAMD simulations?",
    "answer": "It is more economical to use GPU nodes on Graham, as a GPU node (2 GPU/32 cores) processes the task faster than 4 non-GPU nodes, even though it costs nearly twice as much."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what circumstances should one consider not using GPUs for NAMD simulations, despite their performance and economic benefits?",
    "answer": "You should consider not using GPUs if the waiting time for GPU nodes becomes too long, as CPU nodes are more numerous."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is NAMD 3 available as a module, and how does its performance compare to NAMD 2.14?",
    "answer": "Yes, NAMD 3 is available in a module, and for certain system configurations, its performance could be better compared to NAMD 2.14."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a user immediately try NAMD 3 if they don't want to wait for module updates?",
    "answer": "To try NAMD 3 immediately, you can download the binary from the NAMD website, extract it, navigate to its directory, and then use `setrpaths.sh --path .` to link it to appropriate libraries."
  },
  {
    "question": "What key parameter is strongly recommended to add to the configuration file for better NAMD 3 performance on a GPU?",
    "answer": "For better NAMD 3 performance on a GPU, it is strongly recommended to add the keyword `GPUresident on;` to your configuration file, provided your input configuration allows it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more information about the `GPUresident on;` parameter for NAMD 3?",
    "answer": "More information on the `GPUresident on;` parameter and its changes can be found on this page: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/alpha/3.0alpha/"
