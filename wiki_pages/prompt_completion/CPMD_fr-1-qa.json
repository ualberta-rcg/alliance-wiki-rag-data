  {
    "question": "What is CPMD?",
    "answer": "CPMD is an ab initio molecular dynamics simulation program based on density functional theory (DFT) for plane waves/pseudo-potentials."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is registration required to use CPMD on the clusters?",
    "answer": "Registration is no longer necessary, but the modules installed on our clusters are protected by a POSIX group."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I get access to use CPMD on the clusters?",
    "answer": "To use CPMD on our clusters, you need to write to technical support (soutien technique) to be added to the POSIX group."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules need to be loaded to use CPMD?",
    "answer": "You need to load 'StdEnv/2020' and 'intel/2020.1.217 openmpi/4.0.3 cpmd/4.3'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long might it take to get a response from CPMD administrators regarding local installation?",
    "answer": "The response from CPMD administrators can take a few weeks or even a few months."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can a registered user install CPMD locally?",
    "answer": "A registered user can build the application in their /home directory using the EasyBuild environment and the same recipe used for a central installation, as they have access to the CPMD source files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step to install CPMD 4.3 locally on a cluster account?",
    "answer": "First, create a local directory by running 'mkdir -p ~/.local/easybuild/sources/c/CPMD'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What files are needed for a local CPMD 4.3 installation using EasyBuild?",
    "answer": "The tarballs and patches needed include cpmd2cube.tar.gz, cpmd2xyz-scripts.tar.gz, cpmd-v4.3.tar.gz, fourier.tar.gz, and several patch files (patch.to.4612, patch.to.4615, etc.)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you execute the EasyBuild command for a local CPMD 4.3 installation?",
    "answer": "You run the command 'eb CPMD-4.3-iomkl-2020a.eb --rebuild'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the '--rebuild' option do in the EasyBuild command?",
    "answer": "The '--rebuild' option ensures that EasyBuild uses the installation located in your /home directory instead of the central one."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should you do after CPMD has been installed locally?",
    "answer": "After the application is installed, you should log out of the cluster and log back in again."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you verify that the locally installed CPMD executable is being used?",
    "answer": "After loading the necessary modules, run 'which cpmd.x' and it should point to '~/.local/easybuild/software/2020/avx2/MPI/intel2020/openmpi4/cpmd/4.3/bin/cpmd.x'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to run a CPMD task?",
    "answer": "To execute a task, you must configure an input file and ensure access to pseudo-potentials."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run CPMD in parallel if the input file and pseudo-potentials are in the same directory?",
    "answer": "Use the command 'srun cpmd.x <input files> > <output file>'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you run CPMD if the pseudo-potentials are in a different directory than the input file?",
    "answer": "Use the command 'srun cpmd.x <input files> <path to pseudo potentials location> > <output file>'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of calculation is described in the example input file '1-h2-wave.inp'?",
    "answer": "The example input file describes a single point calculation for an isolated hydrogen molecule."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the cutoff value set in the example CPMD input file?",
    "answer": "The CUTOFF value is set to 70.0 in the example input file."
