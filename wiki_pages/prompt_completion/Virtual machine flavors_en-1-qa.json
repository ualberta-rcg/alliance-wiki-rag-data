    "question": "What are 'flavors' in OpenStack?",
    "answer": "In OpenStack, 'flavors' are virtual hardware templates that define sizes for RAM, disk, number of cores, and other parameters, giving users choices for virtual machine configurations similar to purchasing physical servers."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can researchers view the flavors allocated to their project?",
    "answer": "Researchers can view their allocated flavors in the Horizon Dashboard or via the OpenStack command line client."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to list OpenStack flavors and sort them by RAM?",
    "answer": "The command to list OpenStack flavors sorted by RAM is 'openstack flavor list --sort-column RAM'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should a user do if they need an OpenStack flavor that is not currently allocated to their project?",
    "answer": "If a user has a project and needs a flavor not currently allocated, they should email cloud@tech.alliancecan.ca."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the prefix 'c' designate in an OpenStack virtual machine flavor name?",
    "answer": "The prefix 'c' designates 'compute' in an OpenStack virtual machine flavor name."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the prefix 'p' designate in an OpenStack virtual machine flavor name?",
    "answer": "The prefix 'p' designates 'persistent' in an OpenStack virtual machine flavor name."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the prefix 'g' designate in an OpenStack virtual machine flavor name?",
    "answer": "The prefix 'g' designates 'vGPU' in an OpenStack virtual machine flavor name."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the amount of RAM indicated in an OpenStack flavor name after the prefix and vCPU/vGPU count?",
    "answer": "The amount of RAM is indicated after the dash following the number of virtual vCPUs/vGPUs in an OpenStack flavor name."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the size of the secondary ephemeral disk indicated in an OpenStack flavor name?",
    "answer": "If a second dash is present in an OpenStack flavor name, it is followed by the size of the secondary ephemeral disk in gigabytes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the intended use for a virtual machine with a 'c' flavor?",
    "answer": "A virtual machine of 'c' flavor is intended for jobs of finite lifetime and for development and testing tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of image does a 'c' flavor virtual machine start from?",
    "answer": "A 'c' flavor virtual machine starts from a qcow2-format image."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where do the disks for a 'c' flavor VM reside and what is their redundancy level?",
    "answer": "The disks for a 'c' flavor VM reside on the local hardware running the VM and have no redundancy (RAID0)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical size of the root disk for a 'c' flavor virtual machine?",
    "answer": "The root disk for a 'c' flavor virtual machine is typically 20GB in size."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Arbutus cloud treat 'c' flavors regarding CPU over-commit and target tasks?",
    "answer": "The Arbutus cloud treats 'c' flavors differently as they have no over-commit on CPU and are targeted towards CPU intensive tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the intended use for a virtual machine with a 'p' flavor?",
    "answer": "A virtual machine of 'p' flavor is intended to run for an indeterminate length of time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a predefined root disk for 'p' flavor virtual machines?",
    "answer": "No, there is no predefined root disk for 'p' flavor virtual machines."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are 'p' flavors intended to be booted?",
    "answer": "The intended use of 'p' flavors is that they should be booted from a volume."
  },
  {
    "question": "What storage system backs a 'p' instance if it is booted from a volume, and what benefits does this provide?",
    "answer": "If a 'p' instance is booted from a volume, it will be backed by the Ceph storage system, providing greater redundancy and resistance to failure than a 'c' instance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended volume size for the persistent VM root disk when using a 'p' flavor?",
    "answer": "We recommend using a volume size of at least 20GB for the persistent VM root disk when using a 'p' flavor."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Arbutus cloud treat 'p' flavors regarding CPU over-commit and their typical usage profiles?",
    "answer": "The Arbutus cloud treats 'p' flavors differently as they will be on compute nodes with a higher level of redundancy (disk and network) and do over-commit the CPU, making them geared towards web servers, database servers, and instances that have a lower or bursty CPU usage profile in general."
