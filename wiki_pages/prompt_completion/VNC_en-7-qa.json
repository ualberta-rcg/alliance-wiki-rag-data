    "question": "How do you manually add the VirtualGL system library to an OpenGL application's binary using `patchelf`?",
    "answer": "First, load the `nix` module, then use the command `patchelf --add-needed /usr/lib64/VirtualGL/libvglfaker.so ~/.local/bin/myglapp` (replacing `~/.local/bin/myglapp` with your application's binary path)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an alternative method for preloading `vglfaker.so` besides using `patchelf`?",
    "answer": "It is also possible to preload `vglfaker.so` via the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is using the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable for `vglfaker.so` generally not recommended?",
    "answer": "It is generally a bad idea because it applies indiscriminately to all binaries, and those that require a different `vglfaker.so` than what is set in `LD_PRELOAD` will fail."
  },
  {
    "question": "When can `LD_PRELOAD` be used safely to preload `vglfaker.so`?",
    "answer": "`LD_PRELOAD` can be used safely in some cases in wrapper scripts."
