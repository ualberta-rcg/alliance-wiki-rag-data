  {
    "question": "What is archiving?",
    "answer": "Archiving means creating one file that contains a number of smaller files within it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of archiving data?",
    "answer": "Archiving data can improve the efficiency of file storage and file transfers, making it faster to transfer one archive file of a reasonable size than thousands of small files of equal total size."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does compressing data mean?",
    "answer": "Compressing means encoding a file such that the same information is contained in fewer bytes of storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary archiving utility on Linux and Unix-like systems?",
    "answer": "The primary archiving utility on all Linux and Unix-like systems is the `tar` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `tar` command do?",
    "answer": "The `tar` command bundles a bunch of files or directories together and generates a single file, called an 'archive file' or 'tar-file'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the conventional file name extension for a tar archive file?",
    "answer": "By convention, an archive file has `.tar` as the file name extension."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you archive a directory named `project1` into a file named `project1.tar`?",
    "answer": "You can archive a directory using the command: `tar --create --file project1.tar project1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the original directory when archiving it with `tar`?",
    "answer": "The original directory will remain unchanged, which may double the amount of disk space occupied."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract files from a tar archive named `project1.tar`?",
    "answer": "You can extract files from an archive using the command: `tar --extract --file project1.tar`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a directory with the original name exists when extracting a tar archive?",
    "answer": "If a directory of that name exists and contains files of the same names as in the archive file, they will be overwritten."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can `tar` compress an archive file while creating it?",
    "answer": "Yes, `tar` can compress an archive file at the same time it creates it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which compression methods are recommended for use with `tar`?",
    "answer": "The recommended compression methods are `xz` or `gzip`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create an `xz`-compressed tar archive named `project1.tar.xz` from a directory `project1`?",
    "answer": "You use the command: `tar --create --xz --file project1.tar.xz project1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract an `xz`-compressed tar archive named `project1.tar.xz`?",
    "answer": "You use the command: `tar --extract --xz --file project1.tar.xz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create a `gzip`-compressed tar archive named `project1.tar.gz` from a directory `project1`?",
    "answer": "You use the command: `tar --create --gzip --file project1.tar.gz project1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you extract a `gzip`-compressed tar archive named `project1.tar.gz`?",
    "answer": "You use the command: `tar --extract --gzip --file project1.tar.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical characteristics of `xz` compression compared to `gzip`?",
    "answer": "`xz` typically produces a smaller compressed file but takes longer and uses more RAM, while `gzip` generally does not compress as small but is faster and uses less memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to perform compression separately after creating a `tar` archive?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can run `tar --create` first without compression and then use the `xz` or `gzip` commands in a separate step, although there is rarely a reason to do so."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two synonymous forms for `tar` command options?",
    "answer": "There is a single-letter form prefixed with a single dash (e.g., `-c`) and a whole-word form prefixed with a double dash (e.g., `--create`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-c` or `--create` option in `tar`?",
    "answer": "It is used to create a new archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-f` or `--file=` option in `tar`?",
    "answer": "It is used to specify the archive file name."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-x` or `--extract` option in `tar`?",
    "answer": "It is used to extract files from an archive."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-t` or `--list` option in `tar`?",
    "answer": "It is used to list the contents of an archive file."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-J` or `--xz` option in `tar`?",
    "answer": "It is used to compress or uncompress with `xz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `-z` or `--gzip` option in `tar`?",
    "answer": "It is used to compress or uncompress with `gzip`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can single-letter `tar` options be combined?",
    "answer": "Single-letter options can be combined with a single dash, for example, `tar -cJf project1.tar.xz project1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you get a complete list of `tar` options available on your system?",
    "answer": "You can get a complete list of options with `man tar` or `tar --help`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do all `tar` systems support `xz` compression?",
    "answer": "No, some older systems might not support `--xz` compression."
