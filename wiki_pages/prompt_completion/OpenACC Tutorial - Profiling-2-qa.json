  {
    "question": "What compiler optimizations were applied to the `matvec` function's loop containing reductions as indicated by the feedback?",
    "answer": "The compiler generated vector SIMD code and FMA (fused multiply-add) instructions for the loop containing reductions in `matvec`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the reported intensity for several loops within the `allocate_3d_poisson_matrix` function when it was inlined into `main`?",
    "answer": "The intensity for several loops within the inlined `allocate_3d_poisson_matrix` function was 0.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the compiler feedback for the inlined `allocate_3d_poisson_matrix` function, why was one loop not vectorized or parallelized?",
    "answer": "One loop in the inlined `allocate_3d_poisson_matrix` function was not vectorized or parallelized because its loop count was too small."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific optimization, identified as an 'idiom,' was applied to the `initialize_vector` function when inlined into `main`?",
    "answer": "The loop in the inlined `initialize_vector` function was replaced by a call to `__c_mset8`, which is identified as a 'Memory set idiom'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How was the first inlined instance of `waxpby` in `main` optimized, and what was its reported intensity?",
    "answer": "The loop in this instance of `waxpby` was replaced by a call to `__c_mcopy8` (Memory copy idiom), and its intensity was 0.0."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why was the intensity for a loop in the inlined `matvec` function reported as `[symbolic]` and not printable?",
    "answer": "The intensity was reported as `[symbolic]` and not printable, with a suggestion to try the `-Mpfi -Mpfo` options."
  },
  {
    "question": "For a specific `waxpby` loop that was inlined into `main`, what prevented it from being fused or vectorized?",
    "answer": "It was not fused due to a different loop trip count and not vectorized due to a data dependency."
  },
  {
    "question": "What optimizations were still applied to a `waxpby` loop that had an intensity of 0.67, despite not being fused or fully vectorized?",
    "answer": "Vector SIMD code was generated, the loop was unrolled 4 times, and FMA (fused multiply-add) instructions were generated for this `waxpby` loop."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the intensity for a loop within the `dot` function when inlined into `main`, and what optimization was applied to it?",
    "answer": "The intensity was 1.00, and generated vector SIMD code for the loop containing reductions within the inlined `dot` function."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the compiler feedback for the inlined `dot` function, what was a reason for a loop not being fused, distinct from data dependencies or trip counts?",
    "answer": "One loop in the inlined `dot` function was not fused due to 'different controlling conditions'."
  },
  {
    "question": "For an instance where `waxpby` was inlined into `main` (line 78), what was its intensity and why was it not fused?",
    "answer": "The intensity was 0.67, and it was not fused due to a function call before an adjacent loop."
