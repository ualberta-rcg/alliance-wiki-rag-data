  },
  {
    "question": "Which CentOS image is mentioned for ZFS installation?",
    "answer": "The `CentOS-7-x64-2018-09` image is mentioned for ZFS installation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you install ZFS on CentOS?",
    "answer": "To install ZFS on CentOS, run `sudo yum install http://download.zfsonlinux.org/epel/zfs-release.el7_5.noarch.rpm`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are ZFS installation instructions available for Fedora?",
    "answer": "No, the instructions for installing ZFS on Fedora are marked 'to be written!'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to create a new zpool named 'data' using '/dev/vdb' and '/dev/vdc'?",
    "answer": "Run `sudo zpool create -f data /dev/vdb /dev/vdc` to create the zpool."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the default mount point for a zpool named 'data' created with `zpool create`?",
    "answer": "A new mount point will be created at `/data`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the size of a ZFS filesystem compare to the combined sizes of its underlying volumes?",
    "answer": "The filesystem will have a size slightly smaller than the combined sizes of all attached volumes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is data handled across multiple drives in a basic ZFS zpool?",
    "answer": "As data is written to the mount point, it will be dynamically stripped across all drives."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does creating a zpool using `sudo zpool create` provide data replication?",
    "answer": "No, it does not provide any additional data replication."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can ZFS compress data?",
    "answer": "Yes, ZFS can compress data as it is written to the file system and uncompress it when it is read."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you enable compression for a zpool?",
    "answer": "To turn on and choose a compression algorithm for a zpool, use the `sudo zfs set compression=<algorithm> <pool_name>` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command sets the `lz4` compression algorithm for the 'data' zpool?",
    "answer": "Run `sudo zfs set compression=lz4 data`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might ZFS compression provide a significant reduction in storage use?",
    "answer": "You may see a larger reduction in storage use if your data is more compressible, such as ASCII data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can compression improve file I/O performance in ZFS?",
    "answer": "Yes, using compression can improve file I/O performance because less data needs to be read and written."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the `lz4` algorithm recommended for ZFS compression?",
    "answer": "The `lz4` algorithm was chosen because it is a reasonable compromise between speed and the amount of compression achieved."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view all properties for a ZFS pool?",
    "answer": "To see a list of properties for your pool, use the command `sudo zfs get all <pool_name>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command displays all properties for the 'data' zpool?",
    "answer": "Run `sudo zfs get all data`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are datasets in ZFS?",
    "answer": "ZFS zpools can be further subdivided into datasets, which allow you to operate on smaller portions of your zpool independently."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of ZFS datasets?",
    "answer": "A dataset allows you to operate on smaller portions of your zpool independently, for example, by setting a different compression algorithm for the dataset."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create a dataset named 'www' within the 'data' zpool?",
    "answer": "Run `sudo zfs create data/www`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is growing a zpool difficult compared to other filesystems?",
    "answer": "No, growing a zpool is a relatively simple task when compared to other file systems and logical volume managers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two steps to grow a zpool?",
    "answer": "The two steps are: 1) add a new volume to your VM, and 2) add the new device to your zpool."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to add a new device to an existing zpool?",
    "answer": "The command to add a new device to an existing zpool is `sudo zpool add <pool_name> <device>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you add the device '/dev/vde' to the 'data' zpool?",
    "answer": "Run `sudo zpool add data /dev/vde`."
