    "question": "What is ZFS?",
    "answer": "ZFS is a combined file system and logical volume manager designed by Sun Microsystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some key capabilities of ZFS?",
    "answer": "ZFS can scale to very large file system sizes and supports compression."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does ZFS simplify increasing filesystem size?",
    "answer": "ZFS greatly simplifies the process of increasing a filesystem size by allowing you to add new volumes to your VM and then add them to your ZFS filesystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can a ZFS filesystem be grown while it is in use?",
    "answer": "Yes, increasing a ZFS filesystem size can be done while the filesystem is live and file IO is occurring on the filesystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What image is recommended for installing ZFS on Ubuntu?",
    "answer": "The recommended image for installing ZFS on Ubuntu is `Ubuntu-18.04-Bionic-x64-2018-09`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to update package lists and upgrade installed packages on Ubuntu before installing ZFS?",
    "answer": "The commands are `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you install ZFS on Ubuntu?",
    "answer": "To install ZFS on Ubuntu, use the command `sudo apt-get install zfsutils-linux`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What image is recommended for installing ZFS on CentOS?",
    "answer": "The recommended image for installing ZFS on CentOS is `CentOS-7-x64-2018-09`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you install ZFS on CentOS?",
    "answer": "To install ZFS on CentOS, use the command `sudo yum install http://download.zfsonlinux.org/epel/zfs-release.el7_5.noarch.rpm`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What image is mentioned for installing ZFS on Fedora?",
    "answer": "The image mentioned for Fedora is `Fedora-Cloud-Base-29-1.2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there instructions for installing ZFS on Fedora?",
    "answer": "No, the instructions for installing ZFS on Fedora are 'to be written!'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to create a new zpool named 'data' using devices /dev/vdb and /dev/vdc?",
    "answer": "The command is `sudo zpool create -f data /dev/vdb /dev/vdc`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where will a zpool created with `sudo zpool create -f data /dev/vdb /dev/vdc` be mounted?",
    "answer": "It will create a new mount point at `/data`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is data handled across drives in a newly created zpool like 'data'?",
    "answer": "As data is written to the `/data` mount point it will be dynamically stripped across all drives."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does creating a zpool by stripping data across drives provide data replication?",
    "answer": "No, this method of stripping data across drives does not provide any additional data replication."
  },
  {
    "question": "What ZFS feature can improve storage use and potentially file IO performance?",
    "answer": "ZFS can compress data as it is written to the file system and uncompress it when it is read."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to enable lz4 compression on a zpool named 'data'?",
    "answer": "The command is `sudo zfs set compression=lz4 data`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of data might see a larger reduction in storage use with compression?",
    "answer": "If your data is something more compressible, such as ascii data, you may see a larger reduction in storage use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why can using compression improve file IO performance?",
    "answer": "Using compression can improve file IO performance because less data needs to be read and written."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the characteristic of the lz4 compression algorithm?",
    "answer": "The lz4 algorithm was chosen because it is a reasonable compromise between speed and amount of compression achieved."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to see a list of properties for a zpool?",
    "answer": "The command is `sudo zfs get all data`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are datasets in ZFS?",
    "answer": "Zpools can be further subdivided into datasets, which allow you to operate on smaller portions of your zpool independently, for example, setting different compression algorithms."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create a dataset named 'www' within the 'data' zpool?",
    "answer": "The command is `sudo zfs create data/www`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two steps to grow a zpool?",
    "answer": "The two steps to grow a zpool are: 1) add a new volume to your VM and 2) add the new device to your zpool."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to add a new device '/dev/vde' to the zpool 'data'?",
    "answer": "The command is `sudo zpool add data /dev/vde`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does the process of growing a zpool usually take?",
    "answer": "This process usually takes less than a minute even for very large several TB sized zpools and volumes."
