    "question": "What is the name of the Slurm script used for running Ansys Fluent on multiple nodes (per node) on Niagara?",
    "answer": "The script is named `script-flu-bynode-intel-nia.sh`."

    "question": "How are license settings typically configured for Ansys Fluent jobs submitted with `script-flu-bynode-intel-nia.sh` on Niagara?",
    "answer": "License settings are explicitly defined within the script itself, specifying `LICSERVER`, `FLEXPORT`, `INTEPORT`, and `VENDPORT`. These settings are then used to set up SSH port forwarding to `localhost` and export the `ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE` and `ANSYSLI_SERVERS` variables to point to `localhost`."

    "question": "What are the default values for the license server, flex port, interconnect port, and vendor port specified in the Niagara Fluent script?",
