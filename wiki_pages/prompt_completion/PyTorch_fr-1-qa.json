  },
  {
    "question": "What does the `pytorch-test.py` script demonstrate if CUDA is available?",
    "answer": "The `pytorch-test.py` script demonstrates basic tensor operations and, if CUDA is available, it moves the tensors `x` and `y` to the GPU and prints their sum."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you submit a PyTorch job using the `pytorch-test.sh` script?",
    "answer": "You submit a PyTorch job using the `sbatch pytorch-test.sh` command."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the potential drawback of using TF32?",
    "answer": "The performance gain from TF32 can lead to a decrease in the numerical precision of operation results, which can be problematic for deep learning models using ill-conditioned matrices or long sequences of tensor operations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the default status of TF32 in PyTorch versions 1.7.x to 1.11.x?",
    "answer": "In PyTorch versions 1.7.x to 1.11.x, TF32 mode was enabled by default for tensor operations."
