    "question": "What is an example of an SBATCH script for running QIIME2 with Apptainer?",
    "answer": "An example SBATCH script sets a time limit and account, then uses `apptainer exec` with bind mounts to import sequence data (`FeatureData[Sequence]`), import taxonomy data (`FeatureData[Taxonomy]`), and fit a naive Bayes classifier."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are directories mounted when running QIIME2 inside an Apptainer container via an SBATCH script?",
    "answer": "Directories are mounted using the `-B` (bind) option with `apptainer exec`, for instance, `-B $PWD:/home`, `-B /scratch/someuser:/outputs`, and `-B /project/def-somePI/someuser/path/to/inputs:/inputs`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific QIIME operations are shown in the provided Apptainer SBATCH script example?",
    "answer": "The script demonstrates `qiime tools import` for sequence data and taxonomy data, and `qiime feature-classifier fit-classifier-naive-bayes` to train a classifier."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to use the bind option (`-B`) when executing programs in an Apptainer container?",
    "answer": "It is important to use the bind option (`-B`) with each directory you want to work with when programs are executed inside your container."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more information about Apptainer bind mounts?",
    "answer": "More information about Apptainer bind mounts can be found in a dedicated Apptainer webinar."

  {
    "question": "What message might appear when data is imported into QIIME format for the first time?",
    "answer": "You might receive a message similar to 'Timezone offset does not match system offset: 0 != -18000. Please, check your config files.' when importing data into QIIME format for the first time."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'Timezone offset does not match system offset' warning be resolved when using Apptainer with QIIME?",
    "answer": "To resolve this warning, you can define the timezone as UTC before invoking Apptainer, for example, by running `export TZ='UTC'` before the `apptainer exec` command."
