    "question": "What is the primary goal of evaluating job efficiency?",
    "answer": "The primary goal is to ensure that jobs make efficient use of assigned resources, which is important for being a responsible user, especially when using new programs or making substantial changes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view all jobs the scheduler is managing?",
    "answer": "By default, `squeue` will show all the jobs the scheduler is managing at the moment."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you quickly view only your own jobs using `squeue`?",
    "answer": "You can view only your own jobs using the command `$ squeue -u $USER`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a shorter utility to display your own jobs similar to `squeue -u $USER`?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can use the utility `sq` to achieve the same result with less typing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you filter `squeue` output to show only running jobs?",
    "answer": "You can show only running jobs using `$ squeue -u <username> -t RUNNING`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you display only pending jobs with `squeue`?",
    "answer": "To display only pending jobs, use the command `$ squeue -u <username> -t PENDING`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which command provides detailed information for a specific job?",
    "answer": "You can show detailed information for a specific job with `scontrol` using `$ scontrol show job -dd <jobid>`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an important caution when running `squeue` from a script?",
    "answer": "Do not run `squeue` from a script or program at high frequency (e.g., every few seconds), as it adds load to Slurm and may interfere with its performance or correct operation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you set up email notifications for job conditions in Slurm?",
    "answer": "You can ask to be notified by email by supplying options to sbatch, such as `#SBATCH --mail-user=your.email@example.com` and `#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'buffered output' mean for a non-interactive Slurm job?",
    "answer": "Buffered output means there's a delay between when data is written by the job and when you can see it on a login node. This delay can range from less than a second to many minutes, or until the job completes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it recommended to reduce or eliminate output buffering for Slurm jobs?",
    "answer": "No, it is not recommended because buffering is vital to preserving the overall performance of the filesystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended method for monitoring job output in real time?",
    "answer": "If you need to monitor job output in real time, it is recommended to run an interactive job."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which utility provides a short summary of CPU and memory efficiency for a completed job?",
    "answer": "The `seff` utility provides a short summary of the CPU and memory efficiency of a completed job."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you get more detailed information about a completed job, and optionally format its output?",
    "answer": "You can find more detailed information with `sacct`, and control what it prints using the `--format` option, for example: `$ sacct -j <jobid> --format=JobID,JobName,MaxRSS,Elapsed`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the `.bat+`, `.ext+`, and `.0` records in `sacct` output typically represent?",
    "answer": "The `.bat+` record represents the batch step (submission script), `.ext+` is the extern step (prologue/epilogue), and `.0` (or similar) indicates a step created by `srun` within your submission script."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you view all records for a given job, including any restarts due to node failures, using `sacct`?",
    "answer": "To see all records related to a given job, including restarts, add the `--duplicates` option to your `sacct` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which `sacct` accounting field shows the maximum memory a job needed?",
    "answer": "The `MaxRSS` accounting field is used to determine how much memory a job needed."
