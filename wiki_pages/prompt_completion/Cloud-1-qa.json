    "answer": "Virtual machines are also referred to as VMs or instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can virtual machines be easily replicated?",
    "answer": "Virtual machines can be easily replicated by taking a snapshot of a VM, which can then be started again elsewhere."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the benefits of using VM snapshots?",
    "answer": "VM snapshots make it easy to replicate or scale up a service and to recover from interruptions like power outages."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is it preferable to work outside the cloud environment?",
    "answer": "It is preferable to work outside the cloud if your work fits easily into the HPC (High-Performance Computing) batch submission workflow, as there are more resources available for HPC and software is often pre-configured."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tool allows running custom software stacks inside containers within HPC clusters?",
    "answer": "Apptainer is a tool available to run custom software stacks inside containers within HPC clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is the cloud considered the appropriate solution for a user's needs?",
    "answer": "The cloud is the solution if your needs are not served by Apptainer or HPC batch processing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What important role should users understand before getting a cloud project?",
    "answer": "Users should understand their important role in safeguarding their research and the shared cloud infrastructure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first step if a user doesn't have an account to access cloud services?",
    "answer": "If a user does not have an account, they must create one using the provided instructions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is defined as a 'project' in the context of cloud services?",
    "answer": "A project is an allocation of resources specifically for creating virtual machines within a cloud."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Primary Investigators (PIs) with an active resource allocation typically get a cloud project?",
    "answer": "Primary Investigators (PIs) with an active cloud resource allocation (RAC) should already have a project."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users submit requests for cloud projects or access?",
    "answer": "Users can submit requests through the Alliance cloud project and RAS request form."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of requests can a Primary Investigator (PI) make via the Alliance cloud project and RAS request form?",
    "answer": "A PI can request access to an existing project, request a new project with the Rapid Access Service (RAS), or request an increase in quota for an existing project."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long do cloud project requests typically take to be processed?",
    "answer": "Requests are typically processed within two business days."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information is required when requesting access to an existing cloud project?",
    "answer": "When requesting access, you need to know the project name and which cloud it is on, and the request must be confirmed by the PI owning the project."
  },
  {
    "question": "What justification is required when requesting a new cloud project or an increase in quota?",
    "answer": "Justification must include why cloud resources are needed, why an HPC cluster is not suitable, plans for efficient resource usage, and plans for maintenance and security."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many projects can a Primary Investigator (PI) own, and what are the limitations?",
    "answer": "A PI may own up to 3 projects, but the sum of all project quotas must be within the RAS allocation limits."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find instructions for manually creating their first virtual machine?",
    "answer": "Instructions for manually creating the first VM can be found in the Cloud Quick Start guide."
