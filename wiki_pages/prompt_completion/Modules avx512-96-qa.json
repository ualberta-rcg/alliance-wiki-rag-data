  {
    "question": "What is the main difference between Platanus and Platanus-allee assemblers?",
    "answer": "Platanus-allee constructs each haplotype sequence from the beginning and pairs them as homologous chromosomes, while Platanus constructs a consensus sequence of homologous chromosomes first and then attempts to split it into individual haplotype sequences. Platanus-allee is noted for better performance with highly heterozygous species genomes or highly diverged genomic regions."
