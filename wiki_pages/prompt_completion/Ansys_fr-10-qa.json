    "question": "How do you configure Fluent to interpret a User-Defined Function (UDF) at runtime?",
    "answer": "To configure Fluent to interpret a UDF at runtime, add the command `define/user-defined/interpreted-functions \"sampleudf.c\" \"cpp\" 10000 no` to your journal file before the case/data files are read or initialized. Remember to replace \"sampleudf.c\" with your actual source file name."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required before using an interpreted UDF with parallel tasks in Fluent?",
    "answer": "Before an interpreted UDF can be used with parallel tasks in Fluent, it must be parallelized as described in the dedicated section on parallel UDFs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the process for using a compiled UDF in Fluent on the clusters?",
    "answer": "To use a compiled UDF, it must first be compiled on one of the clusters, which creates a `libudf` subdirectory containing `libudf.so`. This `libudf` directory can then be transferred to other clusters if the same `StdEnv` module version is loaded. In your journal file, uncomment the `load libudf` line to use it, but avoid leaving both `compile` and `load` lines uncommented for submitted tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why can't I just copy the `libudf` directory from my local machine to the cluster?",
    "answer": "You cannot simply copy the `libudf` directory from a distant system to the cluster because the shared library dependencies will not be met, causing Fluent to crash at startup."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it efficient to recompile a UDF for every job submission?",
    "answer": "No, recompiling a UDF for every job submission by leaving both `compile` and `load` lines uncommented in the journal file is very inefficient and can lead to \"racetime\" build conflicts if multiple jobs run from the same directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I compile a UDF using Fluent's graphical interface?",
    "answer": "To compile a UDF using Fluent's graphical interface, add the UDF source file in the \"Compiled UDFs\" dialog box and click \"Build\"."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is necessary for a UDF to work with parallel Fluent tasks?",
    "answer": "Before a UDF can be used with parallel Fluent tasks (single-node SMP and multi-node MPI), it must be parallelized by adding compilation directives, predicates, and reduction macros to the sequential UDF."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if a UDF is not parallelized for parallel Fluent tasks?",
    "answer": "If a UDF is not parallelized for parallel Fluent tasks, Fluent will run slowly at best or crash immediately at worst."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find detailed information on parallelizing a UDF?",
    "answer": "Detailed information on parallelizing a UDF can be found in the `Fluent Customization Manual, Part I: Chapter 7: Parallel Considerations`, which is available in the online documentation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are UDFs used to customize Discrete Phase Models (DPM) in Fluent?",
    "answer": "UDFs can customize DPM by defining particle injections through `Point Properties` in the graphical interface or by reading an injection text file. Once configured, commands can be added to the journal file to automate these steps, such as `/define/models/dpm/interaction/coupled-calculations yes` and `/define/models/dpm/injections/create`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of information is specified in `Point Properties` for DPM injection?",
    "answer": "`Point Properties` for DPM injection specify variables like source position, initial trajectory, mass flow rate, duration, temperature, and more, depending on the injection type."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical file extension for manually created injection text files for DPM?",
    "answer": "Manually created injection text files for DPM usually have a `.inj` extension."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you enable interaction between the discrete and continuous phases in the Discrete Phase Model?",
    "answer": "To enable interaction, you need to select `Interaction with Continuous Phase` in the Discrete Phase Model dialog box, which updates DPM source terms at each flow iteration. This can also be set via the journal file with `/define/models/dpm/interaction/coupled-calculations yes`."
