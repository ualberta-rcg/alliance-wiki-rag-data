  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `script-flu-bycore+restart.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The script automates the restart of Ansys Fluent simulations from recently saved time step files, particularly for tasks that may exceed typical job time limits."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify the number of solution restarts for a Fluent job using this script?",
    "answer": "The number of restart attempts (or time steps) is specified using the `#SBATCH --array=1-5%1` parameter, where '5' represents the total number of attempts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Slurm parameters are configured for a Fluent job requesting restarts by core?",
    "answer": "The script includes parameters such as `--account` (e.g., `def-group`), `--time` (e.g., `00-03:00`), `--ntasks` (total number of cores, e.g., `16`), `--mem-per-cpu` (e.g., `4G`), `--cpus-per-task=1`, and `--array` (for restarts)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Ansys Fluent module and standard environment are loaded by default in the `bycore+restart.sh` script?",
    "answer": "The script loads `StdEnv/2023` and `ansys/2023R2` (or newer versions). Older versions like `ansys/2019R3` or `ansys/2021R2` for `StdEnv/2020` are also mentioned as previously supported."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the initial and restart journal files specified in the script?",
    "answer": "The initial journal file is specified by `MYJOUFILE` (e.g., `sample.jou`), and the restart journal file is specified by `MYJOUFILERES` (e.g., `sample-restart.jou`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the naming convention for restart case and data files in the script?",
    "answer": "The restart case file is named `MYCASFILERES` (e.g., `sample-restart.cas.h5`), and the restart data file is named `MYDATFILERES` (e.g., `sample-restart.dat.h5`)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the script determine if it's running the initial job step or a restart step?",
    "answer": "The script uses the `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` variable: if `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID == 1`, it's the initial run; otherwise, it's a restart step."
  },
  {
    "question": "What actions are taken after a successful step in a restart job to prepare for the next restart?",
    "answer": "If a step completes successfully and more restarts are pending, the script creates symbolic links (`ln -sfv`) for `MYCASFILERES` and `MYDATFILERES` to point to the most recently saved output case and data files in the `output/` directory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the script handle job completion or failure in a restart sequence?",
    "answer": "If Fluent completes successfully (`$? -eq 0`), the script echoes success and cancels the array job. If it fails, it echoes a failure message and will proceed to the next attempt in the array if `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` is less than `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of Fluent journal files?",
    "answer": "Fluent journal files contain Text User Interface (TUI) commands that can be used to modify simulation parameters, such as temperature, pressure, or flow speed, and to perform a series of simulations under different conditions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do journal files manage different Fluent file formats?",
    "answer": "Journal files use `/file/cff-file no` for the `.cas/.dat` formats (default for modules up to 2019R3) and `/file/cff-files yes` for the more efficient `.cas.h5/.dat.h5` formats (from 2020R1 onwards)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can users find more detailed information about Fluent TUI commands for journal files?",
    "answer": "Users should consult the Fluent user guide for further information and a comprehensive list of commands."
