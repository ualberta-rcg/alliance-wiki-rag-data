    "question": "What information should an RRG application include regarding progress over the past year?",
    "answer": "An RRG application should show achievements, outcomes, and/or evidence of progress resulting from the utilization of resources provided by the Federation over the past year."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should an RRG application describe concerning computational methods?",
    "answer": "The application should describe appropriate tools, methods, and approaches for addressing the research objectives, including community codes or models, data analysis methods, algorithmic formulations, user-developed scripts or tools, and trials or test implementations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What details are required for the 'Resource Request Justification' in an RRG application?",
    "answer": "The justification must provide a reasonable explanation for low utilization (if applicable) of an existing allocation, state that the requested resources are appropriate with excellent technical justification, and describe necessary and sufficient computational experiments."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary focus of the 'Resource Management and Computational Expertise' criterion for RRG applications?",
    "answer": "This criterion evaluates the research team's capacity to manage the project, efficiently use requested resources, and assesses the overall feasibility of the computational project based on the team's research and computational expertise."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is included in the 'team' when evaluating 'Resource Management and Computational Expertise' for RRG applications?",
    "answer": "The team includes the Principal Investigator (PI), Co-PIs (if applicable), and any Highly Qualified Personnel (HQP) actively participating in the computational project."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the definition of Highly Qualified Personnel (HQP) in the context of RRG applications?",
    "answer": "HQP includes all research personnel involved in the applicant's computational project, whether from academia, government, or industry, and their number directly using Federation resources is expected to be appropriate to the project's scope."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the experiences and contributions of PIs and Co-PIs be assessed during the RRG review process?",
    "answer": "Their experiences and contributions should be assessed in the context of their career stages, and committee members must only consider information appearing in the application and the provided Canadian Common CV (CCV)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it mandatory to include Co-PIs or HQP to achieve a full score for the 'Resource Management' criterion in an RRG application?",
    "answer": "No, it is not mandatory to include Co-PIs or HQP, but the proposed research must be achievable by the listed team members, especially if it's only one PI and/or if there is no funding available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is expected regarding funding for RRG applications that request large amounts of resources?",
    "answer": "It is expected that applications asking for large amounts of resources will have funding to justify the request."
  },
  {
    "question": "What dictates the level of detail required for a high score in the 'Resource Management' criterion for RRG applications?",
    "answer": "The level of detail needed is a function of the team size and the amount of resources requested (resource ask)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key consideration regarding funding under the 'Resource Management' criterion for RRG applications?",
    "answer": "Funding must be available for the research project to justify the request for computational resources; if not, a reasonable explanation for how the compute resources will be utilized must be provided."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the RRG evaluation look for concerning the computational expertise of the team?",
    "answer": "The team should demonstrate sufficient computational expertise or present a training plan to make effective and efficient use of the requested computational resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should an RRG application's 'Management Strategy' clearly describe?",
    "answer": "It should clearly describe information about each team member (PI, Co-PIs, and HQP), their requested computational resources, the roles and responsibilities of the PI and Co-PIs, and demonstrate the team's combined expertise and experience to execute the project."
  },
  {
    "question": "What aspects should be clearly presented in the 'Project Description, Objectives and Impact' section of an RPP application?",
    "answer": "The problem or need that the research platform/portal will address must be clearly presented, along with its objectives and goals."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should an RPP application explain about the 'Use of the Platform/Portal'?",
    "answer": "The application should clearly explain the added value of the platform or portal for the targeted communities and, if applicable, describe the level of interaction between Canadian and international research groups."
  },
  {
    "question": "What must the 'Expected Outcomes' section of an RPP application include?",
    "answer": "The application must present a clear timeline for the delivery of anticipated outcomes over the entire duration of the requested resources and indicate the means by which these outcomes will be measured."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required in an RPP application regarding 'Progress over the Past Year'?",
    "answer": "The application must show achievements, outcomes, and/or evidence of progress from using Federation resources over the past year, and provide a reasonable justification for low utilization of an existing allocation, if applicable."
  },
  {
    "question": "What constitutes a strong 'Resource Request Justification' for an RPP application?",
    "answer": "The amount of resources requested must be deemed appropriate to achieve the project objectives, and a solid technical justification for these resources must be provided."
