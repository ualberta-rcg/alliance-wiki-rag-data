    "question": "What is OpenACC?",
    "answer": "OpenACC is an application programming interface (API) designed for porting code onto accelerators such as GPUs and coprocessors."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which organizations were involved in the development of OpenACC?",
    "answer": "OpenACC was developed by Cray, CAPS, NVidia, and PGI."
  },
  {
    "question": "What programming languages does OpenACC support, and how does it work with them?",
    "answer": "OpenACC supports C, C++, or Fortran code. Programmers annotate portions of the code to identify sections that should be parallelized by the compiler, similar to OpenMP."
  },
  {

    "answer": "Yes, SHARCNET offers a self-paced course titled 'Introduction to GPU Programming'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a prerequisite for gaining the most benefit from this OpenACC tutorial?",
    "answer": "A working knowledge of C, C++, or Fortran is required, as the tutorial uses OpenACC to accelerate code in these languages."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can the examples for this tutorial be downloaded?",
    "answer": "All examples for this tutorial can be downloaded from the Github repository: [https://github.com/calculquebec/cq-formation-openacc]."
  },
  {
    "question": "What topics are covered in the lesson plan of this OpenACC tutorial?",
    "answer": "The lesson plan includes Introduction, Gathering a profile and getting compiler information, Expressing parallelism with OpenACC directives, Expressing data movement, and Optimizing loops."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you list some useful external references for OpenACC?",
    "answer": "Useful external references include the OpenACC Programming and Best Practices Guide (PDF), OpenACC API 2.7 Reference Guide (PDF), and Getting Started with OpenACC."
