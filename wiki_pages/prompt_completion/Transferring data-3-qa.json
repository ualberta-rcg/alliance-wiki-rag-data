    "question": "How can `rsync` be used to transfer a directory or file locally within a single system?",
    "answer": "Rsync can be used locally by dropping the cluster name, for example: `rsync -avh --no-g --no-p LOCALNAME ~/projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the destination directory (`somedir`) does not exist during a local `rsync` transfer?",
    "answer": "The `somedir` will be created if it doesn't already exist."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the `cp` command differ from `rsync` when transferring a local directory to a non-existent destination directory?",
    "answer": "Unlike `rsync`, if the `LOCALNAME` is a directory, `cp` will rename it to `somedir` if `somedir` does not exist."
  },
  {
    "question": "What `cp` command can be used for local file transfers while preserving mode and timestamps?",
    "answer": "The command `cp -rv --preserve=\"mode,timestamps\" LOCALNAME ~/projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/` can be used."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should checksum utilities be used to verify if files match between two systems?",
    "answer": "Checksum utilities should be used if Globus is unavailable and Rsync is taking too long to synchronize files between two systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which specific checksum utility is used in the provided example to check if files match?",
    "answer": "`sha1sum` is used as the checksum utility in the example."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command generates SHA1 checksums for all files in a user's home directory and logs them to a file?",
    "answer": "The command `find /home/username/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sha1sum | tee checksum-result.log` generates and logs SHA1 checksums."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `checksum-result.log` file created by the checksum generation command?",
    "answer": "The `checksum-result.log` file contains all of the checksums for the files in `/home/username/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended if generating checksums for many files or very large files that might cause an SSH connection to time out?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to run the checksum generation command in the background, in a `GNU Screen` or `tmux` session, to prevent interruption if the SSH connection times out."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you find files that don't match after generating checksum logs on two different systems?",
    "answer": "After running the checksum command on both systems, you can use the `diff` utility, such as `diff checksum-result-silo.log checksum-dtn.log`, to find files that don't match."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might `diff` produce false differences when comparing checksum logs generated by the `find` command?",
    "answer": "The `find` command might crawl through directories in a different order, which can result in a lot of false differences when comparing checksum logs with `diff`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you correct for directory order differences before comparing checksum logs with `diff`?",
    "answer": "You can correct for directory order differences by running `sort -k2` on both checksum log files before running `diff`, for example: `sort -k2 checksum-result-silo.log -o checksum-result-silo.log`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is SFTP and what protocol does it use for file transfer?",
    "answer": "SFTP stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol and it uses the SSH protocol to encrypt data being transferred between machines."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you initiate an SFTP connection to a remote machine using a username and its address?",
    "answer": "You can connect to a remote machine using SFTP with the command `sftp USERNAME@ADDRESS`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you connect to a remote machine via SFTP using an SSH Key for authentication?",
    "answer": "You can connect using the `-i` option, for example: `sftp -i /home/name/.ssh/id_rsa USERNAME@ADDRESS`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What prompt indicates a successful SFTP connection, and how do you list available commands?",
    "answer": "A successful SFTP connection returns the `sftp>` prompt, and you can get a list of available commands by entering `help`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which graphical programs are available for SFTP transfers on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS?",
    "answer": "Graphical programs available for SFTP include WinSCP and MobaXterm (Windows), FileZilla (Windows, Mac, and Linux), and Cyberduck (Mac and Windows)."
