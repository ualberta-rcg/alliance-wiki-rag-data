    "question": "How do you specify the number of cores for multi-core visualization in JupyterLab?",
    "answer": "In the \"Server Options\" within JupyterLab, select the desired number of cores under \"Number of Cores\", for example, 4."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much memory should be requested for multi-core visualization in JupyterLab, based on the number of cores?",
    "answer": "For 4 cores, 14,400 MB of memory should be requested, which corresponds to 3,600 MB per core."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when a JupyterLab session starts after requesting multiple cores for visualization?",
    "answer": "Upon starting the JupyterLab session, you will gain access to an MPI task with the specified number of CPUs (e.g., 4 CPUs)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to start the ParaView server for multi-core visualization in a JupyterLab virtual desktop?",
    "answer": "First, load the necessary modules: `module load boost/1.85.0 paraview/6.0.0`. Then, start the ParaView server using `mpirun --oversubscribe -np 4 pvserver`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch the ParaView client in a JupyterLab virtual desktop for multi-core visualization?",
    "answer": "Open another terminal in the virtual desktop, load the modules (`module load boost/1.85.0 paraview/6.0.0`), and then run `paraview`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to connect the ParaView client to the parallel ParaView server within a JupyterLab session?",
    "answer": "In the ParaView interface, click the 'Connect' button, then 'Add Server'. Set 'Server Type' to 'Client/Server', 'Host' to 'localhost', 'Port' to '11111', and 'Startup Type' to 'Manual'. Finally, click 'Connect' again to establish the connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you verify that parallel rendering is active in ParaView during a multi-core JupyterLab session?",
    "answer": "To verify parallel rendering, you can color your dataset with the `Process Id` variable, which is not available when ParaView is running in sequential mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do users access Open OnDemand for single-core visualization on Nibi or Trillium?",
    "answer": "Users can access Open OnDemand by connecting to https://ondemand.sharcnet.ca for Nibi or https://ondemand.scinet.utoronto.ca for Trillium, using their Alliance account."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to launch a virtual desktop for single-core visualization via Open OnDemand on Nibi?",
    "answer": "After connecting to Open OnDemand, navigate to 'Desktop' (found under 'Compute Nodes | Nibi Desktop' on Nibi). Specify a CPU-only Slurm account and 1 CPU, then click 'Launch'. Wait for the task to transition from 'Starting' to 'Running', then click 'Launch Nibi Desktop'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start ParaView for single-core visualization within an Open OnDemand virtual desktop?",
    "answer": "In the virtual desktop, open a terminal, load the module `paraview/6.0.0`, and then run `paraview`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the memory and core limits when requesting resources for multi-core visualization via Open OnDemand on Nibi?",
    "answer": "Open OnDemand on Nibi allows you to request up to 128GB of memory and up to 8 cores for multi-core visualization."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you initiate a multi-core visualization session using Open OnDemand?",
    "answer": "Initiate a multi-core visualization session by following the same steps as for single-core Open OnDemand visualization, but specify the desired number of cores (e.g., 4 cores) and corresponding memory when requesting resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "What commands are used to start the ParaView server for multi-core visualization in an Open OnDemand virtual desktop?",
    "answer": "First, load the module: `module load paraview/6.0.0`. Then, start the ParaView server using `mpirun --oversubscribe -np 4 pvserver`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you launch the ParaView client in an Open OnDemand virtual desktop for multi-core visualization?",
    "answer": "In the virtual desktop, launch another terminal, load the module (`module load paraview/6.0.0`), and then execute `paraview`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you confirm that ParaView is performing parallel rendering in an Open OnDemand session?",
    "answer": "To confirm parallel rendering, color your dataset with the `Process Id` variable, which is a specific indicator not available in sequential rendering mode."
