    "question": "How do you establish an SSH tunnel for a ParaView client-server connection to Fir or Nibi?",
    "answer": "In a separate terminal on your Mac/Linux computer, you bind the local port 11111 to the same port on the compute node by executing `ssh <username>@fir.alliancecan.ca -L 11111:fc30107:11111`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the steps to connect the ParaView client to a remote server after establishing an SSH tunnel?",
    "answer": "On your computer, start ParaView, go to 'File -> Connect' (or click the green 'Connect' button), click 'Add Server'. Point ParaView to your local port 11111 with parameters like 'name = fir, server type = Client/Server, host = localhost, port = 11111', click 'Configure', select 'Manual', and click 'Save'. Then, select the server from the list and click 'Connect'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What message indicates a successful ParaView client connection on the server terminal?",
    "answer": "In the first terminal window, the message 'Accepting connection ...' will change to 'Client connected'."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you view data after connecting the ParaView client to the remote server?",
    "answer": "Open a ParaView file, which will direct you to the remote file system for visualization."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is NVIDIA IndeX?",
    "answer": "NVIDIA IndeX is an interactive 3D volumetric rendering engine that can be installed as a plugin with ParaView."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the NVIDIA IndeX plugin activated in ParaView client-server mode?",
    "answer": "In your client, go to 'Tools -> Manage Plugins' and activate `pvNVIDIAIndeX` first locally and then remotely."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might activating the NVIDIA IndeX plugin locally first be important?",
    "answer": "In several configurations, a bug can cause ParaView to close abnormally if the local plugin is not activated first, though it may not be necessary on all platforms."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you use NVIDIA IndeX for rendering once it's activated?",
    "answer": "After the plugin is activated, load your dataset, then select NVIDIA IndeX from the 'Representation' dropdown menu."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended when using NVIDIA IndeX with multiple GPUs?",
    "answer": "It is recommended to test your scalability in parallel and verify that employing multiple GPUs provides better performance; if not, you should use a single GPU."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are visualizations on Trillium limited to software-based rendering?",
    "answer": "Trillium does not have a GPU, so rendering must be performed by software."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure ParaView uses software rendering on Trillium?",
    "answer": "You must explicitly use one of the Mesa indicators, such as `paraview --mesa-swr` or `paraview --mesa-swr-avx2`, to prevent ParaView from using hardware OpenGL acceleration."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to launch an interactive task on Trillium to access its resources?",
    "answer": "You launch an interactive task by executing `debugjob`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start the ParaView server on a Trillium compute node after loading the ParaView module?",
    "answer": "Load the ParaView module with `module load paraview` and then start the server using `pvserver --mesa-swr-ax2`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you create an SSH tunnel to a Trillium compute node?",
    "answer": "In a new terminal, without closing `debugjob`, connect via SSH using `ssh YOURusername@trillium.alliancecan.ca -L11111:niaXYZW:11111 -N`."
