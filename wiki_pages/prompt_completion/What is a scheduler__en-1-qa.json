    "question": "What happens to a program if necessary CPU cores are not immediately available on a server?",
    "answer": "The program is put on a waiting list and will begin when the necessary CPU cores are available to prevent interference and performance loss."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do lines starting with `#SBATCH` represent in a job script?",
    "answer": "Lines starting with `#SBATCH` are directives to the scheduler, providing information about what the job needs to run, such as its requested time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the responsibilities of a job scheduler?",
    "answer": "A job scheduler must maintain a database of jobs, enforce policies, ensure resources are not overloaded, decide which jobs to run on which compute nodes, launch them, and clean up after each job finishes."

  {
    "question": "Which specific job scheduler is used on the clusters mentioned in the document?",
    "answer": "The Slurm Workload Manager handles job scheduling responsibilities on these clusters."

  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of requesting resources in a job script?",
    "answer": "You use the job script to ask for the resources needed to run your calculation, such as time and number of processors."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the consequences of requesting too few resources for a job?",
    "answer": "If you ask for less than the calculation needs, the job will be killed for exceeding the requested time or memory limit."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if you request more resources than a job actually needs?",
    "answer": "If you ask for more resources than a job needs, it may wait longer than necessary before it starts, and once running, it will needlessly prevent others from using those resources."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you submit a job script using Slurm?",
    "answer": "You submit a job script using the `sbatch` command, for example, `sbatch simple_job.sh`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command is used to monitor the status of your jobs in Slurm?",
    "answer": "The `sq` command is used to determine the status of your jobs, by looking at the ST column in its output."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two most common states for a job shown in the `sq` output?",
    "answer": "The two most common states are PD for pending and R for running."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a job ID and why is it important?",
    "answer": "A job ID is a unique identification number assigned to each job upon submission, which can be used to distinguish multiple jobs even if they have the same name."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where is the output of a basic Slurm job stored by default?",
    "answer": "The output is placed in a file named with the job ID number, typically `slurm-JOBID.out`."
