    "question": "What is OpenFOAM?",
    "answer": "OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation and Manipulation) CFD Toolbox is a free, open-source software package for computational fluid dynamics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of problems can OpenFOAM solve?",
    "answer": "OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to solid dynamics and electromagnetics."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you load the recent version of OpenFOAM?",
    "answer": "To load the recent version of OpenFOAM, run `module load openfoam`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who comprises the OpenFOAM development community?",
    "answer": "The OpenFOAM development community consists of The OpenFOAM Foundation Ltd. and OpenCFD Ltd."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are OpenFOAM modules from the .com branch identified on clusters after version 2.3.1?",
    "answer": "On our clusters, module names after 2.3.1 which begin with 'v' (for example, `openfoam/v1706`) are derived from the .com branch."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are OpenFOAM modules from the .org branch identified on clusters after version 2.3.1?",
    "answer": "On our clusters, module names after 2.3.1 which begin with a digit (for example, `openfoam/4.1`) are derived from the .org branch."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is required to run OpenFOAM commands like `paraFoam` or `blockMesh`?",
    "answer": "In order to run OpenFOAM commands, you must load a module file."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which OpenFOAM module is used in the example serial submission script?",
    "answer": "The example serial submission script loads `openfoam/12`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which OpenFOAM module is used in the example parallel submission script?",
    "answer": "The example parallel submission script loads `openfoam/12`."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should an OpenFOAM solver like `icoFoam` be submitted as a Slurm job?",
    "answer": "The solver (e.g., `icoFoam`) is usually the most expensive step and should always be submitted as a Slurm job, except in very small test cases or tutorials."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the petscFoam solver included in the standard OpenFOAM modules?",
    "answer": "No, our OpenFOAM modules don't include the petscFoam solver, but it can be compiled on any of our clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is necessary for OpenFOAM and PETSc versions when using the petscFoam solver?",
    "answer": "The versions of OpenFOAM and PETSc need to be compatible."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some examples of compatible OpenFOAM and PETSc version combinations?",
    "answer": "Compatible combinations include `openfoam/v2412` with `petsc/3.21.6` and `openfoam/v2312` with `petsc/3.20.0`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can one check which minor release of PETSc is compatible with a specific OpenFOAM version?",
    "answer": "To check compatible PETSc versions, load the desired OpenFOAM module and run the `grep \"^petsc_version\" $EBROOTOPENFOAM/OpenFOAM*/etc/config.sh/petsc` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the configuration script, what version of PETSc was `openfoam/v2412` tested with?",
    "answer": "`openfoam/v2412` was tested with PETSc 3.21.2."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is `petsc/3.21.6` considered compatible with OpenFOAM that was tested with `petsc-3.21.2`?",
    "answer": "`petsc/3.21.6` is from the same 3.21 release branch and should only contain bugfixes compared to 3.21.2."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules need to be loaded to begin compiling the petscFoam solver?",
    "answer": "To begin compiling the petscFoam solver, you need to load `StdEnv/2023`, `gcc/12.3`, `openmpi/4.1.5`, `openfoam/v2412`, and `petsc/3.21.6`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the next step after loading modules to compile the petscFoam solver?",
    "answer": "Next, you need to download the `external-solver-main.tar.gz` package using `wget https://develop.openfoam.com/modules/external-solver/-/archive/main/external-solver-main.tar.gz`."
  },
  {
    "question": "After downloading the `external-solver-main.tar.gz` package, what is the subsequent step for compiling petscFoam?",
    "answer": "After downloading, you need to extract the `external-solver-main.tar.gz` package using `tar xvfz external-solver-main.tar.gz`."
