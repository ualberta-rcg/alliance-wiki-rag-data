    "question": "How can I copy a directory or file locally into a project directory using `cp`?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `cp -rv --preserve=\"mode,timestamps\" LOCALNAME ~/projects/def-professor/someuser/somedir/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key difference between `cp` and `rsync` when copying a directory to a new destination?",
    "answer": "Unlike `rsync`, if `LOCALNAME` is a directory, `cp` will rename it to `somedir` if `somedir` does not already exist."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should checksums be used to verify if files match between two systems?",
    "answer": "Checksums should be used if Globus is unavailable between the two systems being synchronized and Rsync is taking too long."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which checksum utility is provided as an example in the document?",
    "answer": "`sha1sum` is used as an example checksum utility."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you generate checksums for all files in a specific directory and save them to a log file?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `find /home/username/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sha1sum | tee checksum-result.log`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the output of the `find` and `sha1sum` command used for generating checksums?",
    "answer": "The command creates a new file named `checksum-result.log` in the current directory, containing all checksums for files in `/home/username/`, and also prints the checksums to the screen."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is recommended for running a checksum generation command with many or large files to prevent interruption from SSH timeouts?",
    "answer": "For many or very large files, it is recommended to run the command in the background within a `screen` or `tmux` session to ensure it continues if the SSH connection times out."
  },
  {
    "question": "After generating checksum logs on two systems, what utility can be used to identify files that do not match?",
    "answer": "The `diff` utility can be used to find files that don't match by comparing the checksum logs from both systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to compare two checksum log files?",
    "answer": "The command is `diff checksum-result-silo.log checksum-dtn.log`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might comparing checksum logs with `diff` produce false differences, and what is the solution?",
    "answer": "False differences might occur because the `find` command could crawl directories in a different order. To resolve this, `sort -k2` should be run on both checksum files before running `diff`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you sort a checksum log file by its second column and save the sorted output back to the same file?",
    "answer": "You can use the command `sort -k2 checksum-result-silo.log -o checksum-result-silo.log`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does SFTP stand for, and what protocol does it use for data transfer?",
    "answer": "SFTP stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol and uses the SSH protocol to encrypt data being transferred between machines."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you initiate an SFTP connection to a remote machine using a username and address?",
    "answer": "You can connect using the command `sftp USERNAME@ADDRESS`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the command to connect to an SFTP server using an SSH key for authentication?",
    "answer": "You can connect using the `-i` option with the path to your private key, for example: `sftp -i /home/name/.ssh/id_rsa USERNAME@ADDRESS`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I view the available commands once connected to an SFTP prompt?",
    "answer": "Enter the `help` command at the `sftp>` prompt."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some graphical SFTP programs recommended for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS?",
    "answer": "WinSCP and MobaXterm are recommended for Windows; FileZilla works on Windows, Mac, and Linux; and Cyberduck is available for Mac and Windows."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does SCP stand for, and what protocol does it use for encrypting data transfers?",
    "answer": "SCP stands for Secure Copy Protocol and uses the SSH protocol to encrypt data being transferred."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does SCP offer file synchronization capabilities?",
    "answer": "No, SCP does not support synchronization like Globus or rsync."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you copy a local file to a remote directory on a cluster using SCP?",
    "answer": "To copy a local file like `foo.txt` to the `$HOME/work` directory on the `rorqual` cluster, use the command `scp foo.txt username@rorqual.alliancecan.ca:work/`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I copy a file from a remote cluster's project space to my local computer using SCP?",
    "answer": "To copy `output.dat` from a project space on the `Fir` cluster to your current local directory, use the command `scp username@fir.alliancecan.ca:projects/def-jdoe/username/results/output.dat .`."
