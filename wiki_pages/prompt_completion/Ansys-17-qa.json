    "question": "What modules are required to run Ansys Fluids applications (Fluent, CFX5, ICEMCFD) on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You need to load `CcEnv StdEnv/2023` followed by an Ansys version like `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you start Fluent, CFX5, or ICEMCFD applications on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "After loading the necessary modules, use the command `unset SESSION_MANAGER` followed by `fluent | cfx5 | icemcfd`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is `unset SESSION_MANAGER` used when starting Ansys Fluids applications on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "It prevents the 'Qt: Session management error: None of the authentication protocols specified are supported' message from appearing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you fix the 'Error segmentation violation' popup when starting ICEMCFD on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Do not click the 'OK' button on the popup. Instead, go to the Settings Tab, select Display, tick X11, click Apply, then OK, and finally File -> Exit. The error popup should no longer appear when ICEMCFD is restarted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are needed to run Ansys Mapdl on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You should load `CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and then specify an Ansys version like `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you start the Ansys Mapdl GUI directly on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "After loading the required modules, use the command `mapdl -g`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you start Ansys Mapdl via its launcher on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "After loading the required modules, use `unset SESSION_MANAGER; launcher` and then click the 'RUN' button."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules should be loaded to run Ansys Workbench versions 2024R2.04 or older using `SnEnv` on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "Load `SnEnv` and then `ansys/2024R2.04` (or older versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do `runwb2` and `runwb2-gui` differ in license server usage when using `SnEnv` modules for Workbench on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "The `runwb2` command uses the SHARCNET license server by default, while `runwb2-gui` reads your `~/.licenses/ansys.lic` file and offers an interactive option to use the CMC server."
  },
  {
    "question": "What modules are required to run Ansys Workbench versions 2025R1 or newer using `CcEnv StdEnv/2023` on VDI nodes?",
    "answer": "You need to load `CcEnv StdEnv/2023` and then `ansys/2025R1` (or newer versions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the 'Warning: Software rasterizer found, hardware acceleration will be disabled.' message be prevented when starting Fluent from Workbench 2025R1?",
    "answer": "Before starting Fluent, go to the Environment tab in the Fluent Launcher panel and paste `HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` into the empty input box. Alternatively, set `export HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl` in your environment before starting Workbench."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended core and memory limits for running Ansys Mechanical in Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "For Ansys Mechanical, tick 'Distributed' in the Solver panel, specify a maximum of 24 cores, and do not use more than 128GB of memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the recommended core and memory limits for running Ansys Fluent in Workbench on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "For Ansys Fluent, untick 'Distributed', specify a maximum of 12 cores, and do not use more than 128GB of memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many cores should be used for pre-processing or post-processing work with Ansys Workbench on gra-vdi if no calculations are being run?",
    "answer": "Only 4 cores should be used for pre-processing or post-processing work to avoid checking out unnecessary HPC licenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What command can be used to terminate all Ansys processes if programs freeze or do not start correctly on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "Open a new terminal window on gra-vdi and run `pkill -9 -e -u $USER -f \"ansys|fluent|mwrpcss|mwfwrapper|ENGINE|mono\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What step should be taken if Ansys problems persist on gra-vdi after killing processes, especially if you have worked in the GUI on compute nodes previously?",
    "answer": "Try running `rm -rf .ansys` if you have been working in the GUI on compute nodes before working on gra-vdi."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the status of Ansys 2025R1 module compatibility with the SHARCNET license server on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "The Ansys 2025R1 module is not usable with the SHARCNET license server until an upgrade is completed, expected early August 2025."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are GUI interfaces for programs like Ansys Mechanical in Ansys 2025R1 fully functional on gra-vdi?",
    "answer": "No, the GUI interfaces for some programs available in Ansys 2025R1, such as Ansys Mechanical, do not work properly on gra-vdi and will not be fixed because gra-vdi is scheduled for retirement soon."
