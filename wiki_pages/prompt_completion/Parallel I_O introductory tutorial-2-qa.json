    "question": "What parallel filesystem is commonly used on national systems?",
    "answer": "Lustre, an open-source filesystem, is commonly run on national systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of a parallel filesystem?",
    "answer": "The purpose of a parallel filesystem is to maintain logical partitions and provide efficient access to data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What software layer is found on top of the parallel filesystem?",
    "answer": "I/O middleware is found on top of the parallel filesystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key functions of I/O middleware?",
    "answer": "I/O middleware organizes access from many processes by optimizing two-phase I/O, disk I/O, and data flow over the network. It also provides data sieving by converting many small non-contiguous I/O requests into fewer/bigger requests."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some examples of high-end I/O libraries?",
    "answer": "High-end I/O libraries include HDF5 and NetCDF."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do high-end I/O libraries function in relation to application code and storage?",
    "answer": "High-end I/O libraries map application abstractions to storage abstractions in terms of the data structures of the code, storing data directly to disk efficiently."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which I/O middleware is a part of the MPI-2 standard?",
    "answer": "MPI-IO is the I/O middleware that is a part of the MPI-2 standard."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do national systems' parallel filesystems achieve scalability for computing nodes?",
    "answer": "Parallel filesystems on national systems are designed to scale to tens of thousands of computing nodes efficiently."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can files be optimized for better performance in a parallel filesystem?",
    "answer": "For better performance, files can be striped across multiple drives, meaning a file resides on multiple drives so that multiple drives can concurrently handle read/write operations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do parallel file systems manage concurrent file access by multiple processes?",
    "answer": "Parallel file systems use locks to manage concurrent file access, where files are pieced into 'lock' units scattered across multiple hard drives, and client nodes obtain locks on units they access before I/O occurs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of files are parallel filesystems optimized for?",
    "answer": "The parallel filesystem is optimized for storing large shared files which can be possibly accessible from many computing nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of file storage performs poorly on parallel filesystems?",
    "answer": "Storing many small size files shows very poor performance on parallel filesystems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a strong recommendation for users regarding small files on national systems?",
    "answer": "Users are strongly recommended not to generate millions of small size files."
  },
  {
    "question": "What user activities can negatively impact the performance of a shared file system for all users?",
    "answer": "How you read and write, your file format, the number of files in a directory, and how often you use commands like `ls` can affect every user, and heavy I/O can hurt process communications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the inherent limitations of file systems?",
    "answer": "File systems are limited in terms of bandwidth, IOPs (I/O operations per second), number of files, and space."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the first best practice for I/O in HPC?",
    "answer": "It is always recommended to make a plan for your data needs, such as how much will be generated, how much you need to save, and where to keep it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do national systems have different quotas for file systems?",
    "answer": "Yes, on national systems, different file systems (home, project, scratch) have different quotas."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a characteristic of scratch data on national systems?",
    "answer": "Scratch data is subject to expiry."
  },
  {
    "question": "What file system commands should be used sparingly in directories with many files?",
    "answer": "Users should minimize the use of `ls` or `du` commands, especially in a directory with many files."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can users monitor their disk usage?",
    "answer": "Users can check their disk usage regularly with the `quota` command."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are warning signs regarding file count and size that should prompt careful consideration?",
    "answer": "Warning signs include having more than 100,000 files in your space and an average data file size less than 100MB (if writing lots of data)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'housekeeping' in the context of file management, and what tools are popular for it?",
    "answer": "'Housekeeping' involves regularly maintaining a reasonable number of files and managing quota, with `gzip` and `tar` commands being very popular to compress and group multiple files."
