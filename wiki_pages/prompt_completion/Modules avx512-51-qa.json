  {
    "question": "What is IMPUTE 5?",
    "answer": "IMPUTE 5 is a genotype imputation method that can scale to reference panels with millions of samples. It refines the IMPUTE2 method by using a custom subset of haplotypes for individual imputation, achieving fast, accurate, and memory-efficient imputation through Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT)."

    "answer": "The available version for impute5 is 1.1.5."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does IMPUTE5 achieve high performance compared to other imputation software?",
    "answer": "IMPUTE5 is up to 30x faster than MINIMAC4 and up to 3x faster than BEAGLE5.1 by using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT) for selecting locally best matching haplotypes and long identical by state segments."
