    "question": "How can Abaqus calculations be performed using MPI across multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "If you have a license for tasks requiring a lot of memory and computing, a provided script can perform the calculation with MPI using an arbitrary set of nodes, ideally determined automatically by the scheduler."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is a restart script model provided for multi-node Abaqus tasks?",
    "answer": "No, a model script for restarting multi-node tasks is not provided as its use presents additional limitations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the required Slurm parameters for an Abaqus MPI job on multiple nodes?",
    "answer": "The Slurm parameters include `--account=def-group`, `--time=00-06:00`, `--ntasks=8`, `--mem-per-cpu=4G`, and `--cpus-per-task=1` (which should not be changed). `--nodes` and `--tasks-per-node` are optional."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which modules should be loaded for an Abaqus MPI job?",
    "answer": "You should load `StdEnv/2020` and `abaqus/2021`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the `mp_host_list` generated for an Abaqus MPI job?",
    "answer": "The `mp_host_list` is generated using `slurm_hl2hl.py` to get the hostlist, which is then processed to create a list of nodes and their core counts, formatted as `mp_host_list` and exported."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Abaqus command to run an MPI simulation?",
    "answer": "The command is `abaqus job=testsp1-mpi input=mystd-sim.inp scratch=$SLURM_TMPDIR cpus=$SLURM_NTASKS interactive mp_mode=mpi`."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does Abaqus explicit analysis support parallelization?",
    "answer": "Yes, Abaqus explicit analysis solvers support parallelization with threads and MPI."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are restart scripts available for multi-node explicit analysis tasks?",
    "answer": "Model scripts for restarting multi-node explicit analysis tasks are not presented for now, as they require more testing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the typical Slurm parameters for a single-node Abaqus explicit analysis job?",
    "answer": "Typical Slurm parameters for a single-node explicit analysis job include `--account=def-group`, `--time=00-06:00`, `--mem=8000M`, `--cpus-per-task=4`, and `--nodes=1`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you specify writing restart data for a total of 12 increments in an Abaqus explicit analysis input file?",
    "answer": "The input file must contain `*RESTART, WRITE, OVERLAY, NUMBER INTERVAL=12, TIME MARKS=NO`."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you verify restart information for an Abaqus explicit analysis?",
    "answer": "You can verify restart information by running `egrep -i \"step|restart\" testep*.com testep*.msg testep*.sta`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What Abaqus command is used to run a single-node explicit analysis simulation in thread mode?",
    "answer": "The command is `abaqus job=testep1 input=myexp-sim.inp scratch=$SLURM_TMPDIR cpus=$SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE interactive mp_mode=threads memory=\"$((${SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE}-3072))MB\"`."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Abaqus command to restart an explicit analysis job from a previous run in a project directory?",
    "answer": "The command is `abaqus job=testep2 input=myexp-sim.inp recover scratch=$SLURM_TMPDIR cpus=$SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE interactive mp_mode=threads memory=\"$((${SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE}-3072))MB\"` after copying relevant files from the old job to the new job's naming convention."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the input file require modifications for restarting an explicit analysis?",
    "answer": "No, the input file does not require any modification for restarting the explicit analysis."
