    "question": "What is Comet?",
    "answer": "Comet is a meta machine learning platform designed to help AI practitioners and teams build reliable machine learning models for real-world applications by streamlining the machine learning model lifecycle."
  },
  {
    "question": "What capabilities does Comet offer to users?",
    "answer": "By using Comet, users can track, compare, explain, and reproduce their machine learning experiments."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Comet help with hyperparameter search?",
    "answer": "Comet can greatly accelerate hyperparameter search by providing a module for the Bayesian exploration of hyperparameter space."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is Comet's availability restricted on compute nodes?",
    "answer": "Comet's availability is restricted on compute nodes because it requires an internet connection."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which clusters require `module load httpproxy` to use Comet?",
    "answer": "`module load httpproxy` is required for using Comet on Narval, Rorqual, and TamIA clusters."
  },
  {
    "question": "On which clusters is Comet available without needing `httpproxy`?",
    "answer": "Comet is available on Fir, Nibi, Vulcan, and Killarney clusters, and `httpproxy` is not required for them."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Comet available on the Trillium cluster?",
    "answer": "No, Comet is not available on the Trillium cluster because internet access is disabled on its compute nodes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended frequency for logging metrics or requesting new hyperparameters with Comet?",
    "answer": "As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to log metrics (or request new hyperparameters) at an interval of 1 minute or greater."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the potential impact of logging metrics at a high frequency with Comet?",
    "answer": "Logging metrics at a high frequency can cause Comet to throttle your experiment, which can make your job duration harder to predict."
