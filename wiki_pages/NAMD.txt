<!--T:24-->
[http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/ NAMD] is a parallel, object-oriented molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. 
Simulation preparation and analysis is integrated into the [[VMD]] visualization package.


= Installation = <!--T:22-->
NAMD is installed by our software team and is available as a module.  If a new version is required or if for some reason you need to do your own installation, please contact [[Technical support]].  You can also ask for details of how our NAMD modules were compiled.

= Environment modules = <!--T:4-->

<!--T:48-->
The latest version of NAMD is 3.0.1 and it has been installed on all clusters.  The previous version 2.14 is also available.

<!--T:49-->
Older versions 2.13 and 2.12 are also available.

<!--T:50-->
To run jobs that span nodes, use UCX.

= Submission scripts = <!--T:13-->

<!--T:14-->
Please refer to the [[Running jobs]] page for help on using the SLURM workload manager.

== Serial and threaded jobs == <!--T:15-->
Below is a simple job script for a serial simulation (using only one core).  You can increase the number for --cpus-per-task to use more cores, up to the maximum number of cores available on a cluster node.

== Parallel CPU jobs == <!--T:61-->

=== MPI jobs === <!--T:18-->
'''NOTE''': MPI should not be used.  Instead use UCX.  

=== Verbs jobs === <!--T:16-->

<!--T:51-->
NOTE: For NAMD 2.14, use UCX. Instructions below apply only to NAMD versions 2.13 and 2.12.

<!--T:52-->
These provisional instructions will be refined further once this configuration can be fully tested on the new clusters.
This example uses 64 processes in total on 2 nodes, each node running 32 processes, thus fully utilizing its 32 cores.  This script assumes full nodes are used, thus <code>ntasks-per-node</code> should be 32 (on Graham).  For best performance, NAMD jobs should use full nodes.

<!--T:17-->
'''NOTES''':
*Verbs versions will not run on Cedar because of its different interconnect; use the MPI version instead.
*Verbs versions will not run on Béluga either because of its incompatible infiniband kernel drivers; use the UCX version instead.

== Parallel GPU jobs == <!--T:44-->
=== UCX GPU jobs ===
This example is for Béluga and it assumes that full nodes are used, which gives best performance for NAMD jobs. It uses 8 processes in total on 2 nodes, each process(task) using 10 threads and 1 GPU.   This fully utilizes Béluga GPU nodes which have 40 cores and 4 GPUs per node.  Note that 1 core per task has to be reserved for a communications thread, so NAMD will report that only 72 cores are being used but this is normal.  

<!--T:45-->
To use this script on other clusters, please look up the specifications of their available nodes and adjust --cpus-per-task and --gpus-per-node options accordingly.

= Performance and benchmarking= <!--T:31-->

<!--T:71-->
A team at [https://www.ace-net.ca/ ACENET] has created a [https://mdbench.ace-net.ca/mdbench/ Molecular Dynamics Performance Guide] for Alliance clusters.
It can help you determine optimal conditions for AMBER, GROMACS, NAMD, and OpenMM jobs. The present section focuses on NAMD performance.

<!--T:32-->
Here is an example of how you should conduct benchmarking of NAMD.  Performance of NAMD will be different for different systems you are simulating, depending especially on the number of atoms in the simulation.  Therefore, if you plan to spend a significant amount of time simulating a particular system, it would be very useful to conduct the kind of benchmarking shown below.  Collecting and providing this kind of data is also very useful if you are applying for a RAC award.

<!--T:33-->
For a good benchmark, vary the number of steps so that your system runs for a few minutes, and that timing information is collected in reasonable time intervals of at least a few seconds.  If your run is too short, you might see fluctuations in your timing results.  

<!--T:34-->
The numbers below were obtained for the standard NAMD apoa1 benchmark.  The benchmarking was conducted on the Graham cluster, which has CPU nodes with 32 cores and GPU nodes with 32 cores and 2 GPUs.  Performing the benchmark on other clusters will have to take account of the different structure of their nodes.

<!--T:35-->
In the results shown in the first table below, we used NAMD 2.12 from the verbs module. Efficiency is computed from  (time with 1 core) / (N * (time with N cores) ).

<!--T:36-->
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! # cores !! Wall time (s) per step !! Efficiency
|-
| 1 ||  0.8313||100%
|-
| 2 ||  0.4151||100%
|-
| 4 ||  0.1945|| 107%
|-
| 8 ||   0.0987|| 105%
|-
| 16 ||   0.0501|| 104%
|-
| 32   ||    0.0257|| 101%
|-
| 64 ||  0.0133|| 98%
|-
| 128 || 0.0074|| 88%
|-
| 256 || 0.0036|| 90%
|-
| 512 || 0.0021|| 77%
|-
|}

<!--T:37-->
These results show that for this system it is acceptable to use up to 256 cores.  Keep in mind that if you ask for more cores, your jobs will wait in the queue for a longer time, affecting your overall throughput.

<!--T:38-->
Now we perform benchmarking with GPUs.  NAMD multicore module is used for simulations that fit within 1 node, and NAMD verbs-smp module is used for runs spanning nodes.

<!--T:39-->
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! # cores !! #GPUs !! Wall time (s) per step !! Notes
|-
| 4 || 1   ||  0.0165 || 1 node, multicore
|-
| 8 || 1   || 0.0088 || 1 node, multicore
|-
| 16 || 1   || 0.0071 || 1 node, multicore
|-
| 32   || 2   ||  0.0045  || 1 node, multicore
|-
| 64 || 4 || 0.0058  || 2 nodes, verbs-smp
|-
| 128 || 8 ||  0.0051 || 2 nodes, verbs-smp
|-
|}

<!--T:40-->
From this table it is clear that there is no point at all in using more than 1 node for this system, since performance actually becomes worse if we use 2 or more nodes.  Using only 1 node, it is best to use 1GPU/16 core as that has the greatest efficiency, but also acceptable to use 2GPU/32core if you need to get your results quickly.  Since on Graham GPU nodes your priority is charged the same for any job using up to 16 cores and 1 GPU, there is no benefit from running with 8 cores and 4 cores in this case.

<!--T:41-->
Finally, you have to ask whether to run with or without GPUs for this simulation.  From our numbers we can see that using a full GPU node of Graham (32 cores, 2 gpus) the job runs faster than it would on 4 non-GPU nodes of Graham.  Since a GPU node on Graham costs about twice what a non-GPU node costs, in this case it is more cost effective to run with GPUs.  You should run with GPUs if possible, however, given that there are fewer GPU than CPU nodes, you may need to consider submitting non-GPU jobs if your waiting time for GPU jobs is too long.

= NAMD 3 = <!--T:63-->

<!--T:64-->
NAMD 3.0.1 is now installed as a module.  It might offer better performance than NAMD 2.14 for certain system configurations.

<!--T:65-->
Sometimes a newer version of NAMD will become available on the NAMD website, but it might take us a while to install it as a module. If you want to try it right away, you can download the binary from the NAMD website and modify it so it can run on Alliance systems, like this (change version as needed):

</translate>
 tar xvfz NAMD_3.0alpha11_Linux-x86_64-multicore-CUDA-SingleNode.tar.gz 
 cd NAMD_3.0alpha11_Linux-x86_64-multicore-CUDA
 setrpaths.sh  --path .
<translate>

<!--T:67-->
After this the <code>namd3</code> executable located in that directory will be linked to the correct libraries on our systems.
You can then submit a job that uses that executable.

<!--T:68-->
For best performance of NAMD 3 on GPUs, we highly recommend adding the following keyword to the configuration file, if the input configuration you are running supports it.

</translate>
 GPUresident on;
