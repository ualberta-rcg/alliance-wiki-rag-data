Users must register with the [https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/security/login CCDB portal] in order to access the resources hosted across Canada by the Alliance and its regional partners, collectively known as the Alliance Federation. ﻿CCDB is a gateway to account and allocation information for Advanced Computing Platform managed through the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (the Alliance). The CCDB was established to share information between the Alliance and its regional partners and users can access all of the available resources with their CCDB account. 

<!--T:2-->
Any faculty member at a Canadian university is eligible to register and, once registered, can sponsor the students, research staff and collaborators working on their research projects.

<!--T:3-->
Researchers coming from government, non-profits, and industry may also be eligible to use Federation resources. These inquiries should be directed to accounts@tech.alliancecan.ca.

<!--T:4-->
Please note:
* ''The instructions below only apply if you are registering with the Alliance for the first time.'' 
* If you already have a CCDB account, even if it is deactivated, you do not need to apply for a new account again. Read the Account Renewals FAQ.

<!--T:5-->
==User roles==
The CCDB has 12 classifications of roles, which can be seen on the registration page. Visit the [[User roles to access resources and services of the Alliance Federation|User Roles]] page for descriptions and key characteristics of each available role.

<!--T:6-->
Principal Investigators (PIs) must register with the CCDB first. The approval process can take up to 2 business days. When a CCDB registration has been approved, a confirmation email will be sent that includes your Role Identifier (CCRI). Once a PI has their CCRI, all of their Group Members can register in the CCDB.

<!--T:7-->
Group Members follow the same registration process as PI but a Group Member must indicate their sponsor’s CCRI and does not need to provide information about the research area. All Group Members must be approved by a sponsor. Sponsors will receive an email requiring them to confirm each Group Member once the Group Member has completed the first step of the registration process. New sponsored role requests pending for approval will also show on the CCDB home page of the PI.
