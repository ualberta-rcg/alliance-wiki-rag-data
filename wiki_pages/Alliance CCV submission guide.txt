== General information == <!--T:1-->

<!--T:2-->
=== What is the Canadian Common CV? ===
The Canadian Common CV (CCV) is a Canadian Institutes of Health Research-funded (CIHR) software system aimed at standardizing CV submissions to granting agencies for funding competitions. CCV is currently used by a number of major funding agencies, including NSERC, SSHRC, NCE, and CIHR itself, as well as the Alliance.

<!--T:3-->
=== Why does the Alliance require a CCV? ===
We require all faculty users to submit a CCV for the following:

<!--T:4-->
* '''To renew your Alliance account:''' This is required for all users with Faculty and Adjunct Faculty roles, with the exception of Emeritus Professors, Librarians and Retired Faculty, for whom submitting a CCV is optional.
* '''To apply for the Resource Allocation Competitions (RAC):''' An updated CCV is required for the Principal Investigator (PI) and ALL the co-PIs of a RAC application.

<!--T:5-->
'''Please note:'''

<!--T:6-->
* A message in the Alliance account renewal online form will indicate whether the submission of the CCV is mandatory or optional in each case.

<!--T:7-->
* Emeritus Professors, Retired Faculty and Librarians may choose not to submit a CCV when renewing their account. However, submission of the CCV '''is mandatory''' for ALL PIs and Co-PIs of a RAC application.

<!--T:8-->
PIs can update their CCV at any time by going to ''My Account → [https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/reporting View Reporting]'' on CCDB.

<!--T:9-->
=== Who should I contact for support? ===
If you forgot your CCV username or password, or if you need technical support to access <nowiki>https://ccv-cvc.ca/</nowiki>, please contact the CCV helpdesk directly by email at support@cihr-irsc.gc.ca or by phone at 613-954-1968 or 1-888-603-4178.

<!--T:10-->
If you have specific questions about the information required in the Alliance CCV template, or if you have issues submitting your CCV to the Alliance, please contact us at support@tech.alliancecan.ca.

<!--T:11-->
We provide support '''only''' for Alliance account holders that need to submit a CCV to renew an account or apply for RAC. If you are not an Alliance account holder, please contact the agency to which you are trying to submit a CCV directly.

<!--T:12-->
=== Who should submit a CCV? ===
The CCV is mandatory for all university Faculty that want to renew their Alliance account and submit an application to any of our Resource Allocation Competitions (RAC). Note that only users with active CCDB accounts will be able to submit applications to the RAC. 

<!--T:13-->
== Register for a CCV account ==
''If you already have a CCV account, skip this step.''

<!--T:14-->
# Go to https://ccv-cvc.ca/
# Click on your preferred language.
# Click on the ''Login'' button at the top right-hand corner of the window.

<!--T:15-->
== Submit an Alliance CCV ==
Submitting your CCV requires you to add and update items to your CV, and then submit explicitly to the Alliance template. Any items you add or update while filling out an Alliance CCV will be added to your generic CCV for future use, e.g. for submitting to other granting agencies. 

<!--T:16-->
''Before following the next steps, ensure that you are logged in to the CCV site.''

<!--T:17-->
# In the top menu bar, select ''CV''.

# Each row with a green checkmark indicates that the information provided meets Alliance’s criteria for submission.
# Each row with a red x-mark indicates that contents is missing. Click on the pencil icon to edit the information. The CCV interface will inform you which fields are missing or filled out incorrectly.
# To preview your CCV submission, click on the ''Preview'' button.
# To begin the submission process, click on the ''Submit'' button.
# Make note of the '''confirmation number''' you are assigned upon submission. It is mandatory to enter this number on the CCDB to link your RAC application with your CCV submission. 
#* '''Important:''' Only confirmation numbers for CCVs submitted using the '''Alliance''' template will be accepted. You cannot use confirmation numbers for other CCV templates that you may already have (e.g., NSERC, CIHR, etc.) 
# Agree to the consent terms and confirm your submission.[[File:Updated screen shot 2022-06-08 at 7.34.48 am 1.png|none|thumb|451x451px]]

== Renew your Alliance account - Faculty only ==
Only users with Faculty and Adjunct Faculty roles are required to submit a CCV to renew their Alliance account.

<!--T:21-->
* '''Important:''' Submitting a CCV to renew an account is only optional for Emeritus Professors, Retired Faculty and Librarians. If you do not wish to submit a CCV, please send an email to support@tech.alliancecancomputecanada.ca. 

<!--T:22-->
To renew your account, your CCV must have been submitted in the last 300 days. 

<!--T:23-->
# Click on https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/account_renewal.

<!--T:24-->
If you have further questions about the renewals process, please visit our [[Account renewal FAQ|Renewals FAQ]] page. 

<!--T:25-->
== Apply to the Resource Allocation Competitions ==
An updated CCV is required for the Academic Principal Investigator (PI) and ALL the co-PIs of a RAC application. 

<!--T:26-->
'''Important:''' Since faculty are required to update their CCV to renew Alliance accounts in the spring, most Academic PIs will have an updated their CCV when submitting a RAC application in the fall. In this case, submitting a new CCV (e.g., because new information was added to the CCV since the spring) is at the discretion of the PI.

<!--T:27-->
If you have further questions, please visit the [[Account renewal FAQ|Resource Allocation Competitions]] (RAC) page. 

<!--T:28-->
=== Academic Principal Investigator of a RAC application ===
'''Note:''' if you have delegated your application to a sponsored user, have the delegated person follow the steps below to submit on your behalf.

<!--T:29-->
# Navigate to the Resource Application page on CCDB: https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/allocation/resource_applications
# Under the Resource Allocation Competitions section, go to the ''Ongoing Competitions'' tab and click on ''Apply'' in the corresponding RRG or RPP section to start a new application, or click on ''Edit'' to continue working on an already created application.
# In the application form, scroll down to the ''Canadian Common CV'' section.

#* If you are absolutely sure that your CCV submission was successful and the parameters you have entered are correct, yet you receive an error on CCDB, please contact support@tech.alliancecancomputecanada.ca for assistance.
# Report contributions enabled by our computational resources (see instructions in '''Section 6''' of this document).

<!--T:30-->
=== Co-Principal Investigator of a RAC application ===
All Co-PIs of the RAC application must have an updated CCV on file. This means that CCVs on file must have been submitted within the last 90 days. The Academic PI will not be able to submit their RAC application until all the CCVs meet this requirement.

<!--T:31-->
In the RAC application form, the PI will be able to see the status of the CCV for each of the Co-PIs included in the application, as well as the action required (if any). 
[[File:Not changed co-pi ccv status en.png|none|thumb|478x478px]]



<!--T:32-->
Co-PIs can update their CCV in any of the two following ways: 

<!--T:33-->
'''In the Resource Applications page'''

<!--T:34-->
# In the Resource Applications menu, click on Resource Applications.
# Under the ''Ongoing Competitions'' tab, navigate to the application where you are listed ''As a Co-PI of''
# Click on ''Update CCV''.

<!--T:35-->
'''In the Reporting page'''

<!--T:36-->
# In the ''My Account'' menu, click on [https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/reporting ''View reporting'']''.''
# Follow the instructions.

<!--T:37-->
== Report Publications enabled by our computational Resources ==
Please note that the more publications we can report, the stronger the case we can build to advocate for additional compute and storage resources. The CCV is also one of the inputs of the scientific review process for RAC applications.

<!--T:38-->
=== Academic PI submitting a new CCV ===
Once you submit a new CCV (either because you are doing it for the first time or submitting an updated CCV), the publications included in your Alliance CCV template will show in the ''CCV Publications Reporting'' section of the CCV submission form on CCDB surrounded by a red square.
[[File:Screen shot 2022-06-15 at 11.55.50 am.png|none|thumb|496x496px]]

<!--T:39-->
# When a new CCV is uploaded, publications for which you have not yet provided an answer are surrounded by a red border. In order to submit your RAC application, '''you must provide an answer for all publications''': there should be no red borders left once you complete this process. 
# Check the box next to each publication to clear the red border one-by-one or simply click ''Select all new'' to mark all of your publications as enabled by our resources.
# Click on the ''Clear all new'' button if none of the new publications uploaded were enabled by our computational resources.

<!--T:40-->
'''Important''': If you choose not to use the ''Select all'' or ''Clear all'' buttons, but instead prefer to go over your publications one-by-one, please note that you have to click twice on a publication to mark it as not enabled by our resources:

<!--T:41-->
* the first time you click on it, a check mark indicates that the publication was enabled by our resources;
* the second time you click on the same publication, the check mark is removed thus indicating that the publication was not enabled by our resources.

=== Academic PI with an existing CCV on file === <!--T:42--> 

<!--T:43-->
==== CCV uploaded within the last 3 months ====
If the version of the CCV that we have on file was updated within the previous 90 days, submitting a new one (e.g. adding new publications) with your RAC application is ''optional''. In this case, CCDB will show your latest CCV available on file, the date when it was last submitted and your selection of publications enabled by our resources. 

<!--T:44-->
==== CCV is older than 3 months ====
If your CCV on file is older than 90 days, you will be required to submit a new CCV with your RAC application. 

<!--T:45-->
# Go to the CCV website, make changes as needed to the Alliance CCV template and submit when ready.
# Enter the new CCV confirmation code on CCDB and click on ''Update CCV''.[[File:Updated screen shot 2022-06-10 at 9.39.40 am.png|none|thumb|457x457px]]
# Once the new CCV has been successfully uploaded, you will see the list of publications included in the most recently submitted CCV, showing the CC enabled publications enabled by our computational resources as you marked them the last time you submitted your CCV.
## If you have added new publications to your Alliance CCV (compared to the ones that we have on file), CCDB will remember your previously reported publications and will mark with a red border only the recently added ones. In this case, you only need to click on the ones with the red border.
## Since publications are shown in chronological order (most recent at the top), please scroll down to make sure that you have checked (as applicable) all the new publications with a red border. Otherwise, the reporting process will be incomplete and you will not be able to submit your application.

<!--T:46-->
'''Important:''' You have to click twice on a new publication to identify it as not enabled by our computational resources. The first time you click on the new publication, a check mark indicates that it was enabled by our resources; the second time you click on the same box, the check mark is removed, thus indicating that the new publication was not enabled by our resources.
