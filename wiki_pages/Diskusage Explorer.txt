<!--T:3-->
You can get a breakdown by folder of how the disk space is being consumed in your /home, /scratch and /project spaces. That information is currently updated once a day and is stored in an [[SQLite]] format for fast access. 

<!--T:4-->
Here is how to explore your disk consumption, using the example of /project space <code>def-professor</code> as the particular directory to investigate.

<!--T:5-->
=== ncurse user interface ===
Choose a /project space you have access to and want to analyze; for the purpose of this discussion we will use <tt>def-professor</tt>.
{{Command|diskusage_explorer /project/def-professor}}
This command loads a browser that shows the resources consumed by all files under any directory tree.

<br clear=all> <!-- This is to prevent the next section from filling to the right of the image. -->

<!--T:6-->
Type <code>c</code> to toggle between consumed disk space and the number of files, <code>q</code> or <code><esc></code> to quit and <code>h</code> for help.

<!--T:7-->
If you are only interested in a subdirectory of this /project space and do not want to navigate the whole tree in the ncurse user interface, use 
{{Command|diskusage_explorer /project/def-professor/subdirectory/}}

<!--T:8-->
A complete manual page is available with the <code>man duc</code> command.

=== Graphical user interface === <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
Note that when the login node is especially busy or if you have an especially large number of files in your /project space, the graphical interface mode can be slow and choppy. For a better experience, you can read the section below to run <code>diskusage_explorer</code> on your own machine.

<!--T:11-->
Note that we recommend the use of the standard text-based ncurse mode on our cluster login nodes but <code>diskusage_explorer</code> does also include a nice graphical user interface (GUI). 

<!--T:12-->
First, make sure that you are connected to the cluster in such a way that [[SSH]] is capable of correctly displaying GUI applications. You can then use a graphical interface by means of the command,
{{Command|duc gui -d /project/.duc_databases/def-professor.sqlite  /project/def-professor}}

<!--T:13-->
You can navigate the folders with the mouse and still type <code>c</code> to toggle between the size of the files and the number of files.

<!--T:14-->

<br clear=all> <!-- This is to prevent the next section from filling to the right of the image. -->

=== Browse faster on your own machine === <!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
First, [http://duc.zevv.nl/#download install the diskusage_explorer software] on your local machine and then, still on your local machine, download the SQLite file from your cluster and run <code>duc</code>.  

<!--T:17-->
<pre>
rsync -v --progress username@beluga.calculcanada.ca:/project/.duc_databases/def-professor.sqlite  .
duc gui -d ./def-professor.sqlite  /project/def-professor
</pre>

<!--T:18-->
This immediately leads to a smoother and more satisfying browsing experience.

== Space and file count usage per user on Cedar ==
{{Outdated}}

<!--T:20-->
On Cedar, it is possible for any member of a group to run <code>diskusage_report</code> with the following options <code>--per_user</code> and <code>--all_users</code> to have the breakdown per user. The first option displays only heavy users. In other terms, members of the group who have more files and/or occupy more space. When both options are used, the command gives the breakdown for all members of the group. This is a handy command that helps to identify the users within a group who have more files and/or a large amount of data and ask them to better manage their data by reducing their file count usage for example.

<!--T:21-->
In the following example, user <b>user01</b> runs the command and gets the following output:

<!--T:22-->
<source lang="bash">
[user01@cedar1 ~]$ diskusage_report --per_user --all_users
                             Description                Space           # of files
                     /home (user user01)             109k/50G              12/500k
                  /scratch (user user01)             4000/20T              1/1000k
                 /project (group user01)              0/2048k               0/1025
          /project (group def-professor)            9434G/10T            497k/500k
