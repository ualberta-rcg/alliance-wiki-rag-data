<!--T:1-->
An annual account renewal process takes place typically in the spring, as this is a critical process ensuring that:

<!--T:2-->
# Accounts that are no longer needed are deactivated; and
# Information that funding agencies and partners require is collected for reporting purposes.

<!--T:3-->
The information we collect about researchers and their results is important for reports to funding agencies and the digital research infrastructure (DRI) ecosystem.

<!--T:4-->
If you have an active account, we will send you an email during the account renewal period directing you to our account renewal form.

<!--T:5-->
'''Deactivation of Accounts'''

<!--T:6-->
If users let their CCDB account expire, they will be no longer able to login into any of our systems.

<!--T:7-->
If a Principal Investigator (PI) allows their account to expire, their account as well as the account of all those users that they sponsor will also be deactivated.

<!--T:8-->
Accounts can be reactivated at any time by logging into [https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/ CCDB] and completing the account renewal form.

<!--T:9-->
Users that do not want to renew their CCDB account but still want to recover their files can request a temporary extension by sending an email to support@tech.alliancecan.ca.

<!--T:10-->
You can find more information about account renewals on our [[Account renewal FAQ|Account Renewals FAQ page]] or by contacting renewals@tech.alliancecan.ca.
