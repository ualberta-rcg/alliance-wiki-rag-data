    "url": "https://libcal.mcmaster.ca/event/3919883",
    "description": "From datasets and code to podcasts, reports, and performances, not all research outputs take the form of journal articles or books. These are known as Non-Traditional Research Outputs (NTROs)—scholarly or creative works that fall outside conventional academic publishing. While NTROs make up a significant and growing part of research activity, they are often under-recognized in systems that track and assess research impact. In this webinar, participants will explore current best practices for tracking and expressing the impact of NTROs and learn how these practices align with movements, like the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), advocating for more responsible research assessment.\n\nParticipants will learn how to:\n\n- Create persistent identifiers (e.g. DOIs) and metadata records for NTROs.\n- Incorporate NTROs into existing researcher profile systems (e.g. ORCiD; McMaster Experts).\n- Communicate the value of NTROs to responsible research assessment practices.\n\nThis session is ideal for researchers, creators, and academic staff working with non-traditional outputs who want to make their work more visible, trackable, and valued.\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/dr25-26/ntros.html). This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared on the same page, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre's [Online Learning Catalogue.](https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/)\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** Jack Young (he/him) is McMaster’s Research Impact Librarian, supporting the use of bibliometric data to enhance the reporting and strategic planning practices of the University’s academic departments, institutes, and researchers.\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program. For more information, visit [scds.ca/certificate-program](http://scds.ca/certificate-program). It is also eligible for the Canadian Certificate for Digital Humanities. To learn more, visit [ccdhhn.ca](http://ccdhhn.ca) or contact [scds@mcmaster.ca](mailto:scds@mcmaster.ca).\n\n**Credit Eligibility: **This workshop counts toward credit for students in the Faculty of Science who are enrolled in SCIENCE 2SF1: Digital Skills Workshop.

This workshop focuses on the mechanics of submitting programs (aka “jobs”) to the clusters for scheduling and execution. Led by Kamil Marcinkowski, scheduling team lead for the Digital Research Alliance of Canada, this workshop will contain extra emphasis on interacting with the scheduler to ensure that your work is getting done rather than sitting in the queue. This workshop provides that background in a friendly, jargon-minimized, hands-on environment. HPC Shell and Scripting are prerequisites, or a solid understanding of the Unix environment.\n\nTo find other courses in this series, please visit:\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/research-computing/bootcamps.html",
