However, its performance often lags behind traditional compiled languages like C, C++, and Fortran, as well as newer contenders like Julia and Chapel. This course is designed to help you speed up your Python workflows using a variety of tools and techniques.  \nWe’ll begin with classic optimization methods such as NumPy-based vectorization, and explore just-in-time compilation using Numba, along with performance profiling techniques. From there, we’ll delve into parallelization – starting with multithreading using external libraries like NumExpr and Python 3.13’s new free-threading capabilities – but placing greater emphasis on multiprocessing.  \nNext, we’ll dive into Ray, a powerful and flexible framework for scaling Python applications. While Ray is widely used in AI, our focus will be on its core capabilities for distributed computing and data processing. You’ll learn how to parallelize CPU-bound numerical workflows – with and without reduction – as well as optimize I/O-bound tasks. We’ll also explore combining Ray with Numba and will discuss coding tightly coupled parallel problems.",

    "description": "This set of five workshops is an introduction to Python programming, with a focus on skills that are relevant to students and researchers who are working with data, particularly tabular data.\n\nThe five workshops cover the following:\n\n- Part 1: To understand the basics of Python syntax, variables, and data types.\n- Part 2: To learn how to work with tabular data in Python, including reading, manipulating, and visualizing data.\n- Part 3: To learn how to automate tasks in Python, including working with multiple files.\n- Part 4: To learn to use logic and modularity to make Python code flexible and reusable.\n- Part 5: To develop good habits for programming for research in Python, including handling errors, debugging, and writing reliable code.\n\nParticipants must sign up for each workshop individually. It is not necessary to sign up for the first workshop in order to do the second (and so on), but note that each workshop will build on the topics covered in previous workshops in this series.\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\nThere are no prerequisites needed for this series; no prior programming experience is required.\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n\nIn these workshops, we will write Python code in a text editor called Visual Studio Code (VS Code).\n\nPlease follow the following steps/links to complete the setup for this workshop series before you attend:\n\n1. Install a [Python Interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter)\n2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n3. Install the [Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). If you want more info on installing extensions for VS Code, [see this page on their “Extension Marketplace”](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace)\n4. Install this [Python Debugger extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy)\n\n**NOTE:** You may use your own preferred text editor or Jupyter Notebooks to write code in these workshops, but keep in mind that some aspects may be unpredictably different from the way things appear on the instructor's screen. For example, the instructor will frequently use the Python Debugger in VS Code, and other text editors may have entirely different mechanisms for debugging, and you may have to figure that out on your own. If you want to follow what the instructor is doing exactly, you should install VS Code and the extensions listed above.\n\n### Location details:\n\n\tLocation:\n\t*IN-PERSON and ONLINE* (synchronous)\n\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, or accessibility needs, please email **[digital.scholarship@ubc.ca](mailto:digital.scholarship@ubc.ca).**\n\nTo keep up-to-date with all our workshops, consults, and events, [subscribe to the UBC Library Research Commons monthly newsletter](https://bit.ly/UBCRCNewsSubscribeEnvoke).\n\nThis event is in-person and online (synchronous).

A significant attention will be given to making the code efficient. The course has a programming assignment at the end. Submitted assignments will be graded by the instructors. If your assignment fared well, you will get a certificate for the course completion.\n\nThis course is self-paced, but will also have live online classes on **Tues. Dec. 9, Fri. Dec. 12, Tues. Dec. 16,** and **Fri. Dec. 19** from **1 P.M. to 2 P.M.** Eastern Time. Recordings of live classes will be available afterwards in this course for self-paced learning and review.\n\n  \n  \nAccess is restricted to Digital Research Alliance of Canada (formerly Compute Canada) authenticated users only.",

While its web dashboard offers a user-friendly interface and can be convenient at times, it often involves too many clicks to complete routine tasks such as creating and configuring a virtual machine. The command-line interface (CLI) offers a faster, more streamlined way to create and manage resources. In this webinar, we will discuss `python-openstackclient`, walk through its setup and authentication, and demonstrate how to efficiently perform common OpenStack operations from the terminal. Whether you are managing a few instances or automating workflows, this session will help you leverage the CLI for speed, simplicity, and productivity.",

This lack of interpretability raises challenges in trust, accountability, and model debugging. In this talk, we explore Integrated Gradients, a principled method for attributing a model’s prediction to its input features. By integrating gradients of the model’s output with respect to its inputs along a path from a baseline to the actual input, this technique provides a mathematically grounded way to identify which features most influence the outcome. We will discuss the theoretical foundations of integrated gradients, their advantages over simpler attribution methods, and practical examples that illustrate how they reveal meaningful insights about model behavior.\n\n---\n\n  \n_The Compute Ontario Colloquia are weekly Zoom presentations on Advanced Research Computing, High Performance Computing, Research Data Management, and Research Software topics, delivered by staff from three Compute Ontario consortia (CAC, SciNet, SHARCNET) and guest speakers. The series began January 2023 and superseded similar series previously delivered by individual consortia (e.g. General Interest Seminars by SHARCNET or User Group Meeting TechTalks by SciNet). The colloquia are one hour long and include time for questions. No registration is required.
