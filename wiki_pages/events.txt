Containerization is a hot topic in cloud computing. The target of this talk is to present a broad overview of containerization and related technologies. It's intended to lead into future sessions that will go deeper into each specific containerization subject. \nWe will start by answering the question \"what is a container?\", followed by the benefits of using containers, and comparison between containers and virtual machines. Docker, as the most popular containerization tool will be introduced subsquently, with a discussion of concepts and basic operations, and how to interact with image repositories. Two other tools for implementing containerization in specific scenarios (Singularity and Kubernetes) will also be briefly introduced. Time permitting, we will demonstrate examples of using Singularity and Kubernetes.\n\nTo find other courses in this series, please visit:\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/research-computing/bootcamps.html",

While the primary emphasis is on computational workflows, key wet-lab concepts relevant to data quality and preprocessing will also be covered.  \n  \nSession 1: Understanding scRNA-seq and Data Preprocessing  \n- Overview of scRNA-seq experimental workflow: sample preparation, sequencing technologies, and critical wet-lab QC steps.  \n- Introduction to bioinformatics tools for preprocessing: handling raw sequencing data, demultiplexing, and quality control.  \n- Hands-on session using tools like Cell Ranger, FastQC, and MultiQC to assess sequencing quality and detect common issues.  \n  \nSession 2: Data Processing, Analysis, and Visualization  \n- Processing single-cell data with Seurat (R) or Scanpy (Python): normalization, filtering, and feature selection.  \n- Dimensionality reduction, clustering, and cell type annotation.  \n- Differential expression analysis and integration of multiple datasets.  \n- Best practices for visualizing results and reporting findings.  \n  \nWho Should Attend?  \nThis workshop is ideal for researchers, bioinformaticians, and students who want a hands-on introduction to scRNA-seq data processing and analysis, with insights into wet-lab considerations for data quality. No prior experience in scRNA-seq analysis is required, but basic knowledge of Linux command line, HPC, R or Python is beneficial.  \n  \nTo find other courses in this series, please visit:  \n[https://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/research-computing/bootcamps.html](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/research-computing/bootcamps.html)",

    "description": "A thought-provoking exploration of the implications of data scraping in a world changed by AI. What is \"public data\" anyway? This session delves into the concept of \"Public Data\" as seen under both the academic research and general lens. We'll discuss the impacts of accessing and collecting data as well as the knock-on effects of using machine learning models trained with it. Factors such as privacy, cybersecurity, copyright, legislation, acceptable use, and applicable organizational policy all factor into this complex topic. In a time when many are looking for simple answers, the situation is anything but simple. While some desire to collect data, others are seeking ways to prevent their data from being scraped in the first place, or at least get their lawyers involved after the fact.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is facilitated by Scott Baker. Scott manages the Research Cybersecurity and Compliance team at UBC Advanced Research Computing: a group focused on supporting researchers to find secure solutions for their project architectures and research data as well as navigating compliance requirements. He is a member of the program leadership committee for UBC's Privacy &amp; Information Security Management program. He is also a member of the Digital Research Alliance of Canada national security council where he chairs the governance and policy working group.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_ROvjJmryTveg-84Hik76Ww)",

While the web interface is intuitive and remains our primary recommendation for most users, the command-line interface (CLI) offers advanced capabilities for automation, scripting, and managing large-scale workflows. In this webinar, we will present the globus-cli tool, show how to authenticate and configure your environment, and demonstrate key commands for transferring, monitoring, and managing files between endpoints. You will also learn tips for integrating globus-cli into scripts for repeatable and efficient data movement.",

It is high level enough that learning it is easy, and coding with it is significantly faster than other programming languages. However, the performance of pure Python programs is often sub-optimal, and might hinder your research. In this course, we will show you some ways to identify performance bottlenecks, improve slow blocks of code, and extend Python with compiled code. You'll learn about various ways to optimise and parallelise Python programs, particularly in the context of scientific and [high performance computing](https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=96&amp;displayformat=dictionary).\n\n  \n  \n\n**Prerequisite knowledge:** Know what classes and functions are; familiarity with Jupyter Notebook; basic console use; and comfortable with Python software carpentry material.\n\nLive online classes will take place on **Tues. Oct. 14, Fri. Oct. 17, Tues. Oct. 21,** and **Fri. Oct. 24** from **1 P.M. to 2 P.M.** Eastern Time.
