    "description": "The Winter Visualization Series is a multi-week lineup of hands-on workshops designed to introduce participants to modern scientific and data-driven visualization tools and techniques. Spanning both foundational skills and advanced workflows, the series highlights a broad ecosystem of tools used across research, education, and industry.\r\n\r\nParticipants will explore core Python plotting libraries -- including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Vega-Altair -- as well as the principles behind the grammar of graphics in both R and Python. Several sessions focus on ParaView, covering essential usage, scripting, animation, remote visualization strategies for large-scale data, and in-situ workflows using Catalyst2. Additional workshops introduce visualization in domain-specific tools such as VMD for molecular graphics and Gephi for network visualization, and modern web-based frameworks like vtk.js and trame.\r\n\r\nYou are encouraged to bring your own datasets to these workshops.\r\n\r\n➡️ Register [here](https://forms.gle/XyjAMRDAM4A3DCr7A) (registration is required to receive the Zoom link)\r\n🗓️ To add individual workshops to your calendar, visit [this page](http://folio.vastcloud.org/winterseries)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nL’école hivernale de visualisation vous propose de nombreux ateliers pratiques conçus pour vous initier aux outils et aux techniques modernes de visualisation scientifique et de données. Couvrant à la fois les bases de la visualisation et les flux de travail plus avancés, cette école met en lumière un vaste écosystème d'outils utilisés dans la recherche, l'éducation et l'industrie.\r\n\r\nLes premiers ateliers exploreront les principales bibliothèques de visualisation en Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly et Vega-Altair) ainsi que les principes fondamentaux de la représentation graphique en R et en Python. Ensuite, plusieurs ateliers seront consacrés à ParaView : utilisation de base, programmation, animation, stratégies de visualisation à distance pour les données à grande échelle et flux de travail in situ avec Catalyst2. Enfin, d'autres ateliers présenteront la visualisation dans des outils spécialisés tels que VMD pour la visualisation moléculaire et Gephi pour la visualisation de réseaux, ainsi que des frameworks web modernes comme vtk.js et trame.\r\n\r\nNous vous encourageons à apporter vos propres données à ces ateliers.\r\n\r\n➡️ Inscrivez-vous [ici](https://forms.gle/XyjAMRDAM4A3DCr7A) (l’inscription est requise pour obtenir un lien Zoom)\r\n🗓️ Pour ajouter individuellement des ateliers à votre calendrier, visitez [cette page](https://folio.vastcloud.org/ecolehivernale)\r\n\r\n• [Jan-20, 10am PT] [Intro session: which tool is right for me? ](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/intro-session-which-tool-is-right-for-me-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Jan-20, 11am PT] [Plotting in Python with Matplotlib](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/plotting-in-python-with-matplotlib-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Jan-27, 10am PT] [Plotting in Python with Seaborn](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/plotting-in-python-with-seaborn-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Jan-30, 10am PT] [Plotting in Python with Plotly](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/plotting-in-python-with-plotly-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-03, 10am PT] [Plotting in Python with Vega-Altair](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/plotting-in-python-with-vega-altair-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-06, 10am PT] [Basic ParaView](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/basic-paraview-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-10, 10am PT] [The grammar of graphics in R and Python](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/the-grammar-of-graphics-in-r-and-python-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-13, 10am PT] [ Introduction à ParaView - en français](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/basic-paraview-in-french-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-24, 10am PT] [ParaView scripting](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/paraview-scripting-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-27, 10am PT] [ Scripter des visualisations via ParaView - en français](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/paraview-scripting-in-french-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-03, 10am PT] [ParaView animation](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/paraview-animation-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-06, 10am PT] [ Visualisations animées avec ParaView - en français](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/paraview-animation-in-french-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-10, 10am PT] [Remote and large-scale visualization in ParaView](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/remote-and-large-scale-visualization-in-paraview-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-13, 10am PT] [Introductory VMD](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/introductory-vmd-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-17, 10am PT] [Programmable Filter and Source in ParaView](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/programmable-filter-and-source-in-paraview-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-20, 10am PT] [Network visualization with Gephi](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/network-visualization-with-gephi-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-24, 10am PT] [In-situ visualization with Catalyst2](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/in-situ-visualization-with-catalyst2-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-27, 10am PT] [Modern tools for web visualization](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/modern-tools-for-web-visualization-winter-vis-series)",

    "description": "Learn the basics of using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. Git is widely used version control software that tracks changes to a group of files, referred to as a repository. GitHub is a popular website for hosting and sharing Git repositories, making it easier to collaborate and share your work. Together, Git and GitHub provide a platform that is increasingly used for collaboration in research and academic environments. In this beginner workshop participants will learn key concepts, create their own Git repository, and publish to GitHub. No previous experience with Git is required.
