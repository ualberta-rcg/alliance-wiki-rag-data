    "description": "Privacy and Security functions often operate in silos, each with its own objectives, language, and blind spots. This fragmented approach leads to inefficiencies, duplicated efforts, and missed opportunities for strategic alignment. \r\n\r\nIn this keynote, Sharon Bauer introduces GPS: Governance, Privacy, and Security in harmony. Drawing on Bamboo’s integrative framework, Sharon will demonstrate how aligning privacy and security unlocks hidden synergies, accelerates compliance, and builds trust with stakeholders. Through real-world examples, she will show how GPS helps organizations overcome internal roadblocks, re-route quickly in response to risk, and scale with confidence. \r\n\r\nThis session will challenge tunnel vision thinking and offer a new path forward, one that replaces conflict with collaboration and transforms privacy and security into a unified force for governance excellence.\r\n\r\nSharon Bauer is the Founder of Bamboo Data Consulting and a nationally recognized Privacy Strategist. Named one of the top 20 women in cybersecurity in Canada, Sharon brings a rare blend of legal expertise, strategic insight, and operational experience to her work. A former litigator with over a decade of courtroom experience, she now leads privacy programs for organizations across sectors, acting as a virtual privacy officer and trusted advisor. \r\n\r\nSharon is known for her ability to uncover hidden privacy challenges and design creative, scalable solutions that align with business goals. She has helped shape privacy-by-design strategies for widely used consumer products and is a frequent speaker and writer on emerging privacy trends. Her work sits at the intersection of governance, privacy, and security, empowering organizations to build trust, reduce risk, and stay ahead of regulatory change.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5l_pk1D5T1iRm8GXz0lX9w)",

Containerization is a hot topic in cloud computing. The target of this talk is to present a broad overview of containerization and related technologies. It's intended to lead into future sessions that will go deeper into each specific containerization subject. \nWe will start by answering the question \"what is a container?\", followed by the benefits of using containers, and comparison between containers and virtual machines. Docker, as the most popular containerization tool will be introduced subsquently, with a discussion of concepts and basic operations, and how to interact with image repositories. Two other tools for implementing containerization in specific scenarios (Singularity and Kubernetes) will also be briefly introduced. Time permitting, we will demonstrate examples of using Singularity and Kubernetes.\n\nTo find other courses in this series, please visit:\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/research-computing/bootcamps.html",
