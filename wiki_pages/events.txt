    "name": "Introduction to Python: Part 5",
    "url": "https://libcal.library.ubc.ca/event/3965207",
    "description": "This set of five workshops is an introduction to Python programming, with a focus on skills that are relevant to students and researchers who are working with data, particularly tabular data.\n\nThe five workshops cover the following:\n\n- Part 1: To understand the basics of Python syntax, variables, and data types.\n- Part 2: To learn how to work with tabular data in Python, including reading, manipulating, and visualizing data.\n- Part 3: To learn how to automate tasks in Python, including working with multiple files.\n- Part 4: To learn to use logic and modularity to make Python code flexible and reusable.\n- Part 5: To develop good habits for programming for research in Python, including handling errors, debugging, and writing reliable code.\n\nParticipants must sign up for each workshop individually. It is not necessary to sign up for the first workshop in order to do the second (and so on), but note that each workshop will build on the topics covered in previous workshops in this series.\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\nThere are no prerequisites needed for this series; no prior programming experience is required.\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n\nIn these workshops, we will write Python code in a text editor called Visual Studio Code (VS Code).\n\nPlease follow the following steps/links to complete the setup for this workshop series before you attend:\n\n1. Install a [Python Interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter)\n2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n3. Install the [Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). If you want more info on installing extensions for VS Code, [see this page on their “Extension Marketplace”](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace)\n4. Install this [Python Debugger extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy)\n\n**NOTE:** You may use your own preferred text editor or Jupyter Notebooks to write code in these workshops, but keep in mind that some aspects may be unpredictably different from the way things appear on the instructor's screen. For example, the instructor will frequently use the Python Debugger in VS Code, and other text editors may have entirely different mechanisms for debugging, and you may have to figure that out on your own. If you want to follow what the instructor is doing exactly, you should install VS Code and the extensions listed above.\n\n### Location details:\n\n\tLocation:\n\t*IN-PERSON and ONLINE* (synchronous)\n\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, or accessibility needs, please email **[digital.scholarship@ubc.ca](mailto:digital.scholarship@ubc.ca).**\n\nTo keep up-to-date with all our workshops, consults, and events, [subscribe to the UBC Library Research Commons monthly newsletter](https://bit.ly/UBCRCNewsSubscribeEnvoke).\n\nThis event is in-person and online (synchronous). Registrants receive the online link 3 hours before the event. Registration closes at that time.",

This lack of interpretability raises challenges in trust, accountability, and model debugging. In this talk, we explore Integrated Gradients, a principled method for attributing a model’s prediction to its input features. By integrating gradients of the model’s output with respect to its inputs along a path from a baseline to the actual input, this technique provides a mathematically grounded way to identify which features most influence the outcome. We will discuss the theoretical foundations of integrated gradients, their advantages over simpler attribution methods, and practical examples that illustrate how they reveal meaningful insights about model behavior.\n\n---\n\n  \n_The Compute Ontario Colloquia are weekly Zoom presentations on Advanced Research Computing, High Performance Computing, Research Data Management, and Research Software topics, delivered by staff from three Compute Ontario consortia (CAC, SciNet, SHARCNET) and guest speakers. The series began January 2023 and superseded similar series previously delivered by individual consortia (e.g. General Interest Seminars by SHARCNET or User Group Meeting TechTalks by SciNet). The colloquia are one hour long and include time for questions. No registration is required. Presentations are usually recorded and uploaded to the hosting consortium video channel (colloquia hosted by SHARCNET go to [our youtube channel](http://youtube.sharcnet.ca))._",

This tutorial is full of short exercises and code examples. It is directed to undergraduate or graduate students interested in learning R to apply it in assignments, projects, or theses but with no programming experience.\n\nPart 1 (Aug 25 @ 4) covers using operators, expressions, variables, and built-in functions in R. Understanding assignment and how arguments work when calling functions. The data types and structures R offers to model data. Introduction to vectors. Part 2 (Aug 26 @ 4) covers the remaining data structures to model and manipulate data: factors, matrices, arrays, lists, and finally, the workhorse of data analysis, the data frame. We will study the basics of subsetting and ordering for data structures. Finally, we will have a look at user functions and basic control flow.",
