    "description": "In an era where data privacy is constantly under threat due to its value, it's important to understand what settings are available to you to best protect it. This presentation will provide you with practical, no-nonsense guidance on how to adjust privacy settings across various Microsoft products to ensure your research data remains confidential. You will be provided with a framework for assessing the privacy of software as a service provider and what you should be reviewing to help you identify potential risks and common pitfalls to avoid.\r\nWe'll dive into the often-overlooked privacy controls available in Windows, Microsoft 365, and other Azure-related services. You'll learn how to navigate these settings to protect and limit exposure to your information. We'll also discuss the implications of enabling connected experiences in Microsoft 365 and the privacy risks associated with features like Windows Recall and other recent additions.\r\nThis session is designed for researchers but will offer valuable information for anyone working with sensitive information who wants to ensure their data remains secure when using some of the most popular professional software available. By the end of this session, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the practical steps you can take to keep your research data private and protect yourself from accidental disclosure.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is offered by Taylor Bohn. Taylor is an Information Security Risk Advisor at UBC, supporting the university’s compliance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). Taylor conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) to help University initiatives of all sizes identify and mitigate privacy and information security risks. With a Bachelor of Commerce in Operations Management from the University of Saskatchewan and a self-taught foundation in IT gathering various certifications along the way, Taylor brings a practical, adaptive approach to risk management. His experience in IT spans Vancouver-based startups in both the finance and healthcare industries, with strengths in systems administration, business process improvement and automation. Besides reading privacy policies in his spare time Taylor is passionate about doing work that drives meaningful change and makes a positive impact on others.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Xxy7CJl8RBu0eOgzPD776Q)",

Not surprisingly, they are increasingly becoming integrated into many software, including text editors.  \nEmacs is no exception, and a number of packages have recently been developed to access models smoothly and directly. Of particular notice:\n- copilot.el brings GitHub Copilot's code completion to Emacs,\n- copilot-chat.el allows to chat, perform code review, code correction, code optimization, code transformation, and code explanation with GitHub Copilot in Emacs,\n- gptel allows access to any LLM from any buffer,\n- chatgpt-shell provides an Emacs shell to chat with any LLM.\nIn this webinar, I will demo these packages and show you how to install them and set things up.",

    "description": "Whether you regularly engage with visual generative AI or are just dipping your toe into these waters, this workshop focuses on recognizing sources of image biases and its impacts and implications as artificial images become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous. Applying a combined historical and ethics lens, workshop participants will have the opportunity to generate and analyze artificial images as a means of unpacking continuity and changes in visual practices and norms. The workshop supports the development of critical reflection skills and tools for creating and ‘reading’ images that avoid potential pitfalls of (re)producing harmful clichés and to support identification of mis/disinformation. The workshop has relevance for academic integrity along with navigating our daily visual landscape, which in turn has implications for democracy, civic engagement, and human relationships. At a time when visual evidence/truth, dis/misinformation and academic integrity are at stake, there is no time like the present to gain a solid foundation on visual literacy.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:\n\n- Identify opportunities, pitfalls and potential harms of visual generative AI to make informed decisions on its use in educational and every-day life settings by exploring recent examples.\n- Unpack the role of audience engagement with visual images in the era of AI to critically analyse the impacts of and to support responsible use of this new technology.\n- Trace biases and ethically problematic visual stereotypes present in AI-generated images through comparison and critical reflection of historical cases\n\nThis workshop is great for students, educators, researchers, and professionals interested in developing critical visual literacy skills to responsibly engage with AI-generated images in academic, creative, or everyday contexts!\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/dmds25-26/ai-visions.html). This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared on the same page, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre's [Online Learning Catalogue.](https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/)\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** \n\nDr. Sonya de Laat is the Academic Program Advisor and Curriculum Coordinator in the School of Global Health and Social Medicine, and a Research Associate with the Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact at McMaster University. With degrees in Anthropology and Media Studies, Dr. de Laat’s work has focused on historical and ethical dimensions of humanitarian visual culture and action. Currently, her focus is on challenging the promises/hopes of photorealistic generative AI and sharing diverse visual histories as a corrective intervention. Her postdoctoral work focused on moral and practical dimensions of palliative care in refugee camps drawing attention to small interventions having big impacts, and the importance of co-design and partnered research. Dr. de Laat is an active member of the Humanitarian Health Ethics research group, and the Canadian Network on Humanitarian History. Representative publications include, “Assembling a global health image: Ethical and pragmatic tensions through the lenses of photographers” (PLOS Glob Public Health 2024), “A case analysis of partnered research on palliative care for refugees in Jordan and Rwanda” (Confl Health 2021), and “The Camera and the Red Cross: ‘Lamentable pictures’ and Conflict Photography Bring into Focus an International Movement, 1855-1865” (IRRC 2021).\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program.
