All previous versions of files are saved and you can even revert to a previous version. Git is a version control software. Git-portal sites, like GitHub or GitLab, offer many useful features to facilitate collaborative development.\n\nThis is the second workshop of a two-part series. The first session focuses on version control. The second explores using Git for collaborative development.\n\nThis session will focus on collaborative development workflows using Git-collaboration sites like GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. It will demonstrate how to work with branches, issue tracking, contribute to projects using pull-/merge-requests, code-review, how to run CI/CD-pipelines, and how to use other common features of these platforms.",

However, its performance often lags behind traditional compiled languages like C, C++, and Fortran, as well as newer contenders like Julia and Chapel. This course is designed to help you speed up your Python workflows using a variety of tools and techniques.  \nWe’ll begin with classic optimization methods such as NumPy-based vectorization, and explore just-in-time compilation using Numba, along with performance profiling techniques. From there, we’ll delve into parallelization – starting with multithreading using external libraries like NumExpr and Python 3.13’s new free-threading capabilities – but placing greater emphasis on multiprocessing.  \nNext, we’ll dive into Ray, a powerful and flexible framework for scaling Python applications. While Ray is widely used in AI, our focus will be on its core capabilities for distributed computing and data processing. You’ll learn how to parallelize CPU-bound numerical workflows – with and without reduction – as well as optimize I/O-bound tasks. We’ll also explore combining Ray with Numba and will discuss coding tightly coupled parallel problems.",

This webinar examines practical strategies for consolidating large numbers of short tasks, including job arrays, task bundling techniques, and wrapper-based aggregation. We will discuss how these approaches differ in overhead, portability, scheduler behavior, and job failure handling. The session will also provide guidance on recognizing when packaging options no longer yield sufficient throughput and when transitioning to a serial farming model becomes advantageous. Serial farms can mitigate scheduler pressure, improve wait times on busy clusters, and offer more predictable performance. Examples will be provided throughout the Webinar and shared on GitHub for future reference.   \n---  \n  \nZoom account is required.

    "description": "This set of five workshops is an introduction to Python programming, with a focus on skills that are relevant to students and researchers who are working with data, particularly tabular data.\n\nThe five workshops cover the following:\n\n- Part 1: To understand the basics of Python syntax, variables, and data types.\n- Part 2: To learn how to work with tabular data in Python, including reading, manipulating, and visualizing data.\n- Part 3: To learn how to automate tasks in Python, including working with multiple files.\n- Part 4: To learn to use logic and modularity to make Python code flexible and reusable.\n- Part 5: To develop good habits for programming for research in Python, including handling errors, debugging, and writing reliable code.\n\nParticipants must sign up for each workshop individually. It is not necessary to sign up for the first workshop in order to do the second (and so on), but note that each workshop will build on the topics covered in previous workshops in this series.\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\nThere are no prerequisites needed for this series; no prior programming experience is required.\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n\nIn these workshops, we will write Python code in a text editor called Visual Studio Code (VS Code).\n\nPlease follow the following steps/links to complete the setup for this workshop series before you attend:\n\n1. Install a [Python Interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter)\n2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n3. Install the [Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). If you want more info on installing extensions for VS Code, [see this page on their “Extension Marketplace”](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace)\n4. Install this [Python Debugger extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy)\n\n**NOTE:** You may use your own preferred text editor or Jupyter Notebooks to write code in these workshops, but keep in mind that some aspects may be unpredictably different from the way things appear on the instructor's screen. For example, the instructor will frequently use the Python Debugger in VS Code, and other text editors may have entirely different mechanisms for debugging, and you may have to figure that out on your own. If you want to follow what the instructor is doing exactly, you should install VS Code and the extensions listed above.\n\n### Location details:\n\n\tLocation:\n\t*IN-PERSON and ONLINE* (synchronous)\n\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, or accessibility needs, please email **[digital.scholarship@ubc.ca](mailto:digital.scholarship@ubc.ca).**\n\nTo keep up-to-date with all our workshops, consults, and events, [subscribe to the UBC Library Research Commons monthly newsletter](https://bit.ly/UBCRCNewsSubscribeEnvoke).\n\nThis event is in-person and online (synchronous). Registrants receive the online link 3 hours before the event. Registration closes at that time.",
