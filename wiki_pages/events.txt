    "description": "We’ve all been there: a reviewer or supervisor asks for your analysis, and you realize you have no idea how you got those results. This workshop is a judgment-free zone for anyone who’s lost track of their own work, it happens! \n\nWe’ll explore why research reproducibility and replicability matter, what happens if it’s not, and how to detect unreliable research around you. This workshop will also explore tools and techniques to make your research reproducible—even if you’re starting from a pile of mystery scripts. Learn how to document, automate and share your workflows so future-you (and others) won’t be left in the dark.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:  \n•    Understand the principles and importance of reproducible and replicable research  \n•    Learn strategies for creating, maintaining and sharing reproducible research  \n•    Learn how to start identifying unreliable data around them\n\nReproducibility: because your future self deserves better than \"I swear it worked once!\"\n\nThis is an online event, please register to receive the event link. This workshop will be recorded, and the recording and workshop materials will be available online and sent to all registrants after the workshop. If you have accommodation requests or questions, reach out to [libevents@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:libevents@uwaterloo.ca) with your needs.   \n\nPlease note: This is the third of a four-part workshop series related to data and research data management.

    "description": "As research continues to generate and depend on vast volumes of data, the boundaries between healthcare, computation, and innovation continue to blur. High-performance computing, cloud environments, and federated data platforms are transforming how research is conducted, yet the frameworks that govern cybersecurity, privacy, and data management often struggle to keep pace with this digital acceleration.\r\n \r\nIn this session, Irfaan, Senior Information Risk Analyst at the SickKids Research Institute, introduces how cybersecurity and information risk management principles can strengthen trust, integrity, and collaboration across the research lifecycle. Drawing on experience at the intersection of clinical research, IT compliance, and information risk, he will outline how standards such as those from NIST and policy instruments like Canada’s Tri- Agency Research Data Management Policy influence how institutions think about protecting data, enabling collaboration, and supporting responsible research.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn that effective security in research is not only about firewalls and encryption, but also about building a culture of responsible innovation that safeguards data, protects patients, and sustains discovery across Ontario’s research ecosystem.",

    "description": "This presentation is based on a recently published paper - see https://ojs.library.carleton.ca/index.php/PPJ-CIPSER/article/view/4990.  The paper explores the application of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles to High Performance Computing Infrastructure (HPCI), which has become increasingly crucial for scientific, industrial, and AI workloads. Traditional cybersecurity frameworks like the ISO 27000-series and NIST 800-series have proven inadequate for the unique challenges posed by HPCI. \r\n\r\nThe paper is informed by three regulatory frameworks: OMB Memo M-22-09, CISA's Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM), and NIST Special Publication 800-223, which collectively shape the U.S. Federal Government's approach to ZTA in HPCI. The study assesses the compatibility of ZTMM with HPCI across five pillars, identifying potential challenges in balancing security, cost, complexity, and performance. The findings suggest that a \"Traditional\" maturity level is most suitable for HPCI, given its unique characteristics and operational demands.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is facilitated by Tyson Macaulay and Daksha Bhasker. Tyson is an active security researcher and lecturer at Carleton University specializing in Critical Infrastructure Protection. Tyson has a personal syllabus of four books, dozens of periodical publications, international standards contributions, several registered patents and continues to support the development of engineering and security standards through volunteer efforts in the International Standards Organization (ISO) and Professional Engineers of Ontario (PEO), and various Board positions. Tyson has worked extensively in the cyber security industry with networking, Data Centers, High Performance Computing (HPC) and blockchain technology. \r\n\r\nDaksha Bhasker (P.Eng, CISSP) is a Principal Security Architect at Navy Federal Credit Union. She has over 20 years of experience in the software and telecommunications service provider industry with multinationals as Microsoft, Comcast NBCUniversal and Bell Canada, working on complex carrier grade system security architectures. She is passionate about security of emerging technologies, engaging with the broader security industry to better the state of technical security architectures.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_jjbpdmwZT-atAw6aJHdxfQ)",
