    "description": "Creative AI tools increasingly allow for the partial or complete automation of creative tasks. Be it through the augmentation of existing creative software or through embedded real-time generation, these algorithms have a growing influence on creative practices. Creative AI will not take over the world, but it certainly increasingly impacts creators, students, educators, and the industry at large.\r\n\r\nNow that generative algorithms have human-competitive skills for many creative tasks and are being deployed for professional and amateur alike, it is critical to evaluate and discuss the implications of such developments. We introduce challenges and opportunities arising through a series of examples of generative systems developed at the Metacreation Lab and experiments conducted with these systems. We will introduce a range of tools readily available for computer-assisted sound design, music composition, and visual generation, demonstrate them, and discuss their common implications on creative processes and workflow. We will present results of evaluations conducted with the music software industry focusing on user experience, ethics, sense of authorship, and technological acceptance.\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker:\r\nPhilippe Pasquier is a scientific researcher, artist, educator, and a community builder. He is the director of the Metacreation Lab for Creative AI, and a Professor at Simon Fraser University's School for Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT), in Vancouver (Canada). There, he is pursuing a multidisciplinary research-creation program focused on generative systems and applied AI for creative tasks, computer-assisted creativity, and co-creative systems.\r\n\r\nAlong with the Metacreation Lab fellows, Philippe has co-authored over 250 peer-reviewed contributions presented in the most rigorous scientific venues, and has been honored with 9 best paper awards. His MOOC class on Generative Art and Computational Creativity on the Kadenze platform serves thousands. The Metacreation Lab artistic work has been shown in prominent venues on six continents, including at Ars Electronica, IRCAM, ZKM, Centre Pompidou, Eastern Block, Earzoom festival, several ISEA editions, Mutek Festival, Sydney Biennale, etc. The Lab's projects are also finding industrial applications, and its music AI algorithms have reached millions through open-source release of tools, code, datasets, and collaborations with the software industry (e.g., Steinberg, Teenage Engineering, Elias, Microsoft, Huawei, …).\r\n\r\n//\r\n\r\nLes outils d’IA créative permettent de plus en plus l’automatisation partielle ou complète de tâches créatives. Qu’il s’agisse d’augmenter des logiciels créatifs existants ou d’intégrer une génération en temps réel, ces algorithmes exercent une influence croissante sur les pratiques créatives. L’IA créative ne prendra pas le contrôle du monde, mais elle a bel et bien un impact grandissant sur les créateurs et créatrices, les étudiantes et étudiants, le corps enseignant et l’industrie dans son ensemble.\r\n\r\nÀ présent que les algorithmes génératifs disposent de compétences comparables à celles des humains pour de nombreuses tâches créatives, et qu’ils sont déployés aussi bien dans des contextes professionnels qu’amateurs, il est essentiel d’évaluer et de discuter les implications de ces évolutions. Nous présentons les défis et les opportunités qui en découlent à travers une série d’exemples de systèmes génératifs développés au Metacreation Lab, ainsi que des expériences menées avec ces systèmes.\r\n\r\nNous présenterons une série d’outils facilement accessibles pour la conception sonore assistée par ordinateur, la composition musicale et la génération visuelle, nous en ferons la démonstration et nous discuterons de leurs implications communes sur les processus créatifs et les flux de travail. Nous présenterons les résultats d’évaluations menées avec l’industrie des logiciels musicaux, portant sur l’expérience utilisateur, l’éthique, le sentiment d’auctorialité et l’acceptabilité technologique.\r\n\r\nÀ propos de l’intervenant:\r\n\r\nPhilippe Pasquier est chercheur scientifique, artiste, enseignant et animateur de communauté. Il est directeur du Metacreation Lab for Creative AI, et professeur à la School for Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) de l’Université Simon Fraser, à Vancouver (Canada). Il y mène un programme multidisciplinaire de recherche-création axé sur les systèmes génératifs et l’IA appliquée aux tâches créatives, la créativité assistée par ordinateur et les systèmes cocréatifs.\r\n\r\nAvec les membres du Metacreation Lab, Philippe a co-signé plus de 250 contributions évaluées par les pairs, présentées dans les lieux scientifiques les plus exigeants, et a reçu neuf prix du meilleur article. Son cours en ligne (MOOC) sur l’art génératif et la créativité computationnelle, offert sur la plateforme Kadenze, rejoint des milliers de personnes.\r\n\r\nLes travaux artistiques du Metacreation Lab ont été présentés dans des lieux de renom sur six continents, notamment à Ars Electronica, à l’IRCAM, au ZKM, au Centre Pompidou, à Eastern Bloc, au festival Earzoom, à plusieurs éditions de l’ISEA, au festival Mutek, à la Biennale de Sydney, etc. Les projets du laboratoire trouvent également des applications industrielles, et ses algorithmes d’IA musicale ont touché des millions de personnes grâce à la mise à disposition en libre accès d’outils, de code et de jeux de données, ainsi qu’à des collaborations avec l’industrie du logiciel (p. ex. Steinberg, Teenage Engineering, Elias, Microsoft, Huawei, …).",
