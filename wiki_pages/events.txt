    "description": "**TIFU (Today I F'ed Up) by losing a ton of data for my research** - Have you ever seen a description like this on Reddit? Are your desktop and downloads folders a jumble of files named Data-finalFINAL-USETHISONE? Is all of your lab's data stored on a single drive located conveniently under a sprinkler system? Join research data management services and learn how investing a small amount of time in organizing your data now can save you a lot of time and prevent future headaches. In this introductory workshop, learn about research data management best practices. We will go over best practices for data planning, storage, organization, preservation, and sharing.\n\nBy the end of the session, participants will be empowered to:\n\n- Produce a plan for their data\n- Organize and document their data consistently\n- Store and back-up their data securely,\n- Select an appropriate data repository for archival and sharing.\n\nNo prior experience with data management is required! This session is perfect for anyone who wants to feel more confident organizing, storing, and sharing their data in clear and practical ways.\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/rdm25-26/intro-rdm2.html). This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared on the same page, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre's [Online Learning Catalogue.](https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/)\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** \n\nIsaac Pratt (he/him) is a research scientist by training and has a PhD in Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology. He leverages nearly a decade of interdisciplinary research experience to help support students, staff, and faculty. His expertise lies in questions surrounding data storage, security, planning, archival, and sharing. Isaac also provides support and curation services for McMaster Dataverse. His other interests include reproducible research methods, open science, and data science.\n\nDanica Evering holds expansive experience with research support, education, project management, advocacy, and knowledge translation; with fluency in social practice art, healthcare, community research, data, and systems development.

    "description": "Presenters: Kayhan Momeni (Dept. of Physics, U. of Toronto)\r\n\r\nThis session will describe our early experiences using the Trillium supercomputer to develop a next-generation Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) global ocean simulation. Our project will culminate in a run of the MITgcm with horizontal grid spacing of 1/96° (~1 km). It will be the highest-resolution realistic ocean model produced to date.\r\nThis simulation will contain several advances relative to the widely used 1/48° MITgcm simulation (also known as LLC4320), including increased vertical and horizontal resolution, an updated global bathymetry, the use of a more accurate surface pressure solver, the addition of ice-shelf cavities around Greenland and Antarctica, hourly atmospheric forcing, realistic river discharge, and more accurate astronomical tides. These improvements directly address long-standing issues in earlier high-resolution MITgcm simulations, for example, a misplaced Gulf Stream, a crude representation of Antarctic shelf currents, and anemic tropical instability waves.\r\nThe resulting model output will offer an unprecedented benchmark for studies of internal tides and internal waves, turbulence parameterization, and sea-surface height variability. All configurations, tools, and outputs will be openly released, positioning this Canada-led effort as a major global resource for oceanography and climate modelling.",

While floating-point numbers are inexact and have a (very) finite precision, they are also not mathematical real numbers. In addition, unlike mathematical real numbers, floating-point numbers are (in general) also neither associative nor distributive. This can result in problems with calculations' numerical stability and correctness using floating-point values. This talk will discuss this and some of the implied issues that one should be aware of when using floating-point numbers in program code.  \n---  \n  \nZoom account is required. Webinar registration is required. **VERY IMPORTANT:** During registration, you **have to provide the email address which is associated with your Zoom account**, otherwise you won't be able to register and/or attend the webinar!  Need help attending a webinar?

There are many ways to interact with a computer. Most of the time we click on things and select options with a cursor through a graphical user interface (GUI). A command line is exactly what it sounds like, a way of writing commands to your computer line by line and is incredibly powerful. In this workshop we will show you how to navigate through different parts of your system and introduce some of the most useful commands to be aware of.\n\nNo previous experience with the command line is required. This workshop is for beginners.\n\n**Pre-workshop setup**\n\nPlease have a laptop ready for this workshop. We will be using the Unix shell for most of the workshop. If you have a Mac or a Linux laptop you don't need to install or enable anything. If you are using a Windows 10 PC you will need to turn on the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” setting as per [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36465000). \n\nThis workshop is part of the [Core Skills](https://libcal.library.ubc.ca/calendar/vancouver/?t=g&amp;q=Core%20Skills&amp;cid=7544&amp;cal=7544&amp;inc=0)series. \n\n## Location Details\n\n\tLocation:\n\t*IN-PERSON and ONLINE* (synchronous)\n\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or accessibility needs please email **digital.scholarship@ubc.ca.**\n\nTo keep up-to-date with all of the workshops, consults, and events, [subscribe to the UBC Library Research Commons monthly newsletter](https://bit.ly/UBCRCNewsSubscribeEnvoke).\n\nThis event is in-person and online (synchronous).

Rather than focusing on a single software or technical workflow, participants will be introduced to a variety of methods, tools, and platforms to create maps or spatial representations. Participants will also be walked through key questions to manage research projects, and learn how to evaluate tools and workflows for their applicability to their projects.\n\nThink of this workshop as a wayfinding tutorial for navigating what questions to ask yourself at the beginning of a project comprising spatial data. By the end of this workshop series, participants will be able to:\n\n- Design a project to tell a spatial story with your data\n- Identify suitable methods/tools/platforms of spatial visualization to best represent research idea\n- Inventory and assemble the necessary resources to begin\n\nThough there will be an example project, participants are invited to bring their own projects/datasets to work through together.\n\nNot sure if this workshop is for you? Non-geospatial experts are welcome, especially those interested in spatial approaches to humanities research and data.\n\nThis workshop is taught by a graduate student in Geography with expertise in GIS and cartographic methods.\n\nWorkshop link:[https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-spatial-stories/](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-spatial-stories/)\n\n### Location details:\n\n\tLocation:\n\t*ONLINE*\n\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, or accessibility needs, please email **alexandra.alisauskas@ubc.ca**\n\nTo keep up-to-date with all our workshops, consults, and events, [subscribe to the UBC Library Research Commons monthly newsletter](https://bit.ly/UBCRCNewsSubscribeEnvoke).\n\nThis event is online.
