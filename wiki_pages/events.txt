However, what is the nature of it? What's the difference from the traditional computing model? How to access and use a cloud in particular for research purposes? \nThe Cloud Intro will clarify all of the above, starting with an overview of cloud computing including the evolution of HPC/ARC computer technologies, public &amp; private clouds, and the cloud deployed by Digital Research Alliance of Canada (Alliance), followed by an introduction to the national cloud sites, compute resources and different types of cloud storage such as volume, shared filesystem, and object storage. Finally, you will be guided on how to apply for/access those cloud resources as a pre-requisite of the following two sessions: Cloud Hands-on and Cloud Advanced. \n\nTo find other courses in this series, please visit:\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/research-computing/bootcamps.html",

This can range from hundreds of cores or several GPUs and some extra terabytes of storage to thousands of cores and hundreds of terabytes of storage. This annual competition is open for applications each October. This session will quickly cover the most important things to consider when submitting an application to maximize success and then open the floor to questions.\n\nTo find other courses in this series, please visit:\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/research-computing/bootcamps.html",

    "description": "In an era where data privacy is constantly under threat due to its value, it's important to understand what settings are available to you to best protect it. This presentation will provide you with practical, no-nonsense guidance on how to adjust privacy settings across various Microsoft products to ensure your research data remains confidential. You will be provided with a framework for assessing the privacy of software as a service provider and what you should be reviewing to help you identify potential risks and common pitfalls to avoid.\r\nWe'll dive into the often-overlooked privacy controls available in Windows, Microsoft 365, and other Azure-related services. You'll learn how to navigate these settings to protect and limit exposure to your information. We'll also discuss the implications of enabling connected experiences in Microsoft 365 and the privacy risks associated with features like Windows Recall and other recent additions.\r\nThis session is designed for researchers but will offer valuable information for anyone working with sensitive information who wants to ensure their data remains secure when using some of the most popular professional software available. By the end of this session, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the practical steps you can take to keep your research data private and protect yourself from accidental disclosure.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is offered by Taylor Bohn. Taylor is an Information Security Risk Advisor at UBC, supporting the university’s compliance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). Taylor conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) to help University initiatives of all sizes identify and mitigate privacy and information security risks. With a Bachelor of Commerce in Operations Management from the University of Saskatchewan and a self-taught foundation in IT gathering various certifications along the way, Taylor brings a practical, adaptive approach to risk management. His experience in IT spans Vancouver-based startups in both the finance and healthcare industries, with strengths in systems administration, business process improvement and automation. Besides reading privacy policies in his spare time Taylor is passionate about doing work that drives meaningful change and makes a positive impact on others.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Xxy7CJl8RBu0eOgzPD776Q)",

Not surprisingly, they are increasingly becoming integrated into many software, including text editors.  \nEmacs is no exception, and a number of packages have recently been developed to access models smoothly and directly. Of particular notice:\n- copilot.el brings GitHub Copilot's code completion to Emacs,\n- copilot-chat.el allows to chat, perform code review, code correction, code optimization, code transformation, and code explanation with GitHub Copilot in Emacs,\n- gptel allows access to any LLM from any buffer,\n- chatgpt-shell provides an Emacs shell to chat with any LLM.\nIn this webinar, I will demo these packages and show you how to install them and set things up.",
