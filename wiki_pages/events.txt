    "description": "In cybersecurity we are often asked to find and fix the gaps in our organizations defenses- uncovering and then fortifying the digital linchpins of our systems. What do you do when you find there isn't one linchpin but a pile, and the resilient machine you thought you had built is more like a shaking house of cards? The scourge of third-party dependencies in healthcare systems have continued to provide us with a steady stream of “lessons learned,” but is anyone showing up to class anymore? \r\n\r\nThis session will look at the speaker’s cross-sectional study that examined the impact of the faulty CrowdStrike software update on July 19, 2024 on patients and internet-connected services across US hospitals. This session will look at key business continuity and resilience takeaways from the Crowdstrike faulty software event and how these lessons can be applied toward not just health care, but other industry sectors as well.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n1) Identify supply chain and third-party risks inherent in complex industries such as healthcare.\r\n2) Identify impacts supply chain vulnerabilities can have on the timely delivery of life saving medical care.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is facilitated by Christian Dameff. Christian is an Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Biomedical Informatics, and Computer Science at the University of California San Diego. He co-directs the UCSD Center for Healthcare Cybersecurity. He is also a hacker, a former open capture the flag champion, and DEF CON/RSA/Black Hat/BSIDES Speaker.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3CkOofk2TGScI-2JhaSXEg)",

    "description": "Topic: \"**What exactly is a Resource Allocation Competition (RAC) Compute Award?**\"  \nSpeaker: James Desjardins, SHARCNET  \n[Registration link](https://sharcnet-ca.zoom.us/meeting/register/Y-NeQIABTiODRvSf3c_dvA)  \n  \n---   \nThe Resource Allocation Competition (RAC) gives researchers the opportunity to request and be awarded quantities of storage, cloud and/or compute resources. In the case of storage and cloud, the resources awarded can be directly translated into what is made available to the researcher on the cluster (e.g. a 100TB storage allocation translates directly into a 100TB quota on a file system). For CPU or GPU compute awards, however, the translation of CPU or GPU years awarded to what is made available to the researcher is not as direct of a translation. Rather, a RAC compute allocation is implemented as a target share of the compute resources on a cluster for an account. The target share is a key factor in determining the priority of the account’s jobs in the queue based on the recent usage achieved by the account. This presentation describes how compute allocations are implemented on the clusters, covering topics like the relationship between Rapid Access Services (RAS) compute shares and RAC allocations, expected vs unexpected wait times, and monitoring the progress of using a compute allocation.   \n---  \n  \nZoom account is required. Webinar registration is required. **VERY IMPORTANT:** During registration, you **have to provide the email address which is associated with your Zoom account**, otherwise you won't be able to register and/or attend the webinar!  Need help attending a webinar?
