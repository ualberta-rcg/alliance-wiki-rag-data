    "description": "DMP Assistant has quite a year for cybersecurity in 2024-25. In September 2024, we navigated a cybersecurity incident, which (thankfully) did not expose any user data. The response was a tense several days while the service team worked quickly to remediate the issue and better respond to a landscape that had changed significantly over the years. Later in the year, we worked with Alliance Cybersecurity on a penetration test by an outside contractor to test the application itself and new infrastructure as we migrated the platform.\r\n\r\nThis presentation discusses working in and responding to cybersecurity issues in a small team, and provides some lessons learned along the way to highlight everyday considerations that may be useful to a broad audience of technology users.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is hosted by Marcus Closen. Marcus is product lead, data management planning with the Digital Research Alliance of Canada, where he oversees strategy and development of DMP Assistant, a national, bi-lingual platform to support researchers developing data management plans. Marcus is also in the later stages of completing a PhD in political science at the University of Toronto, where he gained experience in computational social science and working with complex data in both quantitative and qualitative settings.
