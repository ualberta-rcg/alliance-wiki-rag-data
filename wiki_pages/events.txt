    "description": "[Register](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdv8ZTK1-Nx1JZ823hNX4Mpipjw4LPjLokUWR43MIigLcSJog/viewform)  \n   \nAbstract: This example-based course takes you through the initial steps necessary to go from your own data to a trained model. It uses a computer vision classification problem as the study case and a modern and efficiency-oriented stack of libraries as the tools, including:\n- Polars for faster DataFrames,\n- ImageIO for reading in images into ndarrays,\n- PyTorch or Grain for datasets classes and dataloaders,\n- PIX for data augmentation,\n- JAX for JIT compilation, accelerators use, automatic vectorization, and automatic differentiation,\n- Flax for neural networks building,\n- Orbax for checkpointing,\n- Optax for optimization.\nThe main objective is to help you get started with deep learning by explaining concepts such as dataset classes, data loaders, data augmentation, training, etc. as we move along our study case.  \nWhile deep learning concepts are relatively simple, it is often a frustrating affair to get anything to work and to adapt documentation or online tutorials to your own data. By walking through this together, we will hopefully make this part less challenging when you try it on your own. Along the way, I will introduce core JAX concepts and get you started with this powerful library.  \nThis course doesn't have prerequisites, although some knowledge of Python, NumPy, and a basic understanding of neural networks help.",

    "description": "Research data management, or RDM, is increasingly recognized as an important part of the research enterprise in all disciplines. With the introduction of the [Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy](https://science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_97610.html), and the broad recognition of principles such as [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care), and [OCAP](https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/), it’s crucial for anyone conducting research to understand and adopt good RDM practices. This workshop will give you an overview of the essentials of RDM, including information about sharing and depositing data, managing sensitive data, and data management plans (DMPs).\n\nThis session is primarily intended for graduate students, faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and staff engaged in research outside of the classroom setting. For undergraduate students conducting research for a class, please contact your [subject librarian](https://library.ucalgary.ca/services/mylibrarian#find-librarians).\n\nFor those who would like a more in-depth session on DMPs, please consider also attending the [Introduction to Data Management Plans workshop](https://workrooms.ucalgary.ca/event/3947903) on January 6. For information on other skills related to RDM, please consider the [Personal Digital Archving workshop](https://workrooms.ucalgary.ca/event/3948331) on January 7, and/or [Digital File Management workshop](https://workrooms.ucalgary.ca/event/3951461) on January 8.",

Despite the title, this course is suitable for many physical scientists (chemists, astronomers, ...).\n\tThere are three ways to follow this course:As a graduate course for UofT PhD and MSc students. Students that wish to do so, should not self-enrol here, but enrol using ACORN/ROSI.As a SciNet or Alliance user taking the course for SciNet certificate credits; for that, enrol on this site (note: limited spots).As an auditor following along with recordings but not submitting assignments; for this no enrollment is needed.This is a hybrid in-person/virtual course.  ",
