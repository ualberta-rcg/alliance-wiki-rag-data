Specifically, all the terms such as: thread, process, job, vector processor, core, CUDA, MPI and many more. This session will provide you with a map to understand parallel computing, a description of the terms and concepts and how they relate to each other. Like any good map, it will let you know which concepts and terms you need to know in greater detail, and how they relate to what you are trying to do. With this map in hand, you will be in a better position to decide when and how to take advantage of the parallel computing architectures that are available to you. This workshop will include a simple and practical live demonstration running and viewing different types of parallel programs/concepts on an HPC cluster.\n\nTo find other courses in this series, please visit:\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/research-computing/bootcamps.html",

    "description": "Are you curious about organizing your research better? Join us for our first roundtable of the season **September 25 from 11 AM - 12 PM** **on Research and Lab Notebooks**.\n\nNotebooks are important records of decision-making, results, and processes during research. Although many researchers still use paper notebooks, electronic tools protect against data loss, enhance searching, and validate findings through permissions and signatures. While McMaster University does not offer dedicated software, we'll hear from researchers across disciplines about how they're making it work with available tools. We'll talk configuring workflows, setting up version control, which tools you avoid, onboarding students and new researchers, and other practical details.\n\nAround the table this month:\n\n- [Dr. Sara Andres](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/andressn) (Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences) introduces how she's configured **OneNote**\n- [Dr. Andrew McArthur](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/mcarthua) (Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences) shares his **GitLab **setup\n- [Akacia Propst](https://anthropology.mcmaster.ca/people/) (The/La Collaborative - Philosophy) discusses a **Research Documentation** template\n- [Dr. Andy Roddick](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/roddick) (Anthropology) outlines using **Obsidian** to build connections in a mass of information\n\n[Here is the meeting link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a1c5cab600046442e9ca22dbf61906391%40thread.tacv2/1755540378817?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2244376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22929fd809-7cb8-438c-93bc-f6bff66ea33a%22%7d).

We will learn about batch and interactive cluster usage, best practices for submitting a large number of jobs, estimating your job's resource requirements, and managing file permissions in shared cluster filesystems.  \nThere will be many demos and hands-on exercises on our training cluster.",

Now what? How do you figure out what resources your jobs need on the cluster? What do you do when things go wrong? This workshop will share secrets of interactive cluster usage so you can schedule work efficiently, learn how to fix problems when things go wrong and use the system for interactive code development. High performance computing (HPC) clusters are composed of Linux machines, understanding and controlling work on a cluster is an extension of the skills in doing the same on a Linux machine. You will learn how to debug by telling how many resources: memory, open files, how much disk IO, Iops and how much network traffic a program uses.\n\nTo find other courses in this series, please visit:\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/research-computing/bootcamps.html",

    "description": "Surveys remain one of the most widely used tools for studying how people think and act. This session examines their strengths and limitations in understanding political attitudes and behaviours, particularly in contexts of high political polarization. We will consider the practical and methodological difficulties of online survey research, including recruitment, response bias, data quality, and tracking attitudes over time. Drawing on evidence from Viewpoint Alberta, a large, multi-year survey project examining the political attitudes and behaviours of Albertans, we will discuss lessons for designing surveys that balance rigour with feasibility in contemporary political research.\r\n\r\nThis talk will double as both the first webinar in the HSS Spotlight series, sponsored by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada, and as the launch seminar of the Transforming Research for Social Impact hub (https://www.ualberta.ca/en/social-sciences-humanities/initiatives/transforming-research-for-social-impact-hub/index.html) at the University of Alberta. The TRSI Hub is the first pan-university initiative in Alberta focused on developing innovative methodologies that promote community-driven social change and address complex social issues. The Hub responds to a rapidly changing world of social research by offering comprehensive social research methods training and advancement targeted toward social impact.\r\n\r\nSpeakers:\r\nDr. Feo Snagovsky is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Alberta. His research focuses on the comparative analysis of elections and political behaviour – particularly in the role that political elites play in shaping identity and public opinion. His work has been published in Party Politics, Parliamentary Affairs, Government and Opposition, Electoral Studies, the Canadian Journal of Political Science and the Australian Journal of Political Science. His current research examines conspiracy theory belief and support for democracy.\r\n\r\nEvan Walker is a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Alberta. Having completed his Master's studies at the U of A, Evan’s research interests centre around populism, political behaviour, and occasionally political economy. Evan aims to mesh his background in Political Science, Economics, and Geography to help better understand public opinion.",
