All previous versions of files are saved and you can even revert to a previous version. Git is a version control software. Git-portal sites, like GitHub or GitLab, offer many useful features to facilitate collaborative development.\n\nThis is the first workshop of a two-part series. The first session focuses on version control. The second explores using Git for collaborative development.\n\nThis beginner level session will introduce you to Git. We will show you how to create a repository, record changes to files, explore and restore from the recorded history and how to resolve conflicts (when one member overwrites another’s changes).",

However, its performance often lags behind traditional compiled languages like C, C++, and Fortran, as well as newer contenders like Julia and Chapel. This course is designed to help you speed up your Python workflows using a variety of tools and techniques.  \nWe’ll begin with classic optimization methods such as NumPy-based vectorization, and explore just-in-time compilation using Numba, along with performance profiling techniques. From there, we’ll delve into parallelization – starting with multithreading using external libraries like NumExpr and Python 3.13’s new free-threading capabilities – but placing greater emphasis on multiprocessing.  \nNext, we’ll dive into Ray, a powerful and flexible framework for scaling Python applications. While Ray is widely used in AI, our focus will be on its core capabilities for distributed computing and data processing. You’ll learn how to parallelize CPU-bound numerical workflows – with and without reduction – as well as optimize I/O-bound tasks. We’ll also explore combining Ray with Numba and will discuss coding tightly coupled parallel problems.",

    "description": "Do you want to analyze outcomes like disease presence, voting behavior, or customer churn? Logistic regression is a powerful method for modeling binary outcomes and understanding how different factors influence the likelihood of an event. In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn how to use R to build and interpret logistic regression models, helping you make informed decisions based on your data.\n\nThis workshop introduces logistic regression using R, with a focus on practical applications and interpretation. In this session, participants will:\n\n- Understand foundational concepts of logistic regression\n\n- Learn how to structure and prepare data for logistic regression analysis\n\n- Use the `glm()` function in R to fit multiple logistic regression models\n\n- Interpret model coefficients, including odds ratios\n\n- Evaluate the performance and fit of logistic regression models\n\nThis session is ideal for participants who have some experience with R and are ready to explore statistical modeling in a supportive, practical setting. Attending the linear regression workshop or having prior familiarity with linear regression concepts will enhance your learning experience in this session, but it is not required.\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/dash25-26/logistic-regression.html). This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared on the same page, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre's [Online Learning Catalogue.](https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/)\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** Sahar is a PhD candidate in the Health Research Methodology program at McMaster University with a background in midwifery. She supports researchers in data analysis using statistical software such as R, SAS, and SPSS, research methodology, and evidence synthesis.\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program. For more information, visit [scds.ca/certificate-program](http://scds.ca/certificate-program). \n\n**Credit Eligibility: **This workshop counts toward credit for students in the Faculty of Science who are enrolled in SCIENCE 2SF1: Digital Skills Workshop.

If you're in the process of creating a DMP, either for a grant application or for your own research, join RDM Services for this afternoon session. The RDM services team will provide tailored guidance as you write your plan on site, and we'll have some light snacks and refreshments to keep you going. Come away with a clear path forward or even a finished DMP!\n\nBy the end of this session, participants will be able to:\n\n- Identify the 5 key components of a data management plan (DMP).\n- Compare strong and weak responses in each section of a DMP.\n- Develop a tailored outline, or potentially a complete draft, of their own DMP!\n\nThis participatory session is especially relevant for researchers at all levels in the beginning stages of a research project or streamlining best practices for their research team. Come on your own, send your research staff, or bring your whole research group.
