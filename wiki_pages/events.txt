Learn resource-sharing techniques to transform how you use your GPUs. Maximize your computational efficiency through the use of fractional GPUs or by sharing resources between multiple jobs and tasks. This hands-on workshop is particularly essential for users of powerful H100 systems, as poor GPU utilization leads to wasted resources, lower job priority, and potential job termination.\n\nPlan:\n\n* Why bother maximizing GPU usage\n* How to waste GPU cycles\n* CUDA streams\n* Wasting less GPU resources with the MIGs\n* Sharing one GPU between multiple tasks with the MPS\n* TimeSlicing\n* Lots of exercises (executing jobs on the cluster, running tests, measuring execution times, etc)",

    "description": "Let us be your body double with this in-person bootcamp! Data Management Plans (DMPs) are both incredibly helpful research tools and increasingly required for grants but it can hard to know how to complete a Data Management Plan if it’s your first time. If you're in the process of creating a DMP, either for a grant application or for your own research, join RDM Services for this afternoon session. The RDM services team will provide tailored guidance as you write your plan on site, and we'll have some light snacks and refreshments to keep you going. Come away with a clear path forward or even a finished DMP!\n\nBy the end of this session, participants will be able to:\n\n- Identify the 5 key components of a data management plan (DMP).\n- Compare strong and weak responses in each section of a DMP.\n- Develop a tailored outline, or potentially a complete draft, of their own DMP!\n\nThis participatory session is especially relevant for researchers at all levels in the beginning stages of a research project or streamlining best practices for their research team. Come on your own, send your research staff, or bring your whole research group. Let us know if you're joining as a research team - we'll make sure you get a table to work together at!\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/rdm25-26/dmp-bootcamp2.html). This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared on the same page, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre's [Online Learning Catalogue.](https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/)\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** Isaac Pratt (he/him) is a research scientist by training and has a PhD in Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology. He leverages nearly a decade of interdisciplinary research experience to help support students, staff, and faculty. His expertise lies in questions surrounding data storage, security, planning, archival, and sharing. Isaac also provides support and curation services for McMaster Dataverse. His other interests include reproducible research methods, open science, and data science.\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program.

    "description": "This set of five workshops is an introduction to Python programming, with a focus on skills that are relevant to students and researchers who are working with data, particularly tabular data.\n\nThe five workshops cover the following:\n\n- Part 1: To understand the basics of Python syntax, variables, and data types.\n- Part 2: To learn how to work with tabular data in Python, including reading, manipulating, and visualizing data.\n- Part 3: To learn how to automate tasks in Python, including working with multiple files.\n- Part 4: To learn to use logic and modularity to make Python code flexible and reusable.\n- Part 5: To develop good habits for programming for research in Python, including handling errors, debugging, and writing reliable code.\n\nParticipants must sign up for each workshop individually. It is not necessary to sign up for the first workshop in order to do the second (and so on), but note that each workshop will build on the topics covered in previous workshops in this series.\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\nThere are no prerequisites needed for this series; no prior programming experience is required.\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n\nIn these workshops, we will write Python code in a text editor called Visual Studio Code (VS Code).\n\nPlease follow the following steps/links to complete the setup for this workshop series before you attend:\n\n1. Install a [Python Interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter)\n2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n3. Install the [Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). If you want more info on installing extensions for VS Code, [see this page on their “Extension Marketplace”](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace)\n4. Install this [Python Debugger extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy)\n\n**NOTE:** You may use your own preferred text editor or Jupyter Notebooks to write code in these workshops, but keep in mind that some aspects may be unpredictably different from the way things appear on the instructor's screen. For example, the instructor will frequently use the Python Debugger in VS Code, and other text editors may have entirely different mechanisms for debugging, and you may have to figure that out on your own. If you want to follow what the instructor is doing exactly, you should install VS Code and the extensions listed above.\n\n### Location details:\n\n\tLocation:\n\t*IN-PERSON and ONLINE* (synchronous)\n\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, or accessibility needs, please email **[digital.scholarship@ubc.ca](mailto:digital.scholarship@ubc.ca).**\n\nTo keep up-to-date with all our workshops, consults, and events, [subscribe to the UBC Library Research Commons monthly newsletter](https://bit.ly/UBCRCNewsSubscribeEnvoke).\n\nThis event is in-person and online (synchronous). Registrants receive the online link 3 hours before the event. Registration closes at that time.",
