    "description": "Research data management, or RDM, is increasingly recognized as an important part of the research enterprise in all disciplines. With the introduction of the [Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy](https://science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_97610.html), and the broad recognition of principles such as [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care), and [OCAP](https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/), it’s crucial for anyone conducting research to understand and adopt good RDM practices. This workshop will give you an overview of the essentials of RDM, including information about sharing and depositing data, managing sensitive data, and data management plans (DMPs).\n\nThis session is primarily intended for graduate students, faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and staff engaged in research outside of the classroom setting. For undergraduate students conducting research for a class, please contact your [subject librarian](https://library.ucalgary.ca/services/mylibrarian#find-librarians).\n\nFor those who would like a more in-depth session on DMPs, please consider also attending the [Introduction to Data Management Plans workshop](https://workrooms.ucalgary.ca/event/3947903) on January 6. For information on other skills related to RDM, please consider the [Personal Digital Archving workshop](https://workrooms.ucalgary.ca/event/3948331) on January 7, and/or [Digital File Management workshop](https://workrooms.ucalgary.ca/event/3951461) on January 8.",

Topics include well-established best practices for developing software as it applies to scientific computations, common numerical techniques and packages, and aspects of high performance computing. While we will introduce the C++ language, in one language or another, students should already have some programming experience. Despite the title, this course is suitable for many physical scientists (chemists, astronomers, ...).\n\tThere are three ways to follow this course:As a graduate course for UofT PhD and MSc students. Students that wish to do so, should not self-enrol here, but enrol using ACORN/ROSI.As a SciNet or Alliance user taking the course for SciNet certificate credits; for that, enrol on this site (note: limited spots).As an auditor following along with recordings but not submitting assignments; for this no enrollment is needed.This is a hybrid in-person/virtual course.  ",

Are your desktop and downloads folders a jumble of files named Data-finalFINAL-USETHISONE? Is all of your lab's data stored on a single drive located conveniently under a sprinkler system? Join research data management services and learn how investing a small amount of time in organizing your data now can save you a lot of time and prevent future headaches. In this introductory workshop, learn about research data management best practices. We will go over best practices for data planning, storage, organization, preservation, and sharing.\n\nBy the end of the session, participants will be empowered to:\n\n- Produce a plan for their data\n- Organize and document their data consistently\n- Store and back-up their data securely,\n- Select an appropriate data repository for archival and sharing.\n\nNo prior experience with data management is required! This session is perfect for anyone who wants to feel more confident organizing, storing, and sharing their data in clear and practical ways.\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/rdm25-26/intro-rdm2.html). This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared on the same page, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre's [Online Learning Catalogue.](https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/)\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** \n\nIsaac Pratt (he/him) is a research scientist by training and has a PhD in Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology. He leverages nearly a decade of interdisciplinary research experience to help support students, staff, and faculty. His expertise lies in questions surrounding data storage, security, planning, archival, and sharing. Isaac also provides support and curation services for McMaster Dataverse. His other interests include reproducible research methods, open science, and data science.\n\nDanica Evering holds expansive experience with research support, education, project management, advocacy, and knowledge translation; with fluency in social practice art, healthcare, community research, data, and systems development. Danica supports students, postdocs, faculty, and staff with RDM through the data lifecycle—Data Management Plans, storage and backup, data security, data sharing. With an MA in Media Studies from Concordia, they are interested in fostering RDM within curious scholars and disciplines.\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program. For more information, visit [scds.ca/certificate-program](http://scds.ca/certificate-program). It is also eligible for the Canadian Certificate for Digital Humanities. To learn more, visit [ccdhhn.ca](http://ccdhhn.ca) or contact [scds@mcmaster.ca](mailto:scds@mcmaster.ca).\n\n**Credit Eligibility: **This workshop counts toward credit for students in the Faculty of Science who are enrolled in SCIENCE 2SF1: Digital Skills Workshop.
