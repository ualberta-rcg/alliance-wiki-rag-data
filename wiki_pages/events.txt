This lack of interpretability raises challenges in trust, accountability, and model debugging. In this talk, we explore Integrated Gradients, a principled method for attributing a model’s prediction to its input features. By integrating gradients of the model’s output with respect to its inputs along a path from a baseline to the actual input, this technique provides a mathematically grounded way to identify which features most influence the outcome. We will discuss the theoretical foundations of integrated gradients, their advantages over simpler attribution methods, and practical examples that illustrate how they reveal meaningful insights about model behavior.\n\n---\n\n  \n_The Compute Ontario Colloquia are weekly Zoom presentations on Advanced Research Computing, High Performance Computing, Research Data Management, and Research Software topics, delivered by staff from three Compute Ontario consortia (CAC, SciNet, SHARCNET) and guest speakers. The series began January 2023 and superseded similar series previously delivered by individual consortia (e.g. General Interest Seminars by SHARCNET or User Group Meeting TechTalks by SciNet). The colloquia are one hour long and include time for questions. No registration is required. Presentations are usually recorded and uploaded to the hosting consortium video channel (colloquia hosted by SHARCNET go to [our youtube channel](http://youtube.sharcnet.ca))._",

This tutorial is full of short exercises and code examples. It is directed to undergraduate or graduate students interested in learning R to apply it in assignments, projects, or theses but with no programming experience.\n\nPart 1 (Aug 25 @ 4) covers using operators, expressions, variables, and built-in functions in R. Understanding assignment and how arguments work when calling functions. The data types and structures R offers to model data. Introduction to vectors. Part 2 (Aug 26 @ 4) covers the remaining data structures to model and manipulate data: factors, matrices, arrays, lists, and finally, the workhorse of data analysis, the data frame. We will study the basics of subsetting and ordering for data structures. Finally, we will have a look at user functions and basic control flow.",
