Unix shells thus allow the creation of reproducible workflows and the automation of repetitive tasks. They also allow to securely access remote machines and HPC clusters.  \nThis course is a hands-on introduction to Bash and Zsh. It will teach you to login to the Alliance supercomputers and covers common commands, loops, redirections, functions, wildcards, aliases, and scripting.",

Used by researchers across many disciplines to tackle analyses too large or complex for a desktop, or to achieve improved efficiency over a desktop, this session takes participants through the preliminary stages of learning about high performance computing (HPC) and computing clusters, and how to get started with this type of computing. It then reviews software packages available for applications, data analysis, software development and compiling code. Finally, participants will be introduced to the concept of parallel computing to achieve much faster results in analysis.
