    "description": "We present DoomArena, a security evaluation framework for AI agents. DoomArena is designed on three principles: 1) It is a plug-in framework and integrates easily into realistic agentic frameworks like BrowserGym (for web agents) and τ-bench (for tool calling agents); 2) It is configurable and allows for detailed threat modeling, allowing configuration of specific components of the agentic framework being attackable, and specifying targets for the attacker; and 3) It is modular and decouples the development of attacks from details of the environment in which the agent is deployed, allowing for the same attacks to be applied across multiple environments. \r\n\r\nWe illustrate several advantages of our framework, including the ability to adapt to new threat models and environments easily, the ability to easily combine several previously published attacks to enable comprehensive and fine-grained security testing, and the ability to analyze trade-offs between various vulnerabilities and performance. \r\n\r\nWe apply DoomArena to state-of-the-art (SOTA) web and tool-calling agents and find a number of surprising results: 1) SOTA agents have varying levels of vulnerability to different threat models (malicious user vs malicious environment), and there is no Pareto dominant agent across all threat models; 2) When multiple attacks are applied to an agent, they often combine constructively; 3) Guardrail model-based defenses seem to fail, while defenses based on powerful SOTA LLMs work better.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is facilitated by Léo Boisvert. Léo  is a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal and MILA, specializing in AI security and web agents. His research focuses on developing secure LLM-based systems, through benchmarks and frameworks including WorkArena++ and DoomArena. Leo bridges technical innovation with public understanding through his column on Radio-Canada's. His work has been published in top-tier venues including NeurIPS and TMLR, contributing to both the technical advancement and ethical implementation of AI systems.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_VyN_7JhjR1-1CWgGDlQVjA)",

    "description": "Canada’s agri-food sector—central to national security, economic stability, and public health—is becoming a high-value target for cyber attackers. From ransomware locking robotic milking systems to attacks that have resulted in livestock deaths, the threats facing agricultural operations are no longer hypothetical. This talk exposes the real and rising cyber risks in smart farming environments and explains why Canada's agri-food sector is now one of its most vulnerable critical infrastructures.\r\n\r\nDrawing on real-world case studies—including a ransomware attack on a Canadian dairy farm and an incident in Switzerland where system failure led to the death of a cow and its unborn calf—this session illustrates the devastating impact of cyber attacks on food production and animal welfare. The presentation highlights the evolving threat landscape, including opportunistic criminals, state-sponsored groups, and increasingly, hacktivists targeting farming operations for ideological reasons.\r\n\r\nAttendees will gain practical insights into key mitigation steps, including how to select the right cybersecurity experts, conduct self-assessments, and implement managed monitoring solutions. The session also discusses why many traditional tools (like antivirus software) are insufficient for protecting cyber-physical systems in ag-tech.\r\n\r\nThe talk concludes with an interactive tabletop exercise where participants will simulate a ransomware attack response at a dairy farm, experiencing firsthand the operational, ethical, and strategic challenges involved.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is a call to action for producers, policymakers, and technology vendors: protecting Canada’s food systems from cyber threats isn’t just IT’s job—it’s everyone’s responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is facilitated by Dr. Ali Dehghantanha. Dr. Dehghantanha is a leading academic-entrepreneur and thought leader in AI security. He is the co-founder and CEO of Avaly.AI, a company dedicated to building security for an AI-First world.\r\n\r\nAs a Canada Research Chair in Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence, Dr. Dehghantanha is also the founding director of the Canada Cyber Foundry at the University of Guelph, a center focused on advancing cybersecurity education, innovation, and industry collaboration.\r\n\r\nHe established and leads the Master of Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence program, as well as the Master of Leadership in Cybersecurity and Cyberpreneurship, equipping the next generation of cybersecurity professionals and innovators with the skills to navigate an AI-driven security landscape.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_66KDaayxTfGKAH3T9OiVVg)",

    "description": "[Register](https://forms.gle/EPagTRjeM2L27t857)  \n   \nAbstract: Project Jupyter was extremely innovative when, back in 2011, they built an open-source Notebook on top of the IPython shell (itself an improvement over the Python shell). Notebooks proved an extremely popular tool for literate programming and are widely used today.  \n  \nThey do however come with two major issues:  \n\n1. They are a nightmare for version control. The JSON-like format of the .ipynb files used by Jupyter makes versioning a challenge without the use of proprietary tools or hacky back and forth conversions with, for instance, jupytext.\n2. It is easy to forget to rerun cells in order and publish a non-reproducible notebook. A study of 10 million notebooks published on GitHub fond that 36% of them had been run in a non-linear fashion.\nMarimo is a new generation of open-source notebook for Python that addresses these problems by using a dataflow graph under the hood ensuring that cells remain up to date and using .py as its file format. Marimo notebooks also provide excellent interactivity with direct synchronization with the Python kernel. Consequently, these new notebooks have seen a surge in popularity since their launch in 2023.  \n  \nIn this webinar, I will demo the installation and usage of marimo notebooks.",

Modern GPUs (such as NVIDIA A100 and H100) are massively parallel and very expensive devices. Most of GPU jobs are incapable of utilizing these GPUs efficiently, either due to the problem size being too small to saturate the GPU, or due to the intermittent (bursty) GPU utilization pattern. This course will teach you how to measure the GPU utilization of your jobs on our clusters, and show how to use the two NVIDIA technologies - MPS (Multi-Process Service) and MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) - to improve GPU utilization.\n\nThis course is self-paced, but will also be given live on **Tues. Oct. 28,** and **Tues. Nov. 4** from **1 P.M. to 2 P.M.** Eastern Time. Recordings of live classes will be available afterwards in this course for self-paced learning and review.\n\n  \n  \nAccess is restricted to Digital Research Alliance of Canada (formerly Compute Canada) authenticated users only.",
