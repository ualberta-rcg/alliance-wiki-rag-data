    "description": "This introductory workshop is targeted toward scholars, practitioners, and researchers who are interested in finding ways to represent their data and research materials spatially. Rather than focusing on a single software or technical workflow, participants will be introduced to a variety of methods, tools, and platforms to create maps or spatial representations. Participants will also be walked through key questions to manage research projects, and learn how to evaluate tools and workflows for their applicability to their projects.\n\nThink of this workshop as a wayfinding tutorial for navigating what questions to ask yourself at the beginning of a project comprising spatial data. By the end of this workshop series, participants will be able to:\n\n- Design a project to tell a spatial story with your data\n- Identify suitable methods/tools/platforms of spatial visualization to best represent research idea\n- Inventory and assemble the necessary resources to begin\n\nThough there will be an example project, participants are invited to bring their own projects/datasets to work through together.\n\nNot sure if this workshop is for you? Non-geospatial experts are welcome, especially those interested in spatial approaches to humanities research and data.\n\nThis workshop is taught by a graduate student in Geography with expertise in GIS and cartographic methods.\n\nWorkshop link:[https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-spatial-stories/](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-spatial-stories/)\n\n### Location details:\n\n\tLocation:\n\t*ONLINE*\n\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, or accessibility needs, please email **alexandra.alisauskas@ubc.ca**\n\nTo keep up-to-date with all our workshops, consults, and events, [subscribe to the UBC Library Research Commons monthly newsletter](https://bit.ly/UBCRCNewsSubscribeEnvoke).\n\nThis event is online.
