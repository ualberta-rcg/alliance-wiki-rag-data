    "description": "Interested in digital mapping, but unsure of where to start? This beginner-focused workshop introduces you to the fundamentals of geographic data and teaches you how to create digital maps using QGIS, a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS). QGIS is available free of charge to everyone, including current students, staff, and faculty at McMaster University. It’s a great starting point for anyone looking to explore mapping in their research, projects, or creative work.\n\nBy the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:\n\n- Describe what geographic data is and explain the basic functions of geographic information systems (GIS)\n- Identify and navigate the main components of the QGIS graphical user interface.\n- Access and use geospatial web services within QGIS.\n- Understand the purpose of coordinate reference systems and apply them in QGIS.\n- Create a basic map layout using the QGIS print layout tool.\n\nAbsolutely no geography or quantitative background is necessary for an engaging experience. This session is great for beginners who are curious about mapping and want to explore how geographic data can be used to create digital maps with QGIS.\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/dash25-26/intro-qgis-1.html). This workshop will not be recorded.\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** Saman’s (she/her) work operates at the intersection of information science and critical geography. She’s particularly interested in the ways in which community-owned and -governed infrastructure can contribute to equitable knowledge systems. Currently, Saman takes care of McMaster’s Lloyd Reeds Map Collection, ensuring community members are able to access, understand, and use the collection for teaching and research.\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program. For more information, visit [scds.ca/certificate-program](http://scds.ca/certificate-program). \n\n**Credit Eligibility: **This workshop counts toward credit for students in the Faculty of Science who are enrolled in SCIENCE 2SF1: Digital Skills Workshop.

In the first talk of the series ([https://youtu.be/YPQUIkSIFhw](https://youtu.be/YPQUIkSIFhw)), we covered Xeus-Cling ([https://github.com/arminms/xeus-cling-jupyter](https://github.com/arminms/xeus-cling-jupyter)) and G3P ([https://github.com/arminms/g3p](https://github.com/arminms/g3p)). In the second part, after some updates about xeus-cling-jupyter (e.g. support for C++20), we learn how to use a parallel random number library like Ranx ([https://github.com/arminms/ranx](https://github.com/arminms/ranx)), together with STL's algorithms and distributions, for generating random numbers. The whole series is available as an executable book ([https://executablebooks.org](https://executablebooks.org)) at [https://arminms.github.io/high-performance-data-science-with-modern-cpp](https://arminms.github.io/high-performance-data-science-with-modern-cpp) .  \n---  \n  \nZoom account is required.

    "description": "This set of five workshops is an introduction to Python programming, with a focus on skills that are relevant to students and researchers who are working with data, particularly tabular data.\n\nThe five workshops cover the following:\n\n- Part 1: To understand the basics of Python syntax, variables, and data types.\n- Part 2: To learn how to work with tabular data in Python, including reading, manipulating, and visualizing data.\n- Part 3: To learn how to automate tasks in Python, including working with multiple files.\n- Part 4: To learn to use logic and modularity to make Python code flexible and reusable.\n- Part 5: To develop good habits for programming for research in Python, including handling errors, debugging, and writing reliable code.\n\nParticipants must sign up for each workshop individually. It is not necessary to sign up for the first workshop in order to do the second (and so on), but note that each workshop will build on the topics covered in previous workshops in this series.\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\nThere are no prerequisites needed for this series; no prior programming experience is required.\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n\nIn these workshops, we will write Python code in a text editor called Visual Studio Code (VS Code).\n\nPlease follow the following steps/links to complete the setup for this workshop series before you attend:\n\n1. Install a [Python Interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter)\n2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n3. Install the [Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). If you want more info on installing extensions for VS Code, [see this page on their “Extension Marketplace”](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace)\n4. Install this [Python Debugger extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy)\n\n**NOTE:** You may use your own preferred text editor or Jupyter Notebooks to write code in these workshops, but keep in mind that some aspects may be unpredictably different from the way things appear on the instructor's screen. For example, the instructor will frequently use the Python Debugger in VS Code, and other text editors may have entirely different mechanisms for debugging, and you may have to figure that out on your own. If you want to follow what the instructor is doing exactly, you should install VS Code and the extensions listed above.\n\n### Location details:\n\n\tLocation:\n\t*IN-PERSON and ONLINE* (synchronous)\n\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, or accessibility needs, please email **[digital.scholarship@ubc.ca](mailto:digital.scholarship@ubc.ca).**\n\nTo keep up-to-date with all our workshops, consults, and events, [subscribe to the UBC Library Research Commons monthly newsletter](https://bit.ly/UBCRCNewsSubscribeEnvoke).\n\nThis event is in-person and online (synchronous). Registrants receive the online link 3 hours before the event. Registration closes at that time.",

    "description": "Our popular DMP Bootcamp is back, reformatted into a hands-on online intensive for remote researchers on the go! Data Management Plans (DMPs) are both incredibly helpful research tools and increasingly required for grants but it can hard to know how to complete a Data Management Plan if it’s your first time. If you're in the process of creating a DMP, either for a grant application or for your own research, join RDM Services for this afternoon session. The RDM Services team will provide tailored guidance as you write your plan online--we'll pop into your breakout rooms to make sure everything is going smoothy. Come away with a clear path forward or even a finished DMP!\n\nBy the end of this session, participants will be able to:\n\n- Identify the 5 key components of a data management plan (DMP).\n- Compare strong and weak responses in each section of a DMP.\n- Develop a tailored outline, or potentially a complete draft, of their own DMP!\n\nThis participatory session is especially relevant for researchers at all levels in the beginning stages of a research project or streamlining best practices for their research team. Come on your own, send your research staff, or bring your whole research group. Let us know if you're joining as a research team - we'll make sure you get an online breakout room to work together in! Bring your own snacks to your desk and enjoy this dedicated time to work on your plan with extra support.\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/rdm25-26/dmp-bootcamp1.html). This workshop will not be recorded.\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** Danica Evering (they/them) is a Research Data Management Specialist grounded in curiosity and a deep commitment to ethics. Danica is available to help students, postdocs, faculty, and staff with RDM through the data lifecycle—Data Management Plans, storage and backup, data security, data sharing. With an MA in Media Studies, Danica fosters active interest in RDM across disciplines, with a knack for engaging researchers who might not even realize they have data to manage. Outside of work they sing in a choir, play PC games, maintain an art writing practice, grow a garden, contribute Wikipedia articles, and run.\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program. For more information, visit [scds.ca/certificate-program](http://scds.ca/certificate-program). It is also eligible for the Canadian Certificate for Digital Humanities.
