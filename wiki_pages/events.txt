    "description": "This hands-on workshop teaches you to read and write R scripts for computation, data manipulation, and analysis. Using a web-based platform, you'll gain practical coding experience without needing to install any software.\n\n**What You'll Learn:** Our goal is to explain R syntax in clear, general terms so you can confidently work with R. Through concise exercises and real code examples, you'll build a solid foundation for using R in your academic work.\n\n**Who Should Attend:** This workshop is designed for students and scholars who want to apply R to assignments, projects, or research. No prior programming experience is required.\n\n**Workshop Structure:** The workshop includes six modules delivered across four sessions.  Each session runs from 4 pm until 5:15 pm.\n\n- **Before Nov 10:** Complete modules 1-2 independently. Explore the material, attempt the quizzes, and prepare questions for our first meeting.\n- **Nov 10 4:00-5:15pm (Session 1):** Discussion of modules 1-2\n- **Nov 11:** Unfortunately, our booking system cannot easily exclude this day from the registration - no session due to Remembrance Day.\n- **Nov 12 4:00-5:15pm (Session 2):** Work through modules 3-4\n- **Nov 13 4:00-5:15pm (Session 3):** Work through modules 5-6\n- **Nov 14 4:00-5:15pm (Final Session):** This session will walk through a larger project - creating an online academic portfolio by building and publishing a website using R, Quarto, and GitHub (all free tools)\n\nCome prepared with questions, challenges, and comments. This is a collaborative learning environment where your engagement drives the discussion",

The scheduling software is what researchers use to access the vast and diverse compute nodes made available by [DRAC](https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=112&amp;displayformat=dictionary). The scheduling software is also responsible for how fairness of the access to resources is achieved on these clusters that are freely available to all academic researchers in Canada. This course introduces the role of the scheduler on compute clusters before covering topics on its use. Beyond the general content of using a Slurm scheduler this course covers topics that are specific to the [DRAC](https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=112&amp;displayformat=dictionary) scheduling environment configuration and offers strategies for getting the most out of the national clusters.\n\nLive online classes will take place on **Fri. Nov. 14**, **Tues. Nov. 18**, and **Fri. Nov. 21** from **1 P.M. to 2 P.M.** Eastern Time.
