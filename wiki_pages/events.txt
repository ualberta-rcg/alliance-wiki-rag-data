    "description": "This hands-on workshop teaches you to read and write R scripts for computation, data manipulation, and analysis. Using a web-based platform, you'll gain practical coding experience without needing to install any software.\n\n**What You'll Learn:** Our goal is to explain R syntax in clear, general terms so you can confidently work with R. Through concise exercises and real code examples, you'll build a solid foundation for using R in your academic work.\n\n**Who Should Attend:** This workshop is designed for students and scholars who want to apply R to assignments, projects, or research. No prior programming experience is required.\n\n**Workshop Structure:** The workshop includes six modules delivered across four sessions.  Each session runs from 4 pm until 5:15 pm.\n\n- **Before Nov 10:** Complete modules 1-2 independently. Explore the material, attempt the quizzes, and prepare questions for our first meeting.\n- **Nov 10 4:00-5:15pm (Session 1):** Discussion of modules 1-2\n- **Nov 11:** Unfortunately, our booking system cannot easily exclude this day from the registration - no session due to Remembrance Day.\n- **Nov 12 4:00-5:15pm (Session 2):** Work through modules 3-4\n- **Nov 13 4:00-5:15pm (Session 3):** Work through modules 5-6\n- **Nov 14 4:00-5:15pm (Final Session):** This session will walk through a larger project - creating an online academic portfolio by building and publishing a website using R, Quarto, and GitHub (all free tools)\n\nCome prepared with questions, challenges, and comments. This is a collaborative learning environment where your engagement drives the discussion",

The scheduling software is what researchers use to access the vast and diverse compute nodes made available by [DRAC](https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=112&amp;displayformat=dictionary). The scheduling software is also responsible for how fairness of the access to resources is achieved on these clusters that are freely available to all academic researchers in Canada. This course introduces the role of the scheduler on compute clusters before covering topics on its use. Beyond the general content of using a Slurm scheduler this course covers topics that are specific to the [DRAC](https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=112&amp;displayformat=dictionary) scheduling environment configuration and offers strategies for getting the most out of the national clusters.\n\nLive online classes will take place on **Fri.

    "description": "Interested in digital mapping, but unsure of where to start? This beginner-focused workshop introduces you to the fundamentals of geographic data and teaches you how to create digital maps using QGIS, a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS). QGIS is available free of charge to everyone, including current students, staff, and faculty at McMaster University. It’s a great starting point for anyone looking to explore mapping in their research, projects, or creative work.\n\nBy the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:\n\n- Describe what geographic data is and explain the basic functions of geographic information systems (GIS)\n- Identify and navigate the main components of the QGIS graphical user interface.\n- Access and use geospatial web services within QGIS.\n- Understand the purpose of coordinate reference systems and apply them in QGIS.\n- Create a basic map layout using the QGIS print layout tool.\n\nAbsolutely no geography or quantitative background is necessary for an engaging experience. This session is great for beginners who are curious about mapping and want to explore how geographic data can be used to create digital maps with QGIS.\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/dash25-26/intro-qgis-1.html). This workshop will not be recorded.\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** Saman’s (she/her) work operates at the intersection of information science and critical geography. She’s particularly interested in the ways in which community-owned and -governed infrastructure can contribute to equitable knowledge systems. Currently, Saman takes care of McMaster’s Lloyd Reeds Map Collection, ensuring community members are able to access, understand, and use the collection for teaching and research.\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program. For more information, visit [scds.ca/certificate-program](http://scds.ca/certificate-program). \n\n**Credit Eligibility: **This workshop counts toward credit for students in the Faculty of Science who are enrolled in SCIENCE 2SF1: Digital Skills Workshop.

In the first talk of the series ([https://youtu.be/YPQUIkSIFhw](https://youtu.be/YPQUIkSIFhw)), we covered Xeus-Cling ([https://github.com/arminms/xeus-cling-jupyter](https://github.com/arminms/xeus-cling-jupyter)) and G3P ([https://github.com/arminms/g3p](https://github.com/arminms/g3p)). In the second part, after some updates about xeus-cling-jupyter (e.g. support for C++20), we learn how to use a parallel random number library like Ranx ([https://github.com/arminms/ranx](https://github.com/arminms/ranx)), together with STL's algorithms and distributions, for generating random numbers. The whole series is available as an executable book ([https://executablebooks.org](https://executablebooks.org)) at [https://arminms.github.io/high-performance-data-science-with-modern-cpp](https://arminms.github.io/high-performance-data-science-with-modern-cpp) .  \n---  \n  \nZoom account is required.
