    "description": "A thought-provoking exploration of the implications of data scraping in a world changed by AI. What is \"public data\" anyway? This session delves into the concept of \"Public Data\" as seen under both the academic research and general lens. We'll discuss the impacts of accessing and collecting data as well as the knock-on effects of using machine learning models trained with it. Factors such as privacy, cybersecurity, copyright, legislation, acceptable use, and applicable organizational policy all factor into this complex topic. In a time when many are looking for simple answers, the situation is anything but simple. While some desire to collect data, others are seeking ways to prevent their data from being scraped in the first place, or at least get their lawyers involved after the fact.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is facilitated by Scott Baker. Scott manages the Research Cybersecurity and Compliance team at UBC Advanced Research Computing: a group focused on supporting researchers to find secure solutions for their project architectures and research data as well as navigating compliance requirements. He is a member of the program leadership committee for UBC's Privacy &amp; Information Security Management program. He is also a member of the Digital Research Alliance of Canada national security council where he chairs the governance and policy working group.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_ROvjJmryTveg-84Hik76Ww)",

While the web interface is intuitive and remains our primary recommendation for most users, the command-line interface (CLI) offers advanced capabilities for automation, scripting, and managing large-scale workflows. In this webinar, we will present the globus-cli tool, show how to authenticate and configure your environment, and demonstrate key commands for transferring, monitoring, and managing files between endpoints. You will also learn tips for integrating globus-cli into scripts for repeatable and efficient data movement.",

It is high level enough that learning it is easy, and coding with it is significantly faster than other programming languages. However, the performance of pure Python programs is often sub-optimal, and might hinder your research. In this course, we will show you some ways to identify performance bottlenecks, improve slow blocks of code, and extend Python with compiled code. You'll learn about various ways to optimise and parallelise Python programs, particularly in the context of scientific and [high performance computing](https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=96&amp;displayformat=dictionary).\n\n  \n  \n\n**Prerequisite knowledge:** Know what classes and functions are; familiarity with Jupyter Notebook; basic console use; and comfortable with Python software carpentry material.\n\nLive online classes will take place on **Tues. Oct. 14, Fri. Oct. 17, Tues. Oct. 21,** and **Fri. Oct. 24** from **1 P.M. to 2 P.M.** Eastern Time.

This led to a scramble as various individuals and groups mobilized to save as much disappearing data as they could. These events served as a wake-up call and led to the founding of the Canadian Public Data Rescue Initiative (CPDRI). \r\n\r\nInitially formed, in part, to support rescue efforts in the U.S., the CPDRI also set out to build infrastructure to support public data in Canada. Drawing on projects including the Canadian Government Information Digital Preservation Network and the OCUL Ontario Data Rescue Group, the CPDRI is working to establish a sustainable strategy for preservation of vital Canadian public datasets. ",

    "description": "This workshop will introduce the Unix shell, a powerful way to communicate with your computer more directly through a command line interface. There are many ways to interact with a computer. Most of the time we click on things and select options with a cursor through a graphical user interface (GUI). A command line is exactly what it sounds like, a way of writing commands to your computer line by line and is incredibly powerful. In this workshop we will show you how to navigate through different parts of your system and introduce some of the most useful commands to be aware of.\n\nNo previous experience with the command line is required. This workshop is for beginners.\n\n**Pre-workshop setup**\n\nPlease have a laptop ready for this workshop. We will be using the Unix shell for most of the workshop. If you have a Mac or a Linux laptop you don't need to install or enable anything. If you are using a Windows10 PC you will need to turn on the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” setting as per [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36465000). \n\nThis workshop is part of the [Core Skills](https://libcal.library.ubc.ca/calendar/vancouver/?t=g&amp;q=Core%20Skills&amp;cid=7544&amp;cal=7544&amp;inc=0)series. \n\n## Location Details\n\n\tLocation:\n\t*ONLINE*\n\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or accessibility needs please email **digital.scholarship@ubc.ca.**\n\nTo keep up-to-date with all of the workshops, consults, and events, [subscribe to the UBC Library Research Commons monthly newsletter](https://bit.ly/UBCRCNewsSubscribeEnvoke).\n\nThis event is online.
