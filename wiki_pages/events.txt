This webinar examines practical strategies for consolidating large numbers of short tasks, including job arrays, task bundling techniques, and wrapper-based aggregation. We will discuss how these approaches differ in overhead, portability, scheduler behavior, and job failure handling. The session will also provide guidance on recognizing when packaging options no longer yield sufficient throughput and when transitioning to a serial farming model becomes advantageous. Serial farms can mitigate scheduler pressure, improve wait times on busy clusters, and offer more predictable performance. Examples will be provided throughout the Webinar and shared on GitHub for future reference.   \n---  \n  \nZoom account is required. Webinar registration is required. **VERY IMPORTANT:** During registration, you **have to provide the email address which is associated with your Zoom account**, otherwise you won't be able to register and/or attend the webinar!  Need help attending a webinar?

However, its performance often lags behind traditional compiled languages like C, C++, and Fortran, as well as newer contenders like Julia and Chapel. This course is designed to help you speed up your Python workflows using a variety of tools and techniques.  \nWe’ll begin with classic optimization methods such as NumPy-based vectorization, and explore just-in-time compilation using Numba, along with performance profiling techniques. From there, we’ll delve into parallelization – starting with multithreading using external libraries like NumExpr and Python 3.13’s new free-threading capabilities – but placing greater emphasis on multiprocessing.  \nNext, we’ll dive into Ray, a powerful and flexible framework for scaling Python applications. While Ray is widely used in AI, our focus will be on its core capabilities for distributed computing and data processing. You’ll learn how to parallelize CPU-bound numerical workflows – with and without reduction – as well as optimize I/O-bound tasks. We’ll also explore combining Ray with Numba and will discuss coding tightly coupled parallel problems.",
