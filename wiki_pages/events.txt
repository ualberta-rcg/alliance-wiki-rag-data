    "description": "Want to create maps but don’t have the time, patience, or storage space for a new application? We’ve got you covered. This beginner-friendly workshop is designed to show participants how to use familiar tools like Google Maps and Microsoft Excel, to make simple maps for reports, presentations, or even a group chat.\n\nIn this workshop, participants will:\n\n- Learn the basics of using Google Maps and Microsoft Excel to create and visualize spatial data\n- Become familiar with spatial data\n- Learn how to export maps for use in presentations, documents, and websites\n- Understand common mistakes in map making.\n\nNo technical expertise is required! This session is geared toward anyone looking to learn more about digital mapping tools and techniques.\n\n**Details:** Participants will require a Google Account and access to Microsoft Excel to follow along and make their own maps. Please note that you will need to download Microsoft Excel. The web version does not support the required mapping features. McMaster affiliates can [download Microsoft Excel here](https://learn.scds.ca/dash25-26/[url](https://office365.mcmaster.ca/office-365-3/applications/ms-excel/#tab-content-getting-started)). See all preparatory work for the session on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/dash25-26/user-friendly-maps.html). This workshop will not be recorded.\n\n**Facilitator Bios:**\n\n**Christine Homuth (she/her)** is the Library's GIS Specialist, providing support and resources to students, researchers, and faculty members working with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial data.\n\n**Saman’s (she/her)** work operates at the intersection of information science and critical geography. She’s particularly interested in the ways in which community-owned and -governed infrastructure can contribute to equitable knowledge systems. Currently, Saman takes care of McMaster’s Lloyd Reeds Map Collection, ensuring community members are able to access, understand, and use the collection for teaching and research.\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program. For more information, visit [scds.ca/certificate-program](http://scds.ca/certificate-program). \n\n**Credit Eligibility: **This workshop counts toward credit for students in the Faculty of Science who are enrolled in SCIENCE 2SF1: Digital Skills Workshop.

Specifically, all the terms such as: thread, process, job, vector processor, core, CUDA, MPI and many more. This session will provide you with a map to understand parallel computing, a description of the terms and concepts and how they relate to each other. Like any good map, it will let you know which concepts and terms you need to know in greater detail, and how they relate to what you are trying to do. With this map in hand, you will be in a better position to decide when and how to take advantage of the parallel computing architectures that are available to you. This workshop will include a simple and practical live demonstration running and viewing different types of parallel programs/concepts on an HPC cluster.\n\nTo find other courses in this series, please visit:\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/research-computing/bootcamps.html",

Join us for our first roundtable of the season **September 25 from 11 AM - 12 PM** **on Research and Lab Notebooks**.\n\nNotebooks are important records of decision-making, results, and processes during research. Although many researchers still use paper notebooks, electronic tools protect against data loss, enhance searching, and validate findings through permissions and signatures. While McMaster University does not offer dedicated software, we'll hear from researchers across disciplines about how they're making it work with available tools. We'll talk configuring workflows, setting up version control, which tools you avoid, onboarding students and new researchers, and other practical details.\n\nAround the table this month:\n\n- [Dr. Sara Andres](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/andressn) (Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences) introduces how she's configured **OneNote**\n- [Dr. Andrew McArthur](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/mcarthua) (Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences) shares his **GitLab **setup\n- [Akacia Propst](https://anthropology.mcmaster.ca/people/) (The/La Collaborative - Philosophy) discusses a **Research Documentation** template\n- [Dr. Andy Roddick](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/roddick) (Anthropology) outlines using **Obsidian** to build connections in a mass of information\n\n[Here is the meeting link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a1c5cab600046442e9ca22dbf61906391%40thread.tacv2/1755540378817?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2244376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22929fd809-7cb8-438c-93bc-f6bff66ea33a%22%7d).
