This workshop is your invitation to level up your data literacy, no matter your starting point or what you consider (or don’t consider) data. We’ll demystify key concepts like what even is data, what to do with it and how to begin interpreting it. This workshop will also show you how to ask better questions, spot red flags and make informed decisions. Think of it as a makeover for your brain—sparkly new skills included.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:  \n•    Understand foundational data concepts and terminology  \n•    Become more familiar with data in non-traditional forms  \n•    Learn how to begin critically evaluating data and spot red flags\n\nThis is an online event, please register to receive the event link. This workshop will be recorded, and the recording and workshops will be available online and sent to all registrants after the workshop. If you have accommodation requests or questions, reach out to [libevents@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:libevents@uwaterloo.ca) with your needs.   \n\n_Please note:_ This is the second of a four-part workshop series related to data and research data management.

    "description": "Topic: \"**What exactly is a Resource Allocation Competition (RAC) Compute Award?**\"  \nSpeaker: James Desjardins, SHARCNET  \n[Registration link](https://sharcnet-ca.zoom.us/meeting/register/Y-NeQIABTiODRvSf3c_dvA)  \n  \n---   \nThe Resource Allocation Competition (RAC) gives researchers the opportunity to request and be awarded quantities of storage, cloud and/or compute resources. In the case of storage and cloud, the resources awarded can be directly translated into what is made available to the researcher on the cluster (e.g. a 100TB storage allocation translates directly into a 100TB quota on a file system). For CPU or GPU compute awards, however, the translation of CPU or GPU years awarded to what is made available to the researcher is not as direct of a translation. Rather, a RAC compute allocation is implemented as a target share of the compute resources on a cluster for an account. The target share is a key factor in determining the priority of the account’s jobs in the queue based on the recent usage achieved by the account. This presentation describes how compute allocations are implemented on the clusters, covering topics like the relationship between Rapid Access Services (RAS) compute shares and RAC allocations, expected vs unexpected wait times, and monitoring the progress of using a compute allocation.   \n---  \n  \nZoom account is required. Webinar registration is required. **VERY IMPORTANT:** During registration, you **have to provide the email address which is associated with your Zoom account**, otherwise you won't be able to register and/or attend the webinar!  Need help attending a webinar?

    "description": "Cybersecurity awareness training is often seen as a passive exercise—slide decks, compliance checklists, and theoretical discussions. Improving our cybersecurity competency and resilience should also involve practical, hands-on experiences that mirror real-world threats. Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions offer a dynamic, gamified approach to cybersecurity education, where participants actively solve challenges based on real attack techniques and defence strategies.\r\n\r\nThis webinar explores how McMaster University is using CTF events as a means to break down traditional training barriers by providing an inclusive environment accessible to a wide range of skill levels—from beginners exploring cybersecurity for the first time to seasoned professionals refining their expertise. By engaging participants from diverse roles, including IT staff, research support staff, students, and faculty, CTFs foster collaboration and networking, reflecting the multidisciplinary effort required to defend against modern cyber threats.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn how CTFs provide unique, scenario-based perspectives on vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and defensive tactics, and how these experiences can enhance both individual problem-based learning skills and organizational security culture.\r\n\r\nThis session is hosted by Greg Atkinson, Jessica Blackwood, and Tim Philip. Jessica and Greg are full-time information technology professionals at McMaster University. Jessica works in the Faculty of Science, and Greg works for central IT. Their offices and teams support activities like risk management, teaching, administration, and research. Tim is a McMaster student who served a co-op term with the McMaster Information Security team, and the Research and High-Performance Computing team. During his co-op, Tim worked with Jessica, Greg, and other colleagues to introduce a new type of gamified cyber security education.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5yk8V39WT8S4wDkFzCdVfw)",
