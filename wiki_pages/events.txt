    "description": "Les systèmes nationaux utilisent un planificateur de tâches appelé « Slurm ». Au cours de cette session, vous apprendrez comment fonctionne Slurm et comment il attribue les tâches, ce qui vous aidera à : réduire le temps d'attente en formulant des demandes raisonnables ; ne demander que les ressources dont vous avez besoin, afin d'améliorer l'efficacité ; augmenter le débit ; exécuter davantage de tâches simultanément ; et dépanner et résoudre les pannes.\n\nCet atelier est destiné soit aux nouveaux utilisateurs HPC familiarisés avec Linux et les scripts Shell, mais qui n'ont pas encore utilisé Slurm, soit aux utilisateurs expérimentés qui passent à Slurm ou qui cherchent à améliorer leur efficacité avec le planificateur.",

Now what? How do you figure out what resources your jobs need on the cluster? What do you do when things go wrong? This workshop will share secrets of interactive cluster usage so you can schedule work efficiently, learn how to fix problems when things go wrong and use the system for interactive code development. High performance computing (HPC) clusters are composed of Linux machines, understanding and controlling work on a cluster is an extension of the skills in doing the same on a Linux machine. You will learn how to debug by telling how many resources: memory, open files, how much disk IO, Iops and how much network traffic a program uses.\n\nTo find other courses in this series, please visit:\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/research-computing/bootcamps.html",

    "description": "Surveys remain one of the most widely used tools for studying how people think and act. This session examines their strengths and limitations in understanding political attitudes and behaviours, particularly in contexts of high political polarization. We will consider the practical and methodological difficulties of online survey research, including recruitment, response bias, data quality, and tracking attitudes over time. Drawing on evidence from Viewpoint Alberta, a large, multi-year survey project examining the political attitudes and behaviours of Albertans, we will discuss lessons for designing surveys that balance rigour with feasibility in contemporary political research.\r\n\r\nThis talk will double as both the first webinar in the HSS Spotlight series, sponsored by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada, and as the launch seminar of the Transforming Research for Social Impact hub (https://www.ualberta.ca/en/social-sciences-humanities/initiatives/transforming-research-for-social-impact-hub/index.html) at the University of Alberta. The TRSI Hub is the first pan-university initiative in Alberta focused on developing innovative methodologies that promote community-driven social change and address complex social issues. The Hub responds to a rapidly changing world of social research by offering comprehensive social research methods training and advancement targeted toward social impact.\r\n\r\nSpeakers:\r\nDr. Feo Snagovsky is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Alberta. His research focuses on the comparative analysis of elections and political behaviour – particularly in the role that political elites play in shaping identity and public opinion. His work has been published in Party Politics, Parliamentary Affairs, Government and Opposition, Electoral Studies, the Canadian Journal of Political Science and the Australian Journal of Political Science. His current research examines conspiracy theory belief and support for democracy.\r\n\r\nEvan Walker is a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Alberta. Having completed his Master's studies at the U of A, Evan’s research interests centre around populism, political behaviour, and occasionally political economy. Evan aims to mesh his background in Political Science, Economics, and Geography to help better understand public opinion.",
