    "description": "With headlines like \"The Quantum Threat to Encryption\" and \"Quantum Computers Just Broke RSA Encryption\" one might get the impression that immediate change is urgently needed. Instead of such sensationalism, we will explore the topic from a more realistic footing. Starting with some background about how most current cryptography is based, how quantum computers and qubits work, and how future quantum computers could defeat it. Then, we move on to look at the current realities of state-of-the-art quantum computing, including discussing some of the sensational claims. Finally, we will look at what can and should actually be done in this space, including the real risks and how they stack up against other cybersecurity risks in the current environment.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is facilitated by Scott Baker and Jacob Boschee. Scott manages the Research Cybersecurity and Compliance team at UBC Advanced Research Computing: a group focused on supporting researchers to find secure solutions for their project architectures and research data as well as navigating compliance requirements. He is a member of the program leadership committee for UBC's Privacy &amp; Information Security Management program. He is also a member of the Digital Research Alliance of Canada national security council where he chairs the governance and policy working group.\r\n\r\nJacob Boschee is the Senior Systems Analyst for the Research Innovations, Solutions and Engagement team at UBC Advanced Research Computing. He oversees new service offerings for researchers and assists with software deployment covering a wide variety of research fields. His own research background is in physics and quantum computing where he first developed his skillset in research computing.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_MEEkDV4FRD-W-9TVFpWesg)",

    "description": "Looking for an accessible way to analyze data? SPSS is a widely used statistical software that makes it easy to explore, summarize, and interpret data—no programming required.\n\nThis beginner-friendly workshop introduces SPSS through hands-on activities using its point-and-click interface. You’ll learn how to import data, run basic descriptive statistics, and perform simple analyses like t-tests and correlations.\n\nBy the end of this session, participants will be able to:\n\n- Navigate the SPSS interface and load data\n- Run descriptive statistics such as means, frequencies, and standard deviations\n- Conduct basic statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, correlations)\n- Interpret and export results from SPSS\n\nThis session is ideal for students, researchers, and staff who want a user-friendly introduction to statistical analysis. No prior experience required!\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/dash25-26/intro-spss.html). This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared on the same page, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre's [Online Learning Catalogue.](https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/)\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** \n\n**Vivek Jadon** (he/him) provides research support in the use of numeric research data. As part of his role, Vivek is McMaster University’s official representative for Statistics Canada’s Data Liberation Initiative (DLI) program and Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). Both of these programs provide researchers with vast archive of research data from various disciplines for high quality research and instruction. Vivek is also involved in building awareness and promoting RDM activities/services at McMaster.\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program. For more information, visit [scds.ca/certificate-program](http://scds.ca/certificate-program).\n\n**Credit Eligibility: **This workshop counts toward credit for students in the Faculty of Science who are enrolled in SCIENCE 2SF1: Digital Skills Workshop.
