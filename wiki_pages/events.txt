The goal of this course is to prepare graduate students for performing scientific data analysis. Successful students will learn how to use statistical inference tools to gain insight into large and small data sets, as well as be exposed to cutting-edge techniques and best practises to store, manage and analyze (large) data.  Topics include: Python and R programming, version control, automation, modular programming and scientific visualization.\n\t\n\tThere are three ways to follow this course:\n\t\n\t    As a graduate course for UofT PhD and MSc students. Students that wish to do so, should not self-enrol here, but enrol using ACORN/ROSI.\n\t    As a SciNet or Alliance user taking the course for SciNet certificate credits; for that, enrol on this site (note: limited spots).\n\t    As an auditor following along with recordings but not submitting assignments; for this no enrollment is needed.",

    "description": "The Winter Visualization Series is a multi-week lineup of hands-on workshops designed to introduce participants to modern scientific and data-driven visualization tools and techniques. Spanning both foundational skills and advanced workflows, the series highlights a broad ecosystem of tools used across research, education, and industry.\r\n\r\nParticipants will explore core Python plotting libraries -- including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Vega-Altair -- as well as the principles behind the grammar of graphics in both R and Python. Several sessions focus on ParaView, covering essential usage, scripting, animation, remote visualization strategies for large-scale data, and in-situ workflows using Catalyst2. Additional workshops introduce visualization in domain-specific tools such as VMD for molecular graphics and Gephi for network visualization, and modern web-based frameworks like vtk.js and trame.\r\n\r\nYou are encouraged to bring your own datasets to these workshops.\r\n\r\n➡️ Register [here](https://forms.gle/XyjAMRDAM4A3DCr7A) (registration is required to receive the Zoom link)\r\n🗓️ To add individual workshops to your calendar, visit [this page](http://folio.vastcloud.org/winterseries)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nL’école hivernale de visualisation vous propose de nombreux ateliers pratiques conçus pour vous initier aux outils et aux techniques modernes de visualisation scientifique et de données.

    "description": "Interested in digital mapping, but unsure of where to start? This beginner-focused workshop introduces you to the fundamentals of geographic data and teaches you how to create digital maps using QGIS, a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS). QGIS is available free of charge to everyone, including current students, staff, and faculty at McMaster University. It’s a great starting point for anyone looking to explore mapping in their research, projects, or creative work.\n\nBy the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:\n\n- Describe what geographic data is and explain the basic functions of geographic information systems (GIS).\n- Identify and navigate the main components of the QGIS graphical user interface.\n- Access and use geospatial web services within QGIS.\n- Understand the purpose of coordinate reference systems and apply them in QGIS.\n- Create a basic map layout using the QGIS print layout tool.\n\nAbsolutely no geography or quantitative background is necessary for an engaging experience. This session is great for beginners who are curious about mapping and want to explore how geographic data can be used to create digital maps with QGIS.\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/dash25-26/intro-qgis-2.html). This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared on the same page, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre's [Online Learning Catalogue.](https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/)\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** Saman’s (she/her) work operates at the intersection of information science and critical geography. She’s particularly interested in the ways in which community-owned and -governed infrastructure can contribute to equitable knowledge systems. Currently, Saman takes care of McMaster’s Lloyd Reeds Map Collection, ensuring community members are able to access, understand, and use the collection for teaching and research.\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program. For more information, visit [scds.ca/certificate-program](http://scds.ca/certificate-program). \n\n**Credit Eligibility: **This workshop counts toward credit for students in the Faculty of Science who are enrolled in SCIENCE 2SF1: Digital Skills Workshop.

It is a free and open source software library that offers fine-grained control over every aspect of a plot, making it a powerful tool for customizing figures to meet specific needs. In this workshop, we will use a Jupyter notebook to show you how to create common 2D plot types such as line, scatter, and heatmaps, and how to customize the labels, legend, and panel layout. We will briefly touch on using Matplotlib to produce animations and interactive visualizations. By the end of this one-hours session, you will have a basic understanding of the library's capabilities.",
