In this workshop, we’ll reframe the often-tedious process of cleaning data as an act of care: for your project, your collaborators and yourself. You’ll learn how to spot and fix common issues, streamline messy data sets, and create workflows that feel less like punishment and more like progress. Come for the skills, stay for the emotional catharsis.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:  \n•    Identify and address common data quality issues  \n•    Apply techniques for efficient and effective data cleaning  \n•    Build workflows that support both technical accuracy and emotional resilience\n\nThis is an online event, please register to receive the event link. This workshop will be recorded, and the recording and workshops will be available online and sent to all registrants after the workshop. If you have accommodation requests or questions, reach out to [libevents@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:libevents@uwaterloo.ca) with your needs.   \n\n_Please note:_ This is the final workshop of a four-part workshop series related to data and research data management. You do not need to attend all four; please register for each workshop separately.   \n ",

This modern OOD system replaces the standalone VDI desktop system that serviced users on the old Graham cluster for several years. Just as the old VDI system had access to all user files on Graham, the new OOD system will likely see all user files on Nibi. Beyond this point, the similarities in usage of the two systems very nearly completely diverge. The purpose of this presentation is to demonstrate how several of the common engineering packages, that the Alliance provides modules for under CVMFS, can be utilized on this new OOD system to unlock its full potential for running graphics front ends or interactive compute or debugging tasks on cluster nodes.   \n---  \n  \nZoom account is required. Webinar registration is required. **VERY IMPORTANT:** During registration, you **have to provide the email address which is associated with your Zoom account**, otherwise you won't be able to register and/or attend the webinar!  Need help attending a webinar?

    "description": "This set of five workshops is an introduction to Python programming, with a focus on skills that are relevant to students and researchers who are working with data, particularly tabular data.\n\nThe five workshops have the following goals:\n\n- To understand the basics of Python syntax, variables, and data types.\n- To learn how to work with tabular data in Python, including reading, manipulating, and visualizing data.\n- To learn how to automate tasks in Python, including working with multiple files.\n- To learn to use logic and modularity to make Python code flexible and reusable.\n- To develop good habits for programming for research in Python, including handling errors, debugging, and writing reliable code.\n\nParticipants must sign up for each workshop individually. It is not necessary to sign up for the first workshop in order to do the second (and so on), but note that each workshop will build on the topics covered in previous workshops in this series.\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\nThere are no prerequisites needed for this series; no prior programming experience is required.\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n\nIn these workshops, we will write Python code in a text editor called Visual Studio Code (VS Code).\n\nPlease follow the following steps/links to complete the setup for this workshop series before you attend:\n\n1. Install a [Python Interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter)\n2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n3. Install the [Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). If you want more info on installing extensions for VS Code, [see this page on their “Extension Marketplace”](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace)\n4. Install this [Python Debugger extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy)\n\n**NOTE:** You may use your own preferred text editor or Jupyter Notebooks to write code in these workshops, but keep in mind that some aspects may be unpredictably different from the way things appear on the instructor's screen. For example, the instructor will frequently use the Python Debugger in VS Code, and other text editors may have entirely different mechanisms for debugging, and you may have to figure that out on your own. If you want to follow what the instructor is doing exactly, you should install VS Code and the extensions listed above.\n\n### Location details:\n\n\tLocation:\n\t*IN-PERSON and ONLINE* (synchronous)\n\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, or accessibility needs, please email **[digital.scholarship@ubc.ca](mailto:digital.scholarship@ubc.ca).**\n\nTo keep up-to-date with all our workshops, consults, and events, [subscribe to the UBC Library Research Commons monthly newsletter](https://bit.ly/UBCRCNewsSubscribeEnvoke).\n\nThis event is in-person and online (synchronous). Registrants receive the online link 3 hours before the event. Registration closes at that time.",
