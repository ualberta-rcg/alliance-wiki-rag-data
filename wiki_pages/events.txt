    "description": "Canada’s agri-food sector—central to national security, economic stability, and public health—is becoming a high-value target for cyber attackers. From ransomware locking robotic milking systems to attacks that have resulted in livestock deaths, the threats facing agricultural operations are no longer hypothetical. This talk exposes the real and rising cyber risks in smart farming environments and explains why Canada's agri-food sector is now one of its most vulnerable critical infrastructures.\r\n\r\nDrawing on real-world case studies—including a ransomware attack on a Canadian dairy farm and an incident in Switzerland where system failure led to the death of a cow and its unborn calf—this session illustrates the devastating impact of cyber attacks on food production and animal welfare. The presentation highlights the evolving threat landscape, including opportunistic criminals, state-sponsored groups, and increasingly, hacktivists targeting farming operations for ideological reasons.\r\n\r\nAttendees will gain practical insights into key mitigation steps, including how to select the right cybersecurity experts, conduct self-assessments, and implement managed monitoring solutions. The session also discusses why many traditional tools (like antivirus software) are insufficient for protecting cyber-physical systems in ag-tech.\r\n\r\nThe talk concludes with an interactive tabletop exercise where participants will simulate a ransomware attack response at a dairy farm, experiencing firsthand the operational, ethical, and strategic challenges involved.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is a call to action for producers, policymakers, and technology vendors: protecting Canada’s food systems from cyber threats isn’t just IT’s job—it’s everyone’s responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is facilitated by Dr. Ali Dehghantanha. Dr. Dehghantanha is a leading academic-entrepreneur and thought leader in AI security. He is the co-founder and CEO of Avaly.AI, a company dedicated to building security for an AI-First world.\r\n\r\nAs a Canada Research Chair in Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence, Dr. Dehghantanha is also the founding director of the Canada Cyber Foundry at the University of Guelph, a center focused on advancing cybersecurity education, innovation, and industry collaboration.\r\n\r\nHe established and leads the Master of Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence program, as well as the Master of Leadership in Cybersecurity and Cyberpreneurship, equipping the next generation of cybersecurity professionals and innovators with the skills to navigate an AI-driven security landscape.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_66KDaayxTfGKAH3T9OiVVg)",

    "description": "[Register](https://forms.gle/EPagTRjeM2L27t857)  \n   \nAbstract: Project Jupyter was extremely innovative when, back in 2011, they built an open-source Notebook on top of the IPython shell (itself an improvement over the Python shell). Notebooks proved an extremely popular tool for literate programming and are widely used today.  \n  \nThey do however come with two major issues:  \n\n1. They are a nightmare for version control. The JSON-like format of the .ipynb files used by Jupyter makes versioning a challenge without the use of proprietary tools or hacky back and forth conversions with, for instance, jupytext.\n2. It is easy to forget to rerun cells in order and publish a non-reproducible notebook. A study of 10 million notebooks published on GitHub fond that 36% of them had been run in a non-linear fashion.\nMarimo is a new generation of open-source notebook for Python that addresses these problems by using a dataflow graph under the hood ensuring that cells remain up to date and using .py as its file format. Marimo notebooks also provide excellent interactivity with direct synchronization with the Python kernel. Consequently, these new notebooks have seen a surge in popularity since their launch in 2023.  \n  \nIn this webinar, I will demo the installation and usage of marimo notebooks.",

Modern GPUs (such as NVIDIA A100 and H100) are massively parallel and very expensive devices. Most of GPU jobs are incapable of utilizing these GPUs efficiently, either due to the problem size being too small to saturate the GPU, or due to the intermittent (bursty) GPU utilization pattern. This course will teach you how to measure the GPU utilization of your jobs on our clusters, and show how to use the two NVIDIA technologies - MPS (Multi-Process Service) and MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) - to improve GPU utilization.\n\nThis course is self-paced, but will also be given live on **Tues. Oct. 28,** and **Tues. Nov. 4** from **1 P.M. to 2 P.M.** Eastern Time.

    "description": "As research continues to generate and depend on vast volumes of data, the boundaries between healthcare, computation, and innovation continue to blur. High-performance computing, cloud environments, and federated data platforms are transforming how research is conducted, yet the frameworks that govern cybersecurity, privacy, and data management often struggle to keep pace with this digital acceleration.\r\n \r\nIn this session, Irfaan, Senior Information Risk Analyst at the SickKids Research Institute, introduces how cybersecurity and information risk management principles can strengthen trust, integrity, and collaboration across the research lifecycle. Drawing on experience at the intersection of clinical research, IT compliance, and information risk, he will outline how standards such as those from NIST and policy instruments like Canada’s Tri- Agency Research Data Management Policy influence how institutions think about protecting data, enabling collaboration, and supporting responsible research.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn that effective security in research is not only about firewalls and encryption, but also about building a culture of responsible innovation that safeguards data, protects patients, and sustains discovery across Ontario’s research ecosystem.",

    "description": "This presentation is based on a recently published paper - see https://ojs.library.carleton.ca/index.php/PPJ-CIPSER/article/view/4990.  The paper explores the application of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles to High Performance Computing Infrastructure (HPCI), which has become increasingly crucial for scientific, industrial, and AI workloads. Traditional cybersecurity frameworks like the ISO 27000-series and NIST 800-series have proven inadequate for the unique challenges posed by HPCI. \r\n\r\nThe paper is informed by three regulatory frameworks: OMB Memo M-22-09, CISA's Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM), and NIST Special Publication 800-223, which collectively shape the U.S. Federal Government's approach to ZTA in HPCI. The study assesses the compatibility of ZTMM with HPCI across five pillars, identifying potential challenges in balancing security, cost, complexity, and performance. The findings suggest that a \"Traditional\" maturity level is most suitable for HPCI, given its unique characteristics and operational demands.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is facilitated by Tyson Macaulay and Daksha Bhasker. Tyson is an active security researcher and lecturer at Carleton University specializing in Critical Infrastructure Protection. Tyson has a personal syllabus of four books, dozens of periodical publications, international standards contributions, several registered patents and continues to support the development of engineering and security standards through volunteer efforts in the International Standards Organization (ISO) and Professional Engineers of Ontario (PEO), and various Board positions. Tyson has worked extensively in the cyber security industry with networking, Data Centers, High Performance Computing (HPC) and blockchain technology. \r\n\r\nDaksha Bhasker (P.Eng, CISSP) is a Principal Security Architect at Navy Federal Credit Union. She has over 20 years of experience in the software and telecommunications service provider industry with multinationals as Microsoft, Comcast NBCUniversal and Bell Canada, working on complex carrier grade system security architectures. She is passionate about security of emerging technologies, engaging with the broader security industry to better the state of technical security architectures.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_jjbpdmwZT-atAw6aJHdxfQ)",
