    "description": "The Winter Visualization Series is a multi-week lineup of hands-on workshops designed to introduce participants to modern scientific and data-driven visualization tools and techniques. Spanning both foundational skills and advanced workflows, the series highlights a broad ecosystem of tools used across research, education, and industry.\r\n\r\nParticipants will explore core Python plotting libraries -- including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Vega-Altair -- as well as the principles behind the grammar of graphics in both R and Python. Several sessions focus on ParaView, covering essential usage, scripting, animation, remote visualization strategies for large-scale data, and in-situ workflows using Catalyst2. Additional workshops introduce visualization in domain-specific tools such as VMD for molecular graphics and Gephi for network visualization, and modern web-based frameworks like vtk.js and trame.\r\n\r\nYou are encouraged to bring your own datasets to these workshops.\r\n\r\n➡️ Register [here](https://forms.gle/XyjAMRDAM4A3DCr7A) (registration is required to receive the Zoom link)\r\n🗓️ To add individual workshops to your calendar, visit [this page](http://folio.vastcloud.org/winterseries)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nL’école hivernale de visualisation vous propose de nombreux ateliers pratiques conçus pour vous initier aux outils et aux techniques modernes de visualisation scientifique et de données. Couvrant à la fois les bases de la visualisation et les flux de travail plus avancés, cette école met en lumière un vaste écosystème d'outils utilisés dans la recherche, l'éducation et l'industrie.\r\n\r\nLes premiers ateliers exploreront les principales bibliothèques de visualisation en Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly et Vega-Altair) ainsi que les principes fondamentaux de la représentation graphique en R et en Python. Ensuite, plusieurs ateliers seront consacrés à ParaView : utilisation de base, programmation, animation, stratégies de visualisation à distance pour les données à grande échelle et flux de travail in situ avec Catalyst2. Enfin, d'autres ateliers présenteront la visualisation dans des outils spécialisés tels que VMD pour la visualisation moléculaire et Gephi pour la visualisation de réseaux, ainsi que des frameworks web modernes comme vtk.js et trame.\r\n\r\nNous vous encourageons à apporter vos propres données à ces ateliers.\r\n\r\n➡️ Inscrivez-vous [ici](https://forms.gle/XyjAMRDAM4A3DCr7A) (l’inscription est requise pour obtenir un lien Zoom)\r\n🗓️ Pour ajouter individuellement des ateliers à votre calendrier, visitez [cette page](https://folio.vastcloud.org/ecolehivernale)\r\n\r\n• [Jan-20, 10am PT] [Intro session: which tool is right for me? ](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/intro-session-which-tool-is-right-for-me-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Jan-20, 11am PT] [Plotting in Python with Matplotlib](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/plotting-in-python-with-matplotlib-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Jan-27, 10am PT] [Plotting in Python with Seaborn](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/plotting-in-python-with-seaborn-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Jan-30, 10am PT] [Plotting in Python with Plotly](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/plotting-in-python-with-plotly-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-03, 10am PT] [Plotting in Python with Vega-Altair](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/plotting-in-python-with-vega-altair-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-06, 10am PT] [Basic ParaView](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/basic-paraview-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-10, 10am PT] [The grammar of graphics in R and Python](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/the-grammar-of-graphics-in-r-and-python-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-13, 10am PT] [ Introduction à ParaView - en français](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/basic-paraview-in-french-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-24, 10am PT] [ParaView scripting](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/paraview-scripting-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Feb-27, 10am PT] [ Scripter des visualisations via ParaView - en français](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/paraview-scripting-in-french-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-03, 10am PT] [ParaView animation](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/paraview-animation-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-06, 10am PT] [ Visualisations animées avec ParaView - en français](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/paraview-animation-in-french-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-10, 10am PT] [Remote and large-scale visualization in ParaView](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/remote-and-large-scale-visualization-in-paraview-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-13, 10am PT] [Introductory VMD](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/introductory-vmd-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-17, 10am PT] [Programmable Filter and Source in ParaView](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/programmable-filter-and-source-in-paraview-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-20, 10am PT] [Network visualization with Gephi](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/network-visualization-with-gephi-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-24, 10am PT] [In-situ visualization with Catalyst2](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/in-situ-visualization-with-catalyst2-winter-vis-series)\r\n• [Mar-27, 10am PT] [Modern tools for web visualization](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/events/modern-tools-for-web-visualization-winter-vis-series)",

    "description": "Librarians and research office staff are often the first point of contact for academic researchers with research-related questions of any kind, whether or not they’re experts in a particular area. Over the past five years, they’ve particularly become the go-to for questions around working with and managing research data, including questions around intensive data analysis, working with big data, cloud computing, and more. Many of these research approaches require the use of advanced research computing (ARC) infrastructure and techniques; however, ARC infrastructure and support aren’t available at all Canadian institutions, and librarians and research staff themselves may not know about them. This session will introduce librarians and research staff to fundamentals of ARC and of ARC infrastructure in Canada so that they can better support their researchers in getting the help they need.\r\n\r\nTopics will include:\r\n• Some basic principles of advanced research computing, and how it differs from everyday computing\r\n• The ARC services provided by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (including infrastructure and support)\r\n• How to tell if a researcher needs to use ARC services\r\n• Case studies of researchers using ARC\r\n\r\nLearning outcomes for session attendees:\r\n• Describe fundamental differences between advanced research computing and everyday computing\r\n• Identify what services the Alliance provides\r\n• Formulate questions to ask researchers to determine whether they have a need that Alliance services may meet\r\n• Connect researchers with resources to help them get started with ARC",

In this workshop, we will introduce ParaView's Python tools, starting with using the Trace feature to convert GUI actions into scripts and then showing how to simplify and modify those scripts. You will learn how to run them using pvpython and pvbatch, and how to explore VTK data from the ParaView Python shell.  \nPrerequisites: basic ParaView knowledge (importing and examining data, working with filters)",
