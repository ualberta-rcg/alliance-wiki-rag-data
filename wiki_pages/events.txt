    "description": "We live in an era of genomics. With sequencing costs dropping dramatically over the past decade, vast amounts of genomic data are now being generated across many fields. These include well known applications like ancestry testing (i.e.23andMe), predicting cancer risks, identifying COVID-19 variants, to more theoretical uses in evolutionary biology, molecular ecology, and beyond.\n\nDo you understand why one sequencing approach is chosen over another?\n\nThis introductory workshop is designed for participants from all backgrounds - no prior experience required. We’ll explore key types of sequencing data and how they are applied in biological research so you can better understand projects involving sequencing or design your own experiment. Topics will include:\n\n- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for identifying genes linked to traits or diseases\n- Genome assembly for detecting chromosomal structural variation\n- Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis for species detection in ecological studies\n- ...and more (tell us what you're curious about in a pre-workshop survey)\n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will have a basic understanding of:\n\n- Common sequencing approaches and their differences\n- The strengths and limitations of each method\n- How to choose an appropriate sequencing strategy for a given research question\n\n \n\nPre-workshop setup:\n\nPlease have a laptop or phone ready for this workshop.\n\n \n\nContact info:\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or accessibility needs, please email yue.yu@ubc.ca\n\n ",
