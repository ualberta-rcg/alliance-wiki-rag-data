    "description": "Whether you regularly engage with visual generative AI or are just dipping your toe into these waters, this workshop focuses on recognizing sources of image biases and its impacts and implications as artificial images become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous. Applying a combined historical and ethics lens, workshop participants will have the opportunity to generate and analyze artificial images as a means of unpacking continuity and changes in visual practices and norms. The workshop supports the development of critical reflection skills and tools for creating and ‘reading’ images that avoid potential pitfalls of (re)producing harmful clichés and to support identification of mis/disinformation. The workshop has relevance for academic integrity along with navigating our daily visual landscape, which in turn has implications for democracy, civic engagement, and human relationships. At a time when visual evidence/truth, dis/misinformation and academic integrity are at stake, there is no time like the present to gain a solid foundation on visual literacy.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:\n\n- Identify opportunities, pitfalls and potential harms of visual generative AI to make informed decisions on its use in educational and every-day life settings by exploring recent examples.\n- Unpack the role of audience engagement with visual images in the era of AI to critically analyse the impacts of and to support responsible use of this new technology.\n- Trace biases and ethically problematic visual stereotypes present in AI-generated images through comparison and critical reflection of historical cases\n\nThis workshop is great for students, educators, researchers, and professionals interested in developing critical visual literacy skills to responsibly engage with AI-generated images in academic, creative, or everyday contexts!\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/dmds25-26/ai-visions.html). This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared on the same page, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre's [Online Learning Catalogue.](https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/)\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** \n\nDr. Sonya de Laat is the Academic Program Advisor and Curriculum Coordinator in the School of Global Health and Social Medicine, and a Research Associate with the Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact at McMaster University. With degrees in Anthropology and Media Studies, Dr. de Laat’s work has focused on historical and ethical dimensions of humanitarian visual culture and action. Currently, her focus is on challenging the promises/hopes of photorealistic generative AI and sharing diverse visual histories as a corrective intervention. Her postdoctoral work focused on moral and practical dimensions of palliative care in refugee camps drawing attention to small interventions having big impacts, and the importance of co-design and partnered research. Dr. de Laat is an active member of the Humanitarian Health Ethics research group, and the Canadian Network on Humanitarian History.

Given that all supercomputers at Canada’s national data centres operate on Linux, proficiency in Linux is essential for researchers to fully leverage these computational resources. As a follow-up to the previous session [\"Leveraging the power of Linux on Windows with WSL\"](https://youtu.be/efHBV3b1Ylg), this talk delves into the advanced practices that unlock its full potential. we will focus more on efficient uses of WSL such as accessing Windows files from WSL and vice versa, developing and running applications on WSL, making and duplicating your own WSL distros, and lastly taking a snapshot of a WSL Linux distro to run elsewhere using Apptainer.  \n  \nThe targeted audience are Windows users who run their research applications on Canada's national clusters.   \n---  \n  \nZoom account is required.

    "description": "Finding security vulnerabilities in applications needs to scale in speed and accuracy as AI driven software development increases and introduces uncertainty in the quality of future software. The ability to customize security scanning to the context of applications is becoming increasingly important due to increasing software complexity. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will discuss some modern techniques used to analyze software and hardware to fix security issues before they may even manifest when vulnerable software runs. Attendees will journey from an overview of core information security principles to the development of custom security tools using open-source technologies. We will cover how static and dynamic analysis of software, networks and data becomes the core of modern open source and commercial information security tools. We will then review some common software flaws in web applications and discuss best practices when writing code so as to avoid these flaws. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate such security issues, we will take two real world examples - an XSS vulnerability in eBay (2017) and a vulnerability in a consumer-grade Dlink Router (2023). We will demonstrate how we can find such issues early using static analysis tools and frameworks like Joern [http://joern.io] \r\n\r\nOur goal is to help researchers and engineers look at the software they build and run on critical systems from a security lens - enabling them to rectify issues early and building a proactive security posture as they build the backbone of modern technological solutions in Canada. Adjacent to this, we also aim to show security practitioners some tools and techniques to build and scale their own sovereign software security tooling.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is facilitated by Suchakra Sharma. Suchakra is the Chief Scientific Officer at Whirly Labs, where he leads the Security and Privacy Research and Education team. He brings over 10 years of experience in the security and privacy industry, having worked with large enterprise clients and government organizations with a special focus on software analysis tools. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Polytechnique Montréal, where he worked on hardware-assisted tracing for operating systems analysis. He invented the first hardware trace-based virtual machine analysis technique using specialized instructions in Intel chipsets. He has delivered talks, trainings, and lectures on software analysis and cybersecurity at major venues such as RSA, Black Hat, Carnegie Mellon University, USENIX LISA, USENIX Enigma, CPDP, the UN Internet Governance Forum, and NorthSec. He is also a regular contributor to IEEE, serving as a reviewer for leading research journals and conferences.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5eJB5dZqR0Op3Hrl7gfnuQ)",
