    "description": "Cybersecurity awareness training is often seen as a passive exercise—slide decks, compliance checklists, and theoretical discussions. Improving our cybersecurity competency and resilience should also involve practical, hands-on experiences that mirror real-world threats. Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions offer a dynamic, gamified approach to cybersecurity education, where participants actively solve challenges based on real attack techniques and defence strategies.\r\n\r\nThis webinar explores how McMaster University is using CTF events as a means to break down traditional training barriers by providing an inclusive environment accessible to a wide range of skill levels—from beginners exploring cybersecurity for the first time to seasoned professionals refining their expertise. By engaging participants from diverse roles, including IT staff, research support staff, students, and faculty, CTFs foster collaboration and networking, reflecting the multidisciplinary effort required to defend against modern cyber threats.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn how CTFs provide unique, scenario-based perspectives on vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and defensive tactics, and how these experiences can enhance both individual problem-based learning skills and organizational security culture.\r\n\r\nThis session is hosted by Greg Atkinson, Jessica Blackwood, and Tim Philip. Jessica and Greg are full-time information technology professionals at McMaster University. Jessica works in the Faculty of Science, and Greg works for central IT. Their offices and teams support activities like risk management, teaching, administration, and research. Tim is a McMaster student who served a co-op term with the McMaster Information Security team, and the Research and High-Performance Computing team. During his co-op, Tim worked with Jessica, Greg, and other colleagues to introduce a new type of gamified cyber security education.\r\n\r\n[Register for the Zoom Session](https://engagedri-ca.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5yk8V39WT8S4wDkFzCdVfw)",

With ParaView, users can interactively visualize 2D and 3D data sets defined on structured, adaptive and unstructured meshes or particles, animate these datasets over time, and manipulate them with a variety of filters. ParaView supports both interactive visualization through a graphical user interface (GUI) and scripted visualization, including offscreen rendering, and is an easy and enjoyable tool to learn.",

    "description": "Want to explore how people, ideas, or objects are connected? In this virtual workshop, you will learn how to use Gephi, a free and open-source tool designed for network visualization and analysis. We will focus on how graph data can help express relationships between entities, perfect for exploring everything from social networks to historical connections.\n\nIn this workshop, participants will learn to:\n\n- Import a dataset into Gephi\n- Identify key network elements such as nodes and edges.\n- Apply basic layout algorithms (e.g., Force Atlas 2, Fruchterman Reingold)\n- Utilize visual ranking tools (e.g., node size by degree, edge color by weight) to effectively explore and visualize network structures within Gephi.\n\nThis session is ideal for anyone curious about visualizing networks—no prior experience with Gephi or network analysis is required! It’s especially useful for humanities scholars interested in exploring relationships in texts, people, or historical data.\n\n**Details:** Any preparatory work for the session can be found on its [information page](https://learn.scds.ca/dash25-26/gephi.html). This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared on the same page, and discoverable via the Sherman Centre's [Online Learning Catalogue.](https://scds.ca/searchable-online-learning/)\n\n**Facilitator Bio:** Subhanya (she/her) brings a background of research in data justice, science and technology studies, and environmental humanities. She is currently thinking through participatory data design which allow for visualizations that are empowering for the end user.\n\n**Certificate Eligibility:** This workshop is eligible for the Sherman Centre's certificate program. For more information, visit [scds.ca/certificate-program](http://scds.ca/certificate-program).\n\n**Credit Eligibility: **This workshop counts toward credit for students in the Faculty of Science who are enrolled in SCIENCE 2SF1: Digital Skills Workshop.
