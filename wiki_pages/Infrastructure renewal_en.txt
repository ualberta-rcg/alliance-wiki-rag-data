=Major upgrade of our Advanced Research Computing infrastructure=

Our Advanced Research Computing infrastructure is undergoing major changes starting in winter 2024-2025, most new systems are now expected to be available to users during summer 2025. These changes will improve High Performance Computing (HPC) and Cloud services for Canadian researchers. This page will be regularly updated to keep you informed of the activities concerning the transition to the new equipment.

The infrastructure renewal will replace the nearly 80% of our current equipment that is approaching end-of-life. The new equipment will offer faster processing speeds, greater storage capacity, and improved reliability.

=Resource Allocation Competition (RAC)=
The [https://docs.alliancecan.ca/mediawiki/index.php?title=Resource_Allocation_Competition Resource Allocation Competition]  will be impacted by this transition, but the application process remains the same. <br>
2024/25 allocations will remain in effect on retiring clusters while each cluster remains in service.  The 2025/26 allocations will be implemented everywhere once all new clusters are in service.<br>
Because the old clusters will mostly be out of service before all new ones are available, if you hold both a 2024 and a 2025 RAC award you will experience a period when neither award is available to you. You will be able to compute with your default allocation (<code>def-xxxxxx</code>) on each new cluster as soon as it goes into service, but the 2025 RAC allocations will only become available when all new clusters are in service.

| [https://youtu.be/nRX8zTIVEXk Migrating to the upgraded national systems] || SHARCNET || Sergey Mashchenko || Wednesday, July 30, 2025, 12:00pm EDT ||Most of the Alliance national systems have been undergoing a major upgrade during this spring and summer. They have been effectively rebuilt from scratch using up-to-date hardware, bringing a significant increase in computing capacity, memory, and storage to the users. The upgraded clusters have new names: Graham became Nibi, Beluga - Rorqual, Cedar - Fir, Niagara - Trillium. (The remaining cluster - Narval - is not having an upgrade this cycle.) Some of the upgraded systems are already online, not at a full capacity yet. The plan is to make all of them available by the end of July. <br><br>This webinar is to address the concerns and questions the users of the existing systems might have. How will the upgrade affect my workflow? Are there significant changes to the way the job scheduling and file systems operate in the new clusters? How to make the best use of the increased computing capacity of the upgraded clusters, in particular in regards of the computing nodes becoming much "fatter" (many more cpu cores per node)? As the most significant change will happen to the way the GPU computing is done, the webinar will cover this in detail. <br><br>There will be time for questions at the end, please bring your questions and concerns.  || Prospective users of the upgraded systems || Webinar; recordings and materials from previous SHARCNET webinars are available at [http://youtube.sharcnet.ca http://youtube.sharcnet.ca].  || Past

| [https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/enrol/index.php?id=210 Mastering GPU Efficiency] || SHARCNET || Sergey Mashchenko || Available Anytime || This online self-paced course provides basic training for [https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=112&displayformat=dictionary Alliance] users on using GPUs on our [https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=86&displayformat=dictionary national systems]. Modern GPUs (such as NVIDIA A100 and H100) are massively parallel and very expensive devices. Most of GPU jobs are incapable of utilizing these GPUs efficiently, either due to the problem size being too small to saturate the GPU, or due to the intermittent (bursty) GPU utilization pattern. This course will teach you how to measure the GPU utilization of your jobs on our clusters, and show how to use the two NVIDIA technologies - MPS (Multi-Process Service) and MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) - to improve GPU utilization. || Prospective users of the upgraded systems ||1-hour self-paced online course with a certificate of completion|| [https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/enrol/index.php?id=210 Access the course here/Alliance CCDB account is required]

| [https://youtu.be/pxY3G3BhwyA Survival guide for the upcoming GPU upgrades] || SHARCNET || Sergey Mashchenko || Wednesday, November 20, 2024, 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM ET || In the coming months, national systems will be undergoing significant upgrades. In particular, older GPUs (P100, V100) will be replaced with the newest H100 GPUs from NVIDIA. The total GPU computing power of the upgraded systems will grow by a factor of 3.5, but the number of GPUs will decrease significantly (from 3200 to 2100). This will present a significant challenge for users, as the usual practice of using a whole GPU for each process or MPI rank will no longer be feasible in most cases. Fortunately, NVIDIA provides two powerful technologies that can be used to mitigate this situation: MPS (Multi-Process Service) and MIG (Multi-Instance GPU). The presentation will walk the audience through both technologies and discuss the ways they can be used on the clusters. The discussion will include how to determine which approach will work best for specific code, and a live demonstration will be given at the end. ||Prospective users of the upgraded systems. Users intending to use a substantial amount of H100 resources (e.g., more than one GPU at a time, and/or over 24 hours runtime) || 1-hour [https://youtu.be/pxY3G3BhwyA presentation] and [https://helpwiki.sharcnet.ca/wiki/images/1/1d/MIG_MPS.pdf slides] || Past

= Frequently asked questions = 

== Will my data be copied to its new system? ==
Data migration to the new systems is the responsibility of each National Host Site who will inform you of what you need to do.

== Will my files be deleted when a system is undergoing a complete data center shutdown as part of renewal activities? ==
No, your files will not be deleted. During renewal activities, each National Host Site will migrate /project and /home data from the existing storage system to the new storage system once it is installed. These migrations typically occur during outages, but specific details may vary by National Host Site. Each National Host Site will keep users informed of any specific, user-visible effects. 
Additionally, tape systems for backups and /nearline data are not being replaced, so backups and /nearline data will remain unchanged. 
For further technical questions, please email [[technical support]]. This goes directly to our ticketing system, where a support expert can provide a detailed response.

== When will outages occur? ==
Each National Host Site will have its own schedule for outages as the installation of and transition to new equipment proceeds. As usual, specific outages will be described on [https://status.alliancecan.ca our system status web page]. We will provide more general updates on this wiki page and you will periodically receive emails with updates and outage notices.

== Whom can I contact for questions about the transition? ==
Contact our [[technical support]]. They will try their best to answer any questions they can.

== Will my jobs and applications still be able to run on the new system? ==
Generally yes, but the new CPUs and GPUs may require recompilation or reconfiguration of some applications. More details will be provided as the transition unfolds.

== Will the software from the current systems still be available? ==
Yes, our [[Standard software environments|standard software environment]] will be available on the new systems.

== Will commercial, licensed software be migrated to the new systems? ==
Yes, the plan is that the current commercial software licenses will be transitioned from an old system to the new replacement so to the extent possible users should see identical access to those special applications (Gaussian, AMS/ADF, etc.). There is a small risk that the software providers will change their licensing terms for the new system. Such issues will be addressed individually as they come up.

== Will there be staggered outages? ==
We will do our best to limit overlapping outages, but  because we are very constrained by delivery schedules and funding deadlines, there will probably be periods when several of our systems are simultaneously offline. Outages will be announced as early as possible.

== Can I purchase old hardware after equipment upgrades? ==
Most of the equipment is legally the property of the hosting institution.  When the equipment is retired, the host institution manages its disposal following that institution's guidelines. This typically involves "e-cycling"--- recycling the equipment rather than selling it. If you're looking to acquire the old hardware, it's best to contact the host institution directly, as they may have specific policies or options for selling equipment.
